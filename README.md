# MapChat

## Project Description
MapChat is a English practicing game where the player will control a character and navigate within a 2d map. Inside the map, there are locations that simulate day-to-day life such as grocery stores, coffee shops, gym, etc. As the character reaches one of these locations, the player will be given the conversation related to that location. The player will be given a quest, which contains several tasks (such as grab a coffee, by an orange, get a gym membership) that he/she needs to complete by going around the map.
