She worked diligently to keep me up to date on the process throughout the entire loan from start to finish.
I went in the branch to open an account.
Answered all the questions i had opening up an account and being my first credit union.
Very helpful with helping you better understand your banking options and needs.
I keep my business account here and they give me standard service not really much to say.
I have heard people talk about the poor treatment they have received at their banks.
The only thing i could say is change banks.
She worked diligently to keep me up to date on the process throughout the entire loan from start to finish.
I believe so that is the customer expects that level of service.
Bus will take you half a block from this bank.
Veteran from 1989 and finally switched all my banking over to usaa..
Member now for about 4 years, great customer service, and all their apps work great, !!
I've been with usaa for checking and savings since 2015.
I opened a new account a desert schools.
The service is great.
I like this bank.
Never had a problem..... who reviews banks?
I understand corporate banks but i mean i have too much time on my hands if i'm rating a bank
I would suggest anybody who banks with traditional banks give credit union one a try thanks
I've been banking with nsb for about 18 years and have not had any major issues.
I'm sorry but this is ridiculous, i'm glad that i have another bank that doesn't charge me for this service.
I stand to loose quite a bit of money if this doesn't close on time.
Best bank and branch around!
Great rates and awesome accounts!
Plus how awesome is it to have a bank right where you workout!?
Unbelievable customer service and know how from heather white, one of the bankers there.
I will be closing all my accounts at my 2 other credit unions and just deal with vantage west.
Rarely ever a line and excellent customer service!
They know what they're doing everything from their website navigation, user friendly online banking, and their superb customer service.
Whenever i called them about anything their customer service representatives have been angels.
As soon as i snag myself a full time job i am moving my checking account over to usaa.
I hate that and knowing i could get that money back would be awesome.
I love love love this bank.
We come in once a week as regulars and it's always an in and out along with great costumer service.
I've had bad experience at other banks and always felt they were setting me up for failure always felt cheated.
Fees every time for everything.i've been with us bank for 4 years now and i seriously can't say enough.
She was so nice and friendly and helped me set up my business account!
I applied for a auto loan refinance at a very attractive 2.98%.
Well, my review my differ from the others, but my experience at this bank of america has always been excellent.
Then, the bank manager wishes me a good day as i'm walking out the front door.
I was in and out the bank in less than 5 minutes.
When i did go inside the service was average compared to other locations i have been to.
Nothing spectacular, just the typical service you receive at other locations: professional.
Us bank is awesome!
Since i've made the switch to us bank i've been much happier.
I highly recommend us bank, especially the one on e sunset rd or the one by windmill & eastern.
A bank for those of us who work banker's hours.
Take it over to td to open a new account.
Not pushy about what to do with your money.
The folks here know what to do to get your money where you want it.
If you are looking for help with a home loan do not hesitate to call the a-team.
Financial service representative kyle miller was very helpful.
He is knowledgeable about the various products, and provided all the information i needed to open an account.
This is the bank inside the smith's store.
There is a full service bank branch in the same parking lot (why?
Who knows...), and we prefer to go to the store branch due to their customer service and general personalities.
Banking the errand that we all dislike.
Usually, the lovely computer does all of the banking with the proper stroke on the keyboard.
While here noticed that the bank is dead; and thirty minutes before closing.
The associate helping me asked all the proper questions about what the issue was with the account.
I just went to this bank to open a checking account/saving account and boy was i welcomed properly.
I can see why my grandfather has banked with this local state charter bank for years.
Also a military friendly bank!
Thank you nevada state bank!
No big deal when you get exceptional customer service that is sometimes tough to find.
I've been a life-long customer of td bank which then became td canada trust with a merge decades ago.
I prefer online banking.
Sometimes i have must use one of four green machine self-serve banking atms at the scarborough town centre branch.
Bank hours are quite broad so that's a plus!
Been a customer for years, hope services stay all great.
These guys have become my go-to moneychangers for foreign exchange purchases.
And the best part:  far, far better rates than my banks offer me, buying and selling back both.
This is the big royal bank location at the north-east corner of yonge and bloor.
I'm an rbc client and it's close to my work, so i now do most of my banking here.
The customer service is always a pleasurable experience and the tellers always know what they are doing.
I have been in many, many banks in my life, and most of them have been decent at best.
That is, until i walked intomidfirst bank, though.
For the most part, the desk service here is what you would expect from your average bank.
I have had some fantastic experience with the bankers in particular.
I've always been a fan of us bank and this branch lives up to what i have come to expect.
I was over at chase bank the other day along with my mom to open a new checking account.
They certainly have many safety features (22) you can choose from to bank online via your cell phone.
I recommend chase bank to everyone.
Some of the nicest people at a bank i have ever met.
Keep  up the great work and the great customer service.
I appreciate the good customer service.
When it comes to banking, i am all over the place.
What i want from a bank is straight forward answers.
Ultimately, even though they are not my primary bank, i would not hesitate to consolidate my funds over to chase.
Opened an account with pat today, great customer service and took the time to answer all of our questions!
I ended up opening a visa card after i was denied a small loan with them.
They did make me open up a checking and savings account and put a small amount in.
Usaa has been my one stop shop for banking, insurance, car buying service, life insurance, and financial advice.
He will remain legendary through his high quality of service provided.
I recently had one of the best banking experiences i've ever had at this branch.
I'm really happy with the customer service here, will definitely be back.
I came in here to get a 300 bonus for opening up a checking account.
Art and margaret went above and beyond all expectations while helping me set up an account with one nevada.
I've consistently found the tellers at this location provide better service than those in standalone branch buildings.
I recently purchased a home and used one nevada credit union for mortgage lending and insurance services.
I got quotes from several of the big banks and no one could match their rate or their closing costs.
I could not be happier with the service i received.
I highly recommend one nevada credit union for your banking, lending and insurance needs.
I have had accounts with them since 2001 and have never had a single negative experience.
I love this bank!
Im happy i bank with them.
Best bank i've banked with.
I was pleasantly surprised at the customer service offered at this location.
Moving closer to the front i could tell this line was to deposit or withdraw money.
I was very pleased with this credit union the staff was extremely friend when we were opening up an account.
The guy who helped us open the account was new cause his trainer was there helping him.
I called this bank, and spoke with an actual human instead of a computer system telling me to select options.
I knew right then that was the bank for me.
I was so happy with the person to person contact and the customer service here.
I am so pleased with my choice to go with nevada state bank, and this branch in particular.
They are an excellent bank that has never disappointed.
Excellent customer service, with the bank itself having a wonderfully inviting atmosphere, and free coffee never hurts!
Uwcu has got customer service completely figured out.
Excellent service to mary and her staff.
I love chase bank!
I have never had any fraudulent charges on my account due to their wonderful service.
Chase is a great bank that i would highly recommend!
The big advantage of this bank is its location.
Has always had friendly service, attentive to your needs.
God at customer service.
Because of the good customer service.
Highly recommend his services.
I personally much prefer banking at 500 yonge.
I had some problems with my account and he helped solve them.
Service has always been courteous and prompt.
They have great rates on loans and other financial tools that are also available on their website.
Love the customer service!
They treat you like family instead of just another customer or another number like most other banks.
Margaret and kyle are the very best banking professionals i have ever had the pleasure of doing business with.
They also have credit building tools such as 1k credit rebuilding loans.
As i said one nevada is the best and margaret and kyle are the best banking professionals.
Go see them and you'll see the difference between banking organizations that care and those that don't.
I have been banking with this credit union for over 30 years.
I also bank with chase, boa, and wells fargo.
Out of all of the banks, vantage west is by far superior.
I recently had a request to obtain statements for my accounts from 2011.
Dealing with your money can be overwhelming and stressful.
He not only gave us information on the bank itself but advised us on all the services they provide.
What struck me the most was that this is how banks used to be.
Open and friendly yet business like and not at all like the "big" banks out there.
This is the bank you might want to consider if you're tired of the mega banks.
Margaret mims gave us great service.
Customer service depends on when you go and what location.
My cars,car insurance,homeowners insurance,personal loan, and credit cards.
Their customer service is by far the best!
All i do is open the app and i can see all my accounts and pay bills.
Absolutely love this company and it's high standard of customer service!
However, the loan process and ease of it was great.
Opened an account here when received a 150$ offer to open an account in the mail.
I just so happened to be looking for a new bank so gave it a try.
After a little over 3 months i met all the requirements and received the 150$ in my account.
I also like their online banking and app very easy to use and great layout overall.
Sure they could use more locations but joining a smaller bank you know that going in.
And 150$ will go a long way to pay an occasional fee if i need to use another bank atm.
Again awesome online banking setup and bill pay.
I have been with nevada state bank for almost 10 years.
It's an excellent bank to bank with.
Nothing big where i needed to open up a new account somewhere else.
I like that there are a lot of these banks in town so it can be quite convenient.
Other than that, customer service has never been that bad.
I have been a member for 15 years, and kept our accounts as we moved around.
Service at uwcu is always amazing.
I didn't always value this, but i've used some bad online banking.
Oak bank far exceeded my expectations.
Do not go here if you are expecting a typical banking experience.
Even their mobile banking competes with large competitors, which can be a concern with smaller banks.
Do you want to trust your bank, even in this age of certainty?
Oak bank is personable and professional.
This place is worth checking out.
Chris austad was a true banking professional today!
He was able to help me through a situation where my accounts were compromised by fraudulent activity.
He gave me peace of mind and set me up with new accounts.
I will make this my new home bank of america!
This bank gives me faith in banking.
Chase bank is one of those exceptional banking institutions.
But your account is the quarterback- that is their job.
Chase, i'll continue to bank with you because you guys are awesome, and i love awesome.
Unfortunately  i have to pay their $3.00 fee & my bank's fee for using their atm.
Jessie gave me a number of good suggestions but did not try to "sell" me summit credit union services.
Ultimately i did become a member of summit by opening a couple of accounts with them.
Coming from bank of america most things were very similar.
They have a ton of good services they're just a step behind boa.
Best bank in town.
Highly recommend their services especially for business accounts.
After about 6 months with nevada state bank, we couldn't be happier.
Who knew a bank could be this good?
This bank is amazing!
Number two it is not at all connected to the usaa federal banking system.
You can not pay your credit card or access your federal account at all.
You can not cash checks unless you have an account with them.
Good features but not at all connected to the larger member services.
Pnc bank has one good thing going for it.
This is probably the only reason why i keep one of my accounts there.
They charge you ridiculous fees when you are cashing in on iras or their investment accounts.
Quite simply the gold standard of banking and insurance in my book.
I had an excellent experience at midfirst bank in fountain hills recently.
At the last minute i needed some documents notarized and i met with sherri c, assistant banking center manager.
I highly recommend this bank.
This bank was originally recommended to me by a friend 3 years ago who also couldn't say enough about them.
Margaret opened my teenage daughters account for her and spent so much time with her.
I am so grateful to have these ladies be apart of our banking experience.
I had the most amazing experience at this bank.
Thank you chase bank!
He always makes our personal and business banking experience easy and stress free.
My experience with this branch had always been positive (other banks just can't provide).
I just moved into town and have never opened a bank account separate from my parents.
I had the most amazing service from jose!!!!
This actually makes me excited to go to the bank now to deposit checks.
When i was younger, i had such a hard time with banks!
Its what you expect of a military bank.
I went into the bank today to resolve some charges on my account.
Omg it's a bank!
The service is polite and friendly.
The chase bank staff is great.
We recently moved to the scottsdale area and the bankers at this branch have been incredibly helpful since day one.
They've given us information to help us simplify our businesses and helped us with merchant services.
Deposits, wires, opening new accounts etc.
Great card good phone service never have a problem.
The bank manager here is outstanding too.
This location is the credit card underwriting office for usaa, not a branch of the main federal savings bank.
Located nearby to the headquarters, this uw credit union is a decent credit union for all your banking needs.
But of all the branches i've been to, this one does have really good customer service.
The banker i spoke to was patient and courteous when i asked my 101 questions.
If you need a bank and relationship manager/bankers, go to this location.
Some things could improve with regards to loans and underwriting but i'm loyal, overall.
I have been going to this bank for about a year now.
Of all the chase bank locations i've been to (which includes several states), this location is by far my favorite.
I love my bank.
Banking with them is so simple for me.
My go to bank, 15 min walk.
I was tired of paying such a high interest on my car loan i decided to refinance.
This review is for the us bank not inside the smith's (but shares a parking lot).
Anyway, i've been coming here for well over 4 years now as my main us bank branch.
The customer service here is always excellent.
Every time i called bay equity though someone was there to answer the phone and had great customer service.
On top of that, we had no fear whatsoever that our loan would close on time.
One nevada and monica martin helped me with a signature loan.
I handle all of my branch banking needs there and we even rent one of their safe deposit boxes.
I have been banking with onenevada for over 34 years.
Financial service rep margaret mims is amazing.
I give them one star for service here.
Trying to get through to any of the loan officers is impossible!!
I made a comment on their facebook page and a manager had another loan officer call me.
Our loan went smoothly thanks to ken sarna and his team at jfk.
I have banked with usaa for over seven years.
They are hands down better than any local bank.
We apply for all of our loans on our phone and have an approval fairly quickly.
We don't have their insurance, so i cannot vouch for that, but all other services are great.
I believe this location is just a satellite office that offers very little service.
Absolutely the friendliest staff and great service i love aloha pacific great cd special!
Aubrey has the best customer service!
She is a teller at the bank and always takes care of all my account needs!
Joe is the loan officer!
Amazing service every time!
Absolutely wonderful customer service!
It it's easier just to use the few atms on the outside the bank.
The banker was super sympathetic and helped me get a card right then and there.
I have always had friendly service.
I really enjoy banking here.
I'm opening a new account.
More so than my other bank who shall remain nameless.
Annnnd...i was given treats while i waited...and it wasn't those nasty suckers that other banks give out.
Review for merchant services....
This bank has the longest lines of any bank of america i have ever gone to in town.
The drive thru atms are usually being serviced.
The whole loan process could not have gone any smoother.
From the get-go the customer service was excellent.
We were greeted as soon as we walked in the bank, offered water and made quite comfortable.
Three separate bankers approached us to ensure we were being taken care of.
We opened an account and found the process to be quite easy, and for banking, surprisingly painless.
This experience was excellent, and mirrors all the previous experiences i had when they were servicing a different account.
I am very glad we made the decision to move our money to wells fargo.
Love this bank and all the people whom work here!
You do not find customer service like that in 2018.
If all bmo harris bank employees and policies were as customer centric, i would likely still be a customer.
My realtor recommended oak bank for my mortgage, and i'm so glad he did.
My email account cut out on me the day of the close.
I will definitely use oak bank again.
My wife and i just recently switched our banking services to us bank.
The process of opening our new account was quick and easy.
I came to nevada state bank after the customer service at my former back went south.
I have had nothing but great experiences with this bank.
Their loan department is great and very easy to work with.
I have had no issues with my accounts with this bank.
This us bank location is inside the smith's grocery.
We had lukewarm service at the stand-alone branch and prefer to go into the store branch.
We have never had any issues with customer service or accounts.
I then had to go to the bank to sign some paperwork, which she did not delay on at all.
Just started using this convenient bank as it has an external atm.
Good service  i've been a member of the credit union for a very long time.
I have a checking, savings, and ira account so i go to the credit union fairly often.
Overall, i would recommend this credit union, over big banks.
I don't normally write reviews, but recently i was at oncu and was really impressed with the customer service.
I was looking for auto loan information and he jumped to help me and answered all my questions.
The interest rates were good, but the customer service was stellar.
Went in yesterday for an appointment with tony g. we opened an account for my son.
This is my bank.
They have good customer service, and they also have a notary.
As long as i bank at chase, i will continue to bank here.
They patiently explained to me everything that went on with my auto loan and gave me everything that i needed.
I would recommend kylee for anyone who needs an auto loan.
As i am fairly new to the city of pittsburgh coming from ny i needed a local bank account.
I decided on pnc as they have both personal and business accounts and there are no fees.
I said i was interested in opening an account and they said it would just be a few minutes.
I am glad i choose this bank.
I've never experienced the drive through banking at this location but i never really see people waiting.
This is for the bank in the parking lot --not the smith's.
Even though i have moved from mcfarland i continue to use their services.
The price is great and the service we recieve is fantastic.
Excellent service provided by marlene.
Margaret gave the best service i have received in a credit union for as long as i can remember.
The bank itself is a five star for great service, but the parking...ugh...
Went in to open an account, and it was so fast and easy, i actually had a blast.
A nice change of pace compared to some other banks.
After a year of banking at this location i found the tellers to be very accommodating and courteous.
We use them for business banking and they have been wonderful to work with.
Kyle miller my car loan officer was a great help in getting my financing completed.
They welcomed me with open arms and the customer service is great!
Highly recommend banking with 1 nevada!
I definitely recommend, if your looking for a local bank, that makes you feel at home.
This is our second loan closed with bay equity and we will use them again in the future.
Clayton is the best business banker!
This banker kenneth is gold!
I have bought and sold several homes and i would never use any one else for a purchase loan again.
I do banking and insurance through usaa and i love their customer service.
If your tired of being treated as an account number at your bank, you'll love arizona federal credit union.
This was one of the best experiences we had with a loan officer.
They do have great customer service, they take care my money well, and i enjoy doing business with them.
I have been banking with one nevada credit union for 7 years.
Kyle at the summerlin branch is by far one of the most customer service oriented workers i have met.
I have my auto loan with them and i have 3 other accounts with them.
The customer service at this location is top notch.
Bankers and managers are very knowledgeable.
Money saved, lessons learned, and amazing results with my policies.
State farm saved me so much money in comparison.
Could not ask for better & easier loan!
Thank you once again for the awesome customer service, that is rare.
Well another good experience at the first bank i ever enjoyed going to.
I recently refinanced my auto loan with one nevada credit union.
I would like to commend margaret mims for her outstanding customer service.
I have been with another bank since beginning college 9.5 years ago.
2) 3 bank accounts linked together-- spend (checking), reserve (savings) & growth (long term savings) .
No need to open 3 separate accounts  3) checking and savings have unlimited transfer.. something my current bank doesn't offer.
6 transfers then they charge you $10 to transfer your own money.. ugh.
It's seriously the best banking i have ever had!
Customer service at this branch is top-notch.
Ricardo brown is the branch manager and he's an excellent banker.
Wouldn't want to sit down with anybody else for my banking needs.
Full disclosure:   this is not my personal bank, but i go often with family members who bank there.
The bank is clean, parking is plentiful and the lines move very quickly.
I love this bank.
They are very efficient and know the banking products.
Darlene was so understanding and patient with us and went above and beyond normal customer service.
For a hands on banking experience, i recommend this branch.
I came in because someone suggested i try them for banking.
I'm so glad i decided to bank with them.
Nextier bank is by far one of the best banks around.
I have even started the process in moving my personal accounts to nextier.
They have always been great service and i love the app as well!
Wouldn't change banks i have had bad experiences with other banks!
I opened a savings account with dsfcu years ago and have to say, i really like this bank.
I eventually opened a credit card account with 0% financing to pay off some debt.
When alliant, another credit union that took on my car loan, completely failed me, i simply switched to dsfcu.
However, based on my experiences, i recommend this bank and branch.
I wasn't happy, but i actually receive all of the money back at the end of the year in dividends.
They meet my needs, so i won't be closing any of my accounts.
I can't say that i would recommend them, but only because my banking needs with them are fairly simple.
Thank you, you awesome bank of america atm.
Although you don't talk much, you provide extremely fast and efficient service.
Clients like me appreciate good customer service.
Opened a checking and savings at this location the other day.
Mogo provides a good service for someone who does not want to have a credit card balance.
He is able to get loans closed within 30 days or less.
I am not a big-bank fan.
If you want a good bank where you will actually enjoy the experience, this is where you want to be!
Always on top of the ball with their customer service except one.
They are very pleasant and quick and dont solicit a ton of services like retail banks.
I was where's from out of town ..lines were pretty busy but customer service is great.
I opened up an account here for my wife today.
The banker had a great sense of humor and it was simple and straightforward.
I've been a member of this bank for about 5 years.
If you just need to do a fast transaction, the line moves very quickly and costumer service is a excellent.
The yearly dividends, great customer service, the best rates.
I've had mortgages with them, checking, savings and cc.
I deposit all my checks on my phone directly to my usaa account.
My paycheck is directly deposited to my usaa checking account.
Service - the teller was great.
He was helpful, easy going, professional and gave me some advice about accounts for my teens that was actually helpful.
If you go to the atm inside the bank, you generally get 20's only.
Overall, i liked the service and the friendliness.
The armed forces bank on rickenbacker rd.
However i don't really understand how to bank here.
Great bank, super friendly staff and, well, there's always candy lol.
Several time they have helped me when there was fraud activity on my account.
I really appreciate the service at this branch.
I've been to this huntington bank location, oh, about 4 times since moving to the area in february.
Not your typical plain old ho-hum-looking bank building.
Brianna has the best customer service that i've had in a while.
Great service, always knowledgeable and courteous.
I've baked with boa, chase, and american savings in the past.
Usaa blew all of them away, as far as service.
I have confidence leaving my money in their bank.
My time with her was smooth and she covered all details, notably my favorite banker interaction.
I've been with this office for years and i'm always satisfied with their service.
I don't have generally good stories about banks...but then again, who does?
With mega-banks you are less of a customer and more of a number.
She even walked me to the atm to show me how my account and card would work.
They work with you on life insurance, auto loans, home loans, all things financial.
This is probably one of the friendliest banks i've been in.
I had to conduct some business at chase bank.
The offer a high level of customer service.
Their rates (loans and deposits) are competitive.
Again, their customer service is top notch.
I have never received better customer service from a bank than what i have received from monona state bank.
I feel like i am a valued member at my local bank.
It's the way all banks should be.
It's the kind of banking that makes a customer say wow.
Upon entering the bank we were immediately greeted and seated with bottle water.
Just started banking with one nevada.
The customer service is amazing.
The teller that opened my account is named shelly.
Couldn't ask for better service.
Especially in today's society, where good service seems to be on the decline.
So happy we bank with them!
This is probably one of the best wells fargo banks in arizona!
I would recommend banking with these guys!
I can't really tell between an average bank and an extremely good bank.
But i can tell between an average bank and a really crappy one.
This was one of the worse banking experiences i have ever had .
From my experience with him isaac he could use more customer service training.
They do everything the bank is supposed to do.
Bank of america has been giving me problems with my account...
I came in to resolve some of my issues of my bank account and i got the best service ever.
The banker who helped me the name was victor .
I'm a satisfied costumer and would recommend this bank to anyone!
This bank is great.
They are very friendly and i have my business accounts here.
Much better than bank of america, my last bank.
Still have my ira through them, but it's much easier banking where there's a branch.
This boa branch is always clean and the service is always friendly and quick.
And i have never waited in a long line like at other banks (or boa branches).
Need more bankers that look like you:)
We have traditionally had really great service from this branch.
He checked to make sure there was no suspicious activity on my account, which there wasn't.
It was honestly the easiest customer service experience i've ever had!
Devon, thank you for restoring my faith in customer service!
I have never felt so welcomed and been treated so kindly in a bank before...
Very well dressed,  and super clean interior of the bank.
This bank is the best one i've been too ever!
The customer service is spectacular!
The bankers are so friendly and will help you with whatever you need!
I recommend christian if you need help with banking or anything that comes to mind!
Nora poblador helped me with several changes to my accounts today.
I opened an account over a year ago, and i have nothing but great things to say about the bank.
Always providing great insight and mentioning all the different things that we as account holders, one nevada has to offer.
I have been treated amazing by one nevada since i first opened my account.
Came in to open an checking and savings account and maggie was absolutely amazing!
Love the fact there's a bank inside the gym.
You can do all your banking needs before or after your workout.
This is a full service branch.
If you need a car loan to even a home mortgage, they can help you with it.
Free checking accounts for military & students.
I have banked with this credit for some 30 years;  in those years i have had few complaints.
I find their customer service is excellent.
Just the way the big banks like it!
Now the issue is to fund that account while incurring the least amount of transaction fees.
Luckily, wf personal bankers have no such limitations (at least my bank account is not that big, yet).
My parents set up a savings account for me here when i was little.
I have always gotten excellent customer service.
I now have saving and checking accounts as well as vehicle and home loans.
I always come back because i  appreciate his high calibre of service and is always on point!
Also, they do currency exchanges without any hassle or runaround, which again, is something that is rare in modern banking.
Based on the amount of sgd the bank would give me for my cad,  it confirmed i was right!
I've dealt with many banking institutions but none come close to the customer service of this branch and organization.
Setting up accounts (6 of them) is quick!
Feels like a great group of friends when i go to the bank.
In fact, my kids like to go to the bank because of the people (and lollipops!)
I simply re-scheduled for the next day, but i had never experienced this issue with any bank before.
Both bankers and tellers are very knowledgeable and always ready to help.
But obviously that's not bankers fault so i didn't wanted to take the star out because they deserve 6!
I am a very satisfied accountholder and plan to stay with this credit union for a long time to come.
This is the slowest bank in the wells fargo network.
Most wells fargo banks that you go to, the tellers are friendly.
At the end of the day, if they can achieve my banking needs, they get a 3 star review.
I love this location out of all of the u.s. bank locations that i have frequented.
I'm always greeted by friendly bankers.
I like free standing us bank locations over the in-store locations.
The customer service guy was great and friendly.
Service was quite fast and the line were kept short and sweet.
All in all its another branch from bmo but with good great service!
I will always bank with chase and it will always be at this branch.
But this bank is the best.
Let me say, becoming a member here has been a revelation to me in banking.
Great services, great customer service.
My fifth third of choice, quick and the personal banker is extremely helpful every time .
Will bank with them for years to come
Great service and great clients!
Had a great experience opening a new account with us bank.
The teller walked me through the products and services they offer.
I opened an account with desert schools credit union years ago.
I never did much with them since i have accounts at another bank as well.
I decided to start looking at options for an auto loan and figured i'd revisit ds.
After no wait at all, one of their loan specialists (jeremy) introduced himself and showed me to his desk.
Since it was such a big amount of money, we wanted to deal with a person, not a machine.
Anyways, we got there at about 4:30, knowing banks close at five normally.
Since this is close to our house, i'm sure we'll be here more often than any other bank of america.
Service: their service here is great.
They're really nice and they also offer more accounts and etc to up sale.
They also have lots of people working the regular, employer-serviced drive through lanes.
I have opened both personal and professional accounts here.
Exceptional customer service provided by knowledgeable staff.
Definitely go here to open an account
I really like midfirst bank!
Great service and i feel like they really are there for me!
Kyle miller helped me with a loan.
It was a great banking experience.
If used several different banks so far and chase has been the one the most satisfies my financial needs.
This specific location has great customer service and makes sure everyone is helped as soon as possible.
Banking has been excellent customer service as well, even with dealing with complex fraud issues.
My favorite bank of choice and i've used a few over my years.
I will be a forever nevada state bank customer.
I wouldn't bank anywhere else!
I really like this bank too, i come in here to buy the money orders to pay my son's tuition.
Keep up the great work and great service!
Bank charges financial institutions are willing to charge their customers.
The customer service at this location is phenomenal!
Chris helped my beautiful lover, christine,  and i open a joint checking account.
I always get excellent customer service here, in and out in less than 5 minutes.
Sorry so short, but not much to say about a bank...lol!
I had some challenges with my account and scott mulvan was great about helping fix it.
Customer service here is way above average!
When my husband and i got married 9 years ago he had this account.
I was not sure about it because i have always used banks.
They loaned us money for a car at a much lower interest rate.
The i retest on our savings is better than the bank.
Even we i move i'm going to be coming here for all my banking needs
Great service and great price!
Currently i have my auto insurance, renters insurance, auto loan, and life insurance with this agency.
They continue to help me save money on my insurance and everyone is very friendly.
Hands down some of the best customer service i have ever received.
Eventually, we'll be transferring all of our banking and insurance over to them..
National bank just moved to their new chi-chi location in the new development off bayview ave.
Chris was great helping me with opening another account today.
They were able to complete our purchase loan from start to finish in 14 days.
I highly recommend them for any of your home loan needs.
Great rates on loans and credit card.
I no longer live in wi and i still bank with summit, all online and through cu services.
Well you know what, don't get mad the next time your account gets breached.
It's a bank, not the express line at walmart.
As banks go, chase has gone a long way to improve.
They have the scan your check feature allowing you to deposit checks without actually going to the bank.
This bank of the west location is by far the most friendly, knowledgeable staff in las vegas.
Thank you for your service and on-going professionalism.
They have great customer services i will definitely come back.
The chase banker was able to resolve the issue on the spot and bring the customer's anxiety down.
This is presently my branch of bank of america.
I appreciated the quick and compassionate service, as i was pretty freaked out.
Were excellent the 2nd time around, with constant updates on the status of my loan app and follow through.
I had my loan documents a day after approval and overnighted it back to them by fed-ex, at their expense.
Best customer service from margaret mins!
I've been with this bank for almost 10 years and i wouldn't bank anywhere else!
Service is generally pleasing aside from the rude fa who occupied the office beside the csr section.
My problem was that another person was getting emails about an account they aren't on.
He made sure that the person's email or phone number wasn't on that account anywhere, which it wasn't.
I did end up closing down the account.
Occasionally, i have had to go in and the customer service has been great.
Wonderful experience, i really hate going in to the bank.
We tried to get pre-approval letters from our banks and no luck.
I was in a tight spot and needed some money to pay bills.
Tellers provided great customer service, they were very pleasant and courteous.
I like uwcu on the whole, but i was unimpressed by the service at this location.
This was the smoothest transaction i've ever had in closing a loan.
I can't say enough about the level of service i received.
So i was in a jam and needed some money to pay my rent.
Borrow money against your car?
Nobody wants to review a title loan place because it's really embarrassing.
Jeremy clemena, a member advocate at the branch, recently helped me with a small loan.
If you are looking for a loan, opening an account, financial advice, and more, don't hesitate to go to jeremy!
Opened a checking account with art!
Easiest account setup ever!
I needed a loan and she made the process simple and easy to understand.
I would recommend maximum title loans in chandler!
Not the greatest costumer service.
This was just the one that caused me to make the decision to change banks.
It's good to know great service is available.
What made me more happy is their rate is better than any bank!
Thank you so much for your service!
I'll never go back to a bank.
There's something about the service here that makes this hsbc branch superior to the others.
Excellent exchange rates and great customer service.
I am very pleased with the level of service i have received from clearview federal credit union.
As a member/owner, i don't feel that i am in reach of understanding and participating in their banking decisions.
Great rates for my entire family and i even saved money on my home insurance.
From the reviews on this bank location i was kind of spective of it.!
I was attended very quickly, by second i walked in by a bank teller.
But the key is the customer service, because their staff genuinely gives a damn about you, and treats you well.
Actually a very pleasant transaction when i normally don't ever have anything but complaints about banks.
Customer service was great in helping me locate books i wanted.
Bank reps are helpful and get you going.
Like others have stated, great customer service and polite even though i was in after closing.
Best customer service ever for a bank!
Tremendous service and people.
Been banking there for over 10 years now without an issue
I recommend them if you need your money exchanged!
This bank is like flipping a coin.
I went into open a savings account and it was an extremely pleasant experience.
The lady assisting me was friendly, knowledgeable, and helped make sure i got the right account that suited me.
Still a great bank, very clean and usually never busy.
I had to wait to see a banker but it was during the lunch hour so i could understand.
Opened a checking account and it was pretty easy no hassle at all.
The few times i've been inside this bank there's been  no one else there.
So naturally they were pretty quick with service.
Quick and easy money exchange at great rates.
You have many choices when it comes to banking, branches like this make me wonder why others still exist.
I'm no billionaire, more like a thousandaire but they treat me respect and service that is unmatched.
Allstars in the banking biz
Miss dejanay sollas was the banker who assisted me.
I needed to refinance my auto loan.
She is kind and her customer service is unbelievable.
I also asked her to open me accounts and she proceeded with grace.
She should be a role model for all bankers nationwide.
I couldn't be more impressed with teresa or happier with our choice for his first bank.
Thanks to a couple employees at this location, they helped me solve an uncommon checking account situation immediately.
Would definitely recommend if you're planning on opening a new account or credit card.
My bf and i finally decided to make the commitment and open a joint checking account for our bills.
I would definitely recommend him for your banking needs.
I went into one nevada to get the details on an auto loan.
I will absolutely be returning to one nevada to see linda whenever i need help with financial services.
I've had three car loans including my most recent purchase of my outlander candy apple red beauty.
So make sure to ask for justin when needing a loan and he'll make sure everything works out smoothly.
Great service by janet at this bank.
Great rates, friendly and helpful service.
Branch employees do seem to be laid back in asking about accounts most of the time.
Needed to wire some money fast.
The customer service was above and beyond what anyone would expect.
I was supremely pleased to know that there was no minimum to open the account for a child.
The service is always great and friendly, but this last visit really impressed me.
Without brining anything into the review like interest rates or services offered i'll provide a review.
Whether you have to go to just the window or back to speak with a banker the workers are friendly.
My father had his account here, and my credit union in california can be serviced from here.
Service: when my father passed away last year, i had to deal with desert schools for my fathers financials.
But in time, everything was able to be transferred into the estate account.
Just opened account, received wonderful service and so far so good.
The checking account had no fees and includes rewards as well.
Thank enjoy your own money
Great bank so far.
They seem like good neighborhood bank.
I have never had to wait more than 10 minutes to be seen at this bank!
Grade a service on all fronts.
I stop at this location after work sometimes and i find it to be very convenient with drive up banking!
When you pull in where i did, you have to drive up and around to get to the bank.
Greg and state farm bank made it very simple and painless.
Loan was funded quickly and with ease.
Their customer service is great and would highly recommend them.
Twas the  friday before new years and the bank seemed to be packed.
Great service and a great company.
Thanks bank of america and thanks victor
She's very helpful, patient,  and ensures my banking needs are met.
Went to open an account for my 16 yr old daughter.
The bank attendant who helped us was so clear and understanding.
She received her bank card today and screamed with excitement.
Not really sure why, because she is saving for college.
The best customer service.
In order to establish nv residency, i had to get a local checking account.
I researched all the lv and nv banks and this is the one that i picked.
Setting up my new account was very easy, and the customer service at this branch was great.
Overall, i have been happy with my new account, and happy with my choice.
The service is so personal!
It's not my favorite location but i love the bank.
Extremely reasonable better than bank, airport amex any of them.
Save your money and go here
At the counter, the bankers always offer my children a sucker before leaving.
Went in to set up a checking account for my trust and the process was super simple.
In planning my first trip to europe, i was getting overwhelmed at the thought of exchanging money.
What a breath of fresh(non-corporate banking mentality) air.
I opened a wells fargo account since they have tons of branches.
After changing jobs, my work once again had an account with pnc, and i am responsible for making work deposits.
For the most part, it's a bank...go in, cash checks, make deposits, withdraw, etc.
For the most part, banking here in a common way is fine.
But should you need to bank on a deeper, m,ore complex level, avoid this woman at all costs.
Great customer service skills!
My husband should of re counted the money as well before he left.
But it does not even look like a bank, in the traditional way.
I had to exchange euros for dollars recently and foreign money exchange came very highly recommended here on yelp.
All this even though i have an account at the bank.
My bank can suck it.
Banks are banks, and generally evil.
The people who work here are quite nice and make the bank a reasonable experience.
The tellers seem friendly but i rarely actually go to the bank anymore.
Got to love online banking and direct deposits :)
Best bank i've ever used!
Great customer service at the bank itself.
I can't physically use the atm so i go inside to make deposits, and i always get wonderful service.
I was provided excellent service and was made to feel welcomed.
I really appreciate receiving first class service.
I stop here from time to time and i have always been pleased with the service i recieve here.
They are a full service state farm agency.
They also offer financial services.
I called today and spoke with joey, i needed assistance with one of my patients bank accounts.
Absolutely incredible customer service and so easy to exchange at the current rate, no additional charges.
Recently, i spoke with jean for an auto loan and she was extremely friendly and personable!
Central illinois was my first bank account out of high school and i love them.
I'm leaving central illinois and leaving this bank is going to be one of the hardest parts.
With their new acceleration banking, it's the best rates i've come across.
Service was always personal and (up until a few years ago) i always recognized faces.
You're trying to draw in people who don't want to bank with big banks...so don't be one.
But hey, it's just a simple banking branch on the west side...
Considering it is in a huge busy building it was actually empty in the bank.
This office has one of the best customer service i have ever seen.
If anything you're holding me up because the bank makes no money off you.
Here's a solution: manage your money better.
Also, taking a picture in a bank makes you a creeper.100% creeper!
Make sure to take your parking ticket with you to get it validated by the foreign money exchange too!
The services are really good and the staff is really friendly.
I came in to update my code for my sf bank card (yes, state farm has a bank people!)
She was very helpful in getting me in contact with sf bank.
I am impressed with one of the banker, her professionalism, knowledge, and just the way she is... a great person!!!
This is customer service, treat everyone equally.
This is my favorite bank of all time.
I've been a loyal customer since community bank of nevada fell to fraud and they haven't let me down since.
Oh my godddddd, it took forever to just take some money out at the teller (i misplayed my bank card).
Thank you all for the exceptional service and smiley faces
Great customer service happens every time i visit this location, i have started skipping the atm.
Ive been banking here for a little over a year and so far its been a great experience.
I was scheduled to have money taken out for an automatic payment on the 5th.
This is what a great bank does!
Could not be happier with banking with cib but only have a slight complaint.
Open a checking account and chase will give you $150.00 after your first direct deposit ..
Gotta say - i wasn't really expecting such good and personal service.
I have been banking here for years.
While i am okay with the overall experience, in my opinion there isn't enough atm's for in car banking.
I rather enjoy the bank, but they do not offer on hand euro for traveling overseas.
They do not offer coffee or lollipops as some banks do.
Honestly, so much of your experience here depends on the teller or other banking professional who assists you.
Love the banking side, have had many loans with them through out the years.
Then, would need to explain that we are self employed, we want to pay off only these two accounts.
It is usually difficult to get very happy with any bank.
By their very nature banks tend to suck...
He set up accounts for ar, ap and equity.
This means that this particular banking center is a well trafficked area.
So if you don't want to wait for service?
I worked specifically with a banker named gia tongol (i believe that's her last name).
As far as service goes, she did everything i asked of her and was very cheerful and good with conversation.
To the ladies at foreign money exchange, thanks for helping me out for the past sixteen years!
I was introduced to a personal banker named candice moore.
I will be coming back to this branch just to bank with candice.
I've banked with both the cotswold and noda branches... both have always been great to work with.
Oddly enough, fifth third bank does not serve food.
That's probably why this awesome bank only has 2 reviews.
I no longer have to worry about getting my checks to the bank; i can deposit them from anywhere, anytime.
Best thing to happen in my personal-banking life!
Came in to this bank to wire money.
The teller we spoke to was nice and referred us to the banking manager linda.
We will definitely be using this branch for our banking needs.
If that's kind of customer service doesn't deserve five stars i must be missing out on something.
I went in here to open a checking account.
The bank is very clean and everyone was very professional.
So far...the experience has been great...i'll write another review after more time with the account.
Anna grigoryan provided the best banking service i've ever had with wells fargo.
I had some issues with wells fargo dealer services and the disconnect between the bank and the loan provider.
Anna is the best banker i've ever dealt with at any wells fargo branch.
If you need any issues resolved with your personal banking, i would highly recommend speaking with anna.
I will always bank with a "credit union" as opposed to a "bank".
This really reduces how many times i need to actually visit the bank.
Also, a unique and powerful feature of credit union banking is "shared branch banking".
There are credit unions closer to where i live (arizona federal and truwest) that offer shared branch banking with fcu.
If i need to, i can go into their location and withdraw funds or make deposits into my fcu account.
She even followed up to check and see how things were going with the account.
I need to stop by and deposit some money so i find this gem.
The staff here are the friendliest i've ever met at a bank.
This place definitely understands the idea of customer service.
If i lived in phoenix, i would go out of my way to bank here.
Now when does this happen in the banking industry??
Very unhappy with wells fargo so went looking for somewhere else to put my money.
We were fortunate enough to get dejanay as our financial service representative.
She even explained why she stopped working at a traditional bank.
I manage a call center and know what good customer service looks like and this is it.
After extensive research, one nevada credit union is going to be my bank!
Stopped in this evening and was immediately helped by the branch manager who explained all the great services to me.
Kyle re-explained the account choices and benefits!
While i've been to many td branches, i want to highlight this one for their regularly excellent service.
I have never had the personal service as i have had with this specific insurance agency.
They continually attempt to save me money on all services rendered, to give me the very lowest possible prices.
I am amazed at the service and the amazing staff that is available to me from a mere phone call.
They always keep me well informed of any new services that are available to myself or my family.
This to the customer service i am used from the branches in indiana.
It is my humble opinion that all banks suck.
With that said, i actually like the people that work at my citibank.
One star was deducted because they are a bank, all banks have some crappy policies.
I checked the exchange rate online before heading into foreign money exchange and their rate was spot-on.
They also told me they exchange money from u.s. to other nations currency.
The staff is efficient, kind and lead by a great bank manager.
To anyone who banks with jp morgan chase in surprise this is an excellent place to bank.
Banking should assist you, not be painful, this branch makes sure of that.
For once in my life i actually got great service.
I have nothing bad to say about the service i received.
I opened an account with kyle miller at the e. serene location and he was extremely helpful, friendly and knowledgeable.
This is an excellent small bank that treats their customers with respect.
If you are in need of a bank/credit union you should give this place a chance.
Brad at e loans has been very pleasant to work with.
*would i recommend 1/1 star, ill recommend because the store is nice but please work on your customer service.
I used to work at a bank and then you got all your interest from savings.
Most bankers scuffle but she made sure i was filling them out correctly!
I have dealt with him multiple times including setting up high school checking accounts for my teens.
He does a great job instructing the teens on banking issues.
No doubt there is too much paperwork involved in opening accounts anywhere, but justin makes it as painless as possible.
The service has been consistent, professional, and efficient, as each time my transactions have not been straightforward or quick.
Thank you to all for your service & efficiency, much appreciated.
(the bank itself is conveniently located & clean, and the greeter was helpful & friendly)
Old bank but does the job and the lines are not as bad as the other reviews.
Jamieson was extremely helpful in setting up my account and my kids' accounts.
I love this chase bank!
This is a great bank/credit union location just off the las vegas strip.
Great service, easy parking in the underground garage, and the exchange rate was fair.
Signed up online for a joint account, my document to sign came through fine, hubby's we had issues with.
What good is a bank that you can't get your money out of?
Great customer service and thank you for your prompt attention and assistance.
This branch of wells fargo consistently provides me with the best banking experience i've had.
Kelvin and his staff are friendly and courteous and understand customer service.
This pnc is like most other pnc banks.
A little bit slower than the bigger banks but more personalized service.
This is a great place to exchange money.
I've banked here less than a year, but i have had nothing but top rate service so far!
I originally applied for a checking and savings account online.
Most of my direct dealings have been on the phone or using the drive-thru, but their customer service is excellent.
I've experienced nothing but positive service from this branch.
Fast, friendly service, and a personal salutation are the norm.
Truly enjoy utilizing this branch for my banking needs.
My fave bank location because of the merchant teller.
Their buy rate is very, very good compared to other banks.
I have only banked with this location for a couple of months, through my employer, and they are awesome.
Running to the bank is not a task, it's a joy, all because of this group of people.
Generally, this bank is understaffed.
For sure my next exchange will be with foreign money exchange...
Will be back for sure for any needs to exchange money.
This place is cheaper than my bank wells fargo.
Linda really helped me out with opening an account today.
She was prompt so i wasn't in there a long time like other banks.
She also explained to me the options i had about setting up different accounts to better my credit.
I will definitely go back to see her when i have any questions, or want to open any other accounts.
If i ever decide to switch banks (which is always a possibility) this place is my first choice.
Friendly tellers, always good service
I recently had an issue with our account, i went in quite upset.
David also mentioned passing our information along to someone who can handle our accounts to offer a more personalized service.
I will never go back to a bank ever again.
I applied for a loan on a sunday night.
I kid you not... by 10am the next day, i was approved and the money was in my account.
Good customer service brionne!
Thumbs up to midfirst bank.
We have our business account with them and there was some fraudulent activity.
They caught it before i did and acted immediately saving me what could have been a lot of money.
It just reaffirms our decision to move our business to this great bank.
We first went to midfirst when looking to refinance our business loan.
Now after this i am even more impressed with the bank and the staff.
I decided to convert over to chase from another well known bank, and i'm glad i did!
Frankie was the banker that helped me and he was so nice and friendly.
Very happy with the customer service so far :).
I needed to prove to a mortgage company that i had made a deposit in the bank of america.
I walked across the street and found three at this bank.
I actually got good service from a bank.
Gigi in accounts was very helpful and nice.
I got 2 accounts set up with no issues or problems.
Thank you chase bank.
The banker who helped us was very nice and friendly.
They had a promotion where they'd give $125 after the first direct deposit to anyone opening a new chase checking.
This branch has drive up banking, which is very convenient, and everyone is always very friendly and helpful.
My experience with foreign money exchange was good.
My wife and i love wells fargo bank.
Very polite, knowledgable people, great hours, the kind of bank everyone hopes for.
Opened an account pretty quickly, no issues, very helpful staff and learned about a credit union to boot.
Best bank of america, ever!
We bank at a lot of locations; everyone here makes your business feel valued!!!
This is my guy's bank.
Can't speak highly enough about banker zack tribby!
My personal banker cabrina le, is always ready to answer my questions, and solve my problems.
This is the to go to place if you are in las vegas nevada and you need your money/currency exchanged.
Banks don't have certain currencies in stock and you have to order it a week in advance.
It's available for same day service.
This is a small wittle bank.
Looks like i found my new bank
Banker alicia is a great person and very passionate banker.
She helped me with​ my banking issue very helpful way.
It didn't seem like i went to banker rather it felt like i was talking to my friend.
For her customer service,​ i will give 5 .
This bank is huge with plenty of tellers to help you.
This branch always provides excellent customer service, thank you boa!
Darian, our personal banker had called to see if we needed to refi our car.
I scheduled w/ darian for that & also for mom to get help on her new account.
I can appreciate honest customer service.
I like all of the wells fargo's & their online & atm services, but this particular one is awesome.
Next time you're in there, be patient & enjoy good customer service that is hard to find.
This is a great branch of huntington bank.
There is never a line for service.
I would bank at huntington bank only because of this branch and the service that i receive.
If you are looking for a great little downtown bank this is it!!
Sherryll is my bank lady, she's got a great personality and a strong handshake.
Amazing customer service at this location too.
I've been banking here for over 2 years now, love it.
I always love my wells fargo banks and like this one mostly for it's convenient location.
Came in and was helped quickly, the teller was friendly and provided good service.
The bank was clean and had multiple tellers available for help.
Online banking is easy to use.
Now i am thrilled because of the educational services she provided.
Great service  dori the manager and her team are very professional and kindness!
I think i am going to establish a new account with this bank.
Highly recommend this bank for all your financial needs.
Thank you george dammeir for being great at what you do and offering fantastic customer service!
I have to say that in all that time, i have always received friendly and attentive service from this office.
I love banks that are in old historical buildings!
I assisted my client with his banking needs and the staff person was very nice and helpful.
After my bank turned me down (told me to go to the airport!
The customer behind me in line suggested foreign money exchange.
I'm so grateful the guy behind me at the bank knew about this place.
I've said it before when reviewing other fcu branches, and i'll say it again:  banks suck!
First credit union is not a bank.
Service is better, fewer (and smaller) fees, and a full-range of services.
Banks take too long and make you jump through hoops to get financing.
Prudent is a much better alternative when you need a quick loan.
This is one of the few full service branches of citibank still left in vegas.
It has all the services but it will be busy most of the time.
Toni marie has also helped with deposits and ira accounts.
Both with the tellers and the sit down bankers.
I recommend coming to this branch if you bank with chase.
It's in a shopping center with harris teeter, along with several other smaller shops & services.
I have banked here for years and have been very happy with their services.
I have personal accounts and business accounts
I've been banking here since i was young.
Highly recommend banking with midfirst!
Probably one of my least favorite wells fargo banks that i have to unfortunately hit every once in awhile.
I probably spend more money on gas than the $2 additional charge.
Great bank, excellent location on the corner of scottsdale rd.
Security guard stand on-duty during normal bank hours.
This bank is very close to my house.
I am very happy with my customer service here every time.
My experience was hassle free and i recommend goodmortgage.com for competitive rates and superior customer service.
I will always exchange my money here before going on a trip, great rates!
Open an account for the benefits and diversify your funds.
Take your ticket with you to be validated at foreign money exchange.
As soon as you enter, foreign money exchange is on the left side.
Very nice location, customer service is very good.
I have been a client of td for over 15 years now and am extremely satisfied with banking there.
How can you beat this service?
It's never busy they're always friendly and they get me the money.
That said, the people at this branch do offer decent service and are concerned with doing the right thing.
Pam and everyone at the bank are very nice and provide great service.
Have been there for 15 years and never have had any issues with the service.
I really do love my bank, as strange as that sounds.
Td canada trust offers customers great banking solutions  during hours that actually work for them.
Additionally, when i was recently visiting nyc, td had banks everywhere.
Amador in the business services dept was very helpful and easy to get along with.
All of my mortgage and personal services were handled professionally.
Met with personal banker, chris, who was very polite and professional.
I have used a bunch of their services including the 24 hours atm and notary.
Came here as another location (desert inn and durango) didn't have the sufficient staff to provide the service...
It has quite the .... different design than a normal bank....
Bankers to the left, tellers to the right.
According to the banker who helped me, this was the design of the previous wamu.
Banker stated card will arrive in about a week in a non-labeled white envelope.
No bank is perfect.
The trick is finding a bank whose issues you can live with.
I opened my account in henderson but for some reason this location is my "home branch."
Standard for a bank, though.
This is my go to bank because it's close to my daughter's school and it's right by my house.
I was with a different bank and they don't have locations across the us when i travel .
Other banks draw you in with promotions and freebies .
Wells fargo will offer you a cold water but way better banking .
Stay away from the wall street mega banks and put your money into a community bank like midfirst.
It's only appropriate and about time i did a review for my all time favorite banking facility.
I've had the life experience of having a bank account at basically everywhere.
From credit unions, to state banks, to other national banks!
I've gotten credit cards, car loans, countless checking and savings accounts, insurance!!
By far the best customer service, always understanding, and i have had overdrafts which i have gotten reversed!
I have just reached my 10th year anniversary with them as a my bank, and i couldn't be happier!
Never thought i would be writing a review on a bank, but great service must be recognized.
My daughter and i received exceptional customer service.
No one likes to go bank after work but it's not bad at all for me to swing by here.
I used to bank with chase right after the wamu merger.
That all changed recently when i opened a new account.
The customer service is excellent!
I have really enjoyed banking at chase and think their customer service is great.
I truly enjoyed my experience at this bank.
I cannot tell you enough how glad i was to work with biltmore loan.
Best private bank in the state of arizona.
In and out of the bank in less than 5 minutes.
They also offer nationwide free atm service, it's a must if you travel a lot like me.
And they are the home bank for arizona state university sun devils!
They let me keep my free checking/checks that i had from the wamu days.
Always friendly and helpful service.
Foreign money exchange is literally the only good currency exchange in las vegas.
Walk in with your cash money.
Walk out with your foreign cash money.
Definitely a go-to place if you ever need to exchange any money.
Amazing customer service and they took care of me and my account.
I am beyond happy with my new policy and the wonderful customer service i received from her office!
I came into this bank for some coin rolls.
Also, this place is 4% cheaper than my bank.
Great service - check better pricing - checkmate.
This is the place if you're looking to a hassle free money conversion.
Tip - if you bank at chase, cashiers check are free.
I am a current wells fargo customer- and i just wanted to stop in an open an additional savings account.
#nodapl was my reason for switching from my big bank financial institution over to a credit union.
I started my new account application online and finished it at my local branch.
Linda was the representative that wound up setting up my new accounts and she could not have been nicer!
She talked me through everything and all of the services available to me!
Great service and super friendly staff.
Mike and his team are incredibly professional and cover a wide range of services.
The best service i have ever had at a cibc.
The staff here makes a conscious effort to go above and beyond when it comes to customer service.
They truly shine in this area; their level of customer service is exceptional.
Quick and easy currency conversion and better rates than the banks.
I recently opened my account with one nevada and it has been a great experience so far.
I recommend that if you are looking to open and account, you go to him.
I don't do any personal banking here but needed help with a transaction involving a wells fargo account.
I would highly recommend her to anyone who has (or wants) a wells fargo account.
Exchange rate excellent, saved me a lot of $ in lieu of buying from my bank!
Great  bank, staff always kind and helpful.
I'm new to this bank.
This bank is so huge!!!
It has like 7-8 bank machines.
So yeah, this bank is cool.
Always a quick turnaround, very responsive, professional and provide the most exceptional cost-saving service.
Pros: this wf bank is pretty good.
They provide most of the bank services here and have 1 atm in the drive-thru!
For the most part because of a banker there named morris richie.
I have multilpe accounts and multiple questions.
No matter what banking problem i have, morris solves it.
I feel like he is my friend rather than my banker.
I go out of my way to use this bank.
What a great bank!
Excellent service and services, excellent banking plans, lovely people.
This bank treats you like a customer, not just a 'consumer.'
I'm all for regional banks and midfirst is one of the best ever.
And - wait for it - you'll get a hand-written note from them after you open an account.
Run, do not walk, to move your banking business there.
This the best bank i have ever dealt with.
I don't know about the rest of amtrust bank branches, but this one is the best one ever.
Anita is the senior personal banker at the location.
Bank of america wanted 4% higher.
This location is near several popular places and also in the same parking lot as a bank of america.
They've dug me out of a tough time or two with their positivity and great customer service!
I recently opened a checking, savings and cd with the am trust bank on rae road in chandler.
Assistant branch manager, maryann myers, personally handled the set up of my new accounts.
Absolutely the best service i have ever received in opening a new banking relationship!
Went in to this branch to convert a regular checking account in to a trust.
I waited no longer than 15 minutes and was approached by nataly to inquire why we were in the bank.
Customer service is key at this branch.
We have been with this bank/branch for many years and for good reason.
What a super service to have and without ordering and having to wait for shipment!
We will share this service and location with others and we highly recommend this place.
Crazy how much money people have.
4 stars, solid bank in my opinion
Great service and they charge so much less than all the other exchanges.
Avoid travelex, banks, and hotels.
I had read the loan terms and disclosures on their website prior to submitting the application.
I felt comfortable proceeding and we closed the loan within 10 days.
This even includes business banking.
My advice if your looking for speedy service use the atm or go to another branch.
I came in to sign up for a new bank account.
She even exchanged my random australian money i had.
Everyone there was really nice, the place is welcoming and i got good money for my jewelry.
I was greeted and taken care of right away great customer service.
Usually hate going to the bank, but this visit was enjoyable!
Not the banks fault though so i won't consider that in my review but it is super annoying.
I go to the foreign money exchange for every trip i've taken over seas.
They have the currency readily available, the service is quick, and the employees are always very kind!
Great service at this location - very friendly - you get in and out very quickly :)
It's a bank, a bank , a bank.
There are two atms in the drive through, one atm outside and then you can go in to the bank.
The only time that is inconvenient is when they close the atms to do maintenance or change the money.
Going inside the bank, the line generally goes fast.
Service is as expected and friendly.
Collin wolfson the account manager is really knowledgeable and helpful.
Lucia has excellent customer service, smiling  and asking how she can help me.
Great customer service here.
It's a bank, what can i say?
Very professional, very attentive, definitely will wait on line to see this guy for any of my banking needs!
Great online and mobile app for my everyday banking needs.
My girlfriend and i went in rather late before they closed to close an old account of hers.
Mind you this was to close an account too so they were technically losing a customer.
I'm not easily impressed with the service of banks but this really stood out.
Google said 39 they charged 41, much better than the banks.
You got most here than you would at a bank or the airport!
Best bank i have ever been into.
This is my favorite bank of all time.
I keep reminding myself to switch my other accounts to this bank as well.
I feel like the other banks keep nickel & diming me.
But i hit the jackpot with choosing this foreign money exchange ....
I exchanged a total of  $1,500 u.s. into the foreign money.
They had my currency available and the exchange rate was waaaaay better than the bank!
Fast service as expected, same as in other qts.
I opened an account and will keep going back.
This banking institution, in general, is horrible.
(in my opinion) i've banked with them for years, and the fees are ridiculous.
I have slowly been trying to change everything over to another bank.
Somewhere that doesn't charge me fees to access my money.
Usual bank business, not as busy since it's in "southern islands" ha haa
Service is usually slow but very friendly.
I had to stand in line to get checked in and then wait again for service.
I read the reviews & went over to open an account yesterday.
I am so angry with bank of america that i have been with for the past five years.
The prices are good, and the service to get any information you may need along the way is great.
A service up to my expectations!
As a longtime tdct client, i can't complain about the prompt service, but this branch lacks a human touch.
Tellers and bankers were all very helpful
Jordan thomson is the best banker i have ever encountered!!!
I'm forever grateful and will remain a bank of america customer because of him
They do 2nd chance banking with helps someone like me get back on my feet.
It beats waiting in the banks for your money to come and they will not rip you off.
I just applied for and got a loan to consolidate my debt and have some windows replaced.
Chase is a pretty good bank overall.
The bankers treat you really well and are professional and courteous.
Love their app that even lets you deposit checks without going to the bank.
I went to the bank around closing to deposit a large check.
I made the mistake of using a computer to do my banking, atms, who needs them?
It's always a nice surprise when you are able to save money when switching.
Her name is margaret (maggie) flanagan, and she is a personal banker at this branch.
She is worth the drive or call in order to navigate other than superficial banking needs.
I didn't open all the coin rolls at the bank, but i did when i got home later that day.
I realized i was shorted, but i didn't have time to go into the bank until just today...
Outside of signing loan papers or robbing it, when was the last time that you ventured into a bank branch?
Because of its location, i can understand why they have so many bank machines available and a large teller space.
I had fraudulent charges on my account two days before i was set to leave town.
I've banked at other banks before but he made me feel welcome and talked to me like an actual person.
Not like another banker who hates his job.
On top of that, recently one banker made the greatest impression on me.
Unfortunately, this has to be debited directly out of her account.
So i just told my mom i would give her the money for her to apply to her account.
I think i need to make this my primary bank!
Been banking with chase bank for like forever.
Enjoyed their fast service and friendly staffs.
Great location, great service, everyone is very friendly and helpful.
It's my go to branch for all my simple easy to do banking needs.
I receive fine service every time i come here.
There is no language barrier and i am always treated with the utmost care when i bank here.
I have been a member of this bank for 6+ years after converting from satan's lair (bofa).
They are incredible as a banking establishment.
The customer service at this branch is phenomenal.
It is a lot of small touches that make this bank a standout.
Even the safe deposit box area feels better than most banks.
I would highly recommend this particular branch of midfirst bank!
It is rare to have a personal touch at banks today.
Every major bank claims to have a personal banker.
I came in today for a quick bit of banking.
I do like to save money though.
I met with michelle b who is a personal banker.
Just changed money here again for a trip to china.
Apparently, anyone who disagrees does not travel or change money often.
Each person i've had the pleasure of assisting me is so friendly, pleasant, and provide excellent service.
But here the girls nice and serve donuts i love this bank here i drive father from scottsdale come here.
You guys rock pretty sad got drive to another city for good service.
Check out cardinal community credit union, they are way better than any bank out there!
Dane county credit union has been my financial institution since i opened my account when i was 15.
I really appreciate all of the e-services they have, including the ebanking and especially the chat feature on their website.
I lost my bank card and was lost on how to pay my bills.
Everything was linked to my bank card.
Whom was very patient and showed me how to do the online banking or bill pay.
The moment i walk into this bank, someone is always asking me how they can help me.
This place is great, good rates, fast service and friendly!
Ive been banking here for quite some time and never had any issues.
I handled my personal and business accounts and if there were any questions they were always answered.
As i compute it, that is a spread over interbank rate of about 1.7%.
Elaine wynn banks here.
Floyd mayweather banks here.
George maloof banks here.
I probably step foot into a bank three times per year.
The notary service was free.
Joe bryant williams was my loan officer who gave exceptional customer service.
Joe found a way to offer me the options i needed with a refi/cashout loan.
You are loan officer extraordinaire!
Ill be banking here for a longtime when i visit vegas.
Great customer service and very knowledgeable.
Recently switched banks and daniel was super nice and friendly to me.
That was appreciated thanks again you will be seeing me soon when i come in to make my savings account!
Excellent customer service and great rates on loans as well as savings/checking accounts have made me a believer.
We switched all of our accounts over about 2 years ago, and i am so glad we did!
The bank itself is good though
Tracy & jessica are awesome did everything to help me with things i needed help with our bank accounts.
The ladies at the counter was very helpful and all are so polite at this bank
The only place i go for money exchange.
The rate is better than the bank.
Nikki and susan are the employees i've contacted the most and they give superior customer service!
Otherwise, this location has never given any bad services or issues.
After doing some research and checking a few major banks, i decided to give this place a try.
Make sure you have an idea of what the foreign money should look and feel like before you head in.
Australian money is plastic and very colorful!
I highly recommend this place for any money exchanges and if you have foreign money left over, don't worry!
Reason i'm leaving a review for this bank is because i left bank of america.
I hate it that bank and i finally found a bank that has great customer service and fast lines.
Bank of america and i'm never looking back.
As a small business owner i usually look at most banks as evil.
We got the lowest rates for our merchant services accounts and really like their online banking.
As far as demon bankers go, i have to say that our experience at this branch has been great.
Use too bank here a long time ago and i decided to come back
Friendly teller service inside.
Chase seems to be on point with providing good customer service.
I spend a lot of money in their austin, tx store.
I've always had a great experience at citibank.
Needed a quick loan and mario was great!
I would recommend them to anyone who needs a loan .
Fast prompt service perfect atmosphere and received results was after
I feel like every time i go, and i go a lot, i'm accosted by someone and asked for money.
My favorite bank, fast, efficient, and courteous service!
Banking doesn't get any better than this!
I came here with my husband to settle an estate account.
We had great service from the managers.
As always say, customer service is so important.
I have my boa account open in california.
So i decided, i still have to go to a real bank.
Even just for a minute so the bank tellers don't have to stress and the long line.
I have been banking with citibank for over 10 years and love it!
I found an issue with one of my accounts, went in on 11/28/17, and the issue was fixed!
I have always received good service here and i am always greeted.
Service can be slow but generally good customer awareness.
I'm a little surprised by the poor reviews of this branch of citibank.
As far as big banks go, citibank is not the worst, by far.
Love this bank, the tellers and the loan officer.
Visited this location over the weekend to open a checking account and i had an amazing experience.
Happy they keep a notary service.
Many chase locations have quit this service- hate chase but this is a good branch
The customer service rocks in this place.
I opened account there only because my paychecks come from there and that its across the street from my apt.
Melissa renda provided outstanding service and has been prompt and responsive.
My mom needed to exchange some money for her trip to europe and yelp did not disappoint.
They even take whatever money you have left over to exchange back to dollars.
Very efficient and friendly service!
The best bank in us.
A very convenient chinatown bank
This bank has been here for a while now.
They are really big on customer service here.
They are quick and very efficent, they always thank you for banking here.
Nice place, and a good bank.
Professional and attentive service.
It's more like a credit union atmosphere, but with big bank services and convenience.
Clean and quiet bank.
Great service, good value and fantastic people.
They're always cheerful & helpful so i enjoy the service i receive.
I always go inside the bank so i can work with a regular teller.
I've been their customer for over 2 years and have always enjoyed my service and premiums!
We're from out of town and don't have midfirst bank there.
We needed to withdraw a large amount of cash, but our bank doesn't have branches open on the weekend.
Midfirst bank saved the day!
If we had a midfirst bank branch in our hometown, i would seriously consider switching.
I was here yesterday and was so impressed with the customer service.
I brought my 81 year old mother in to open an account.
There isn't much customer service around these days, but he was amazing!!!
I would recommend this bank to anyone.
However, closed on weekends n customer service ends with business day times.
And more folks here are waiting to talk to someone at a desk than any other bank i've ever been.
You know it's making tons of money for them.
She is very informative and her service is always on point.
(see pics)  not a cool situation if you're counting a lot of money on the counter.
He gave me great advise and offered his services with my financial situation.
The service i recieved from these two individuals was 5 stars and 2 thumbs up.
Great products and great customer service will always keep me a member.
I will definately continue to bank with one nevada credit union and recommend this institution to everyone.
Matt was a dream to sit next to for an hour while setting up my account.
He helped me get my business account up and running smoothly!
Super grateful for this chase bank experience
Not because it's safeway, but because they have longer banking hours than typical.
Over the top customer service!
I had an issue with a client who banked with bofa.
I want to especially thank jasmine s. and matt d. for their exceptional customer service.
When it comes time for me to open any new accounts, etc.
As a coldwell banker real estate professional i amvery cautious about the services i refer my clients to.
Now a month later we are closing on our house and needed home owners quickly for our loan.
I can't say enough about this bank and this branch.
David - one of the personal bankers is amazing.
Helpful, personable and even made opening an account for my kids an educational and fun experience.
Truly a community bank with a personal focus.
I already feel great about my decision to open my account with this branch.
I don't use the foreign currency exchange services at this location anymore and here's why.
They are first a loan, jewelry and pawn company, but they are also experts in dispersing estate items.
Great place to exchange money before leaving for an international trip!
Although this place is a little difficult to find, once there they provide fast and friendly service.
Each of the times i've been in this location, i've experienced great service.
I love this bank, they have never given me a hassle  about any thing.
Meh, its a bank.
I began to deal with wells fargo because my girl scout troop banks there.
When told we were in limbo because we had just ordered new checks and hated to waste that money.
I look forward to banking here.
Our loan rate changed from our initial conversation and i've read that many felt they were deceived, we were not.
I have accounts at both chase and wells fargo.
I appreciate their friendliness and great customer service and will bank here for a long time to come.
Thanks to my visit at the bank today, my 3 year old daughter now owns coins from elvis presley's hay-day.
Service was excellent and the staff was really friendly
This has been my bank for years, it only gets better as the members increase.
There's atms everywhere, few charges, free checking and best of all online check deposit.
Being a client with the cathay bank for 3 years since it opens at vegas.
I really appreciate their excellent services.
Ms. nissha is very warm , precise, patiently answers every question we asked about our business account.
I opened my both saving and checking account with cathay bank since they have such  good services.
I still refer my friends and co-workers to  open  accounts with the bank.
I just want to say thanks for their dedicated services.
I have received excellent service from the staff here.
I really thought mr. basha took very good care of me and my accounts.
Their cars are amazing and the service is amazing!!!!
Great service each and every time!!
The service is great, which makes up for their understaffed team.
Not the bank i frequent, but definitely helpful since its the closest to home!
This bank gets a total of five stars from me.
I've banked all over town and this bank is by far the best in customer service and bank fees.
The location is a bit out of the way but they do offer a great option for online banking.
The bank is just off the 215 on west russell and has a large parking lot.
Scott was excellent in getting out loan approved.
I love how the 24 hour atm service has the cash deposits built in.
This is a great convenience for tipped employees being we carry so much cash to the bank all the time.
The staff are friendly, professional and love the ability to park in front of the bank.
I went inside once last year and the staff was friendly and the bank was clean.
Your customer service skills need help.
I'll be back on saturday to close our account.
I absolutely love this bank location -- why?
Cuz david cruz is the most amazing banker everrr!!!
Exceptional customer service and goes above and beyond to help.
Best service i ever received at a financial institution.
When i had to meet with a banker he was personable & very helpful!
Not a lot of other big bank branches in the immediate area.
Opened a new account in less than 30 minutes.
Comes with amazing benefits such as retirement accounts and good loan rates for a new car or house.
The bankers at cathay bank are very friendly and efficient.
We came here for a wire transfer to escrow, and the bankers here offered very professional help.
Omg anyway, i couldn't thanks cathay bank more for their excellent service.
Their banker, kevin even give me a good follow up the next day.
I would recommend this bank to my clients.
Had a great experience with holly making my banking quick and easy!!
Made my day and it's rare to get great customer service these days but this bank has it down!
She is a huge asset to this bank.
I'm always going to prefer a credit union over a traditional bank.
I recently needed to apply for a car loan and my first thought was to go through my credit union.
So i purchased a car, went back to the bank to sign the purchase and finance paperwork.
I'm hardly paying any money towards interest.
My bank wants to put a hold on it, understandable, but i need the money now.
So, i have to find a bank of america.
Bank of america, the employees at this location are saints.
They saved my life, or at least my gpa as that money went  towards desperately needed school books.
He and walked me through my business account and what i needed.
Then, he contacted the other departments to help get me set up with insurance and a merchant account.
Taylor is the personal banker assisted me today.
As a note this branch is inside albertsons but it had a teller and banking areas.
I use bank of america as a business account not a personal account.
Not so thrilled when it comes to personal accounts though considering their past history.
My husband held a personal account for a while but was quick to close it down
The bank is nice.
I have been banking here for a few years now, and i love it!
The problem is desert school's online banking!
It's so frustrating that i might actually switch banks.
It says online banking is temporarily unavailable... every.
Figure it out already desert schools, you're losing customers because you can't do what every other bank is doing successfully!
I set up my first ever credit card with chase bank on their unlimited freedom card.
The level of service, competitiveness of rates and ease of communication is genuinely outstanding.
Been coming to this bank for about 4 years.
Superior customer service and would definitely use them again!
After finding service fees for my 40+ year checking account i called the 800 # for wells fargo.
I was not pleased with the service on the phone so decided to walk into the branch on n. durango.
I am getting away from bank of america.
I opened a checking account and found out i will not have to pay fees.
Never ask if i want to open an account or the usual sales stuff.
Great bank, i recommend it to everyone needing a bank.
Good service - but - and it's a big one...
You want your money in a federal credit union (not banks) when the banking collapse occurs fairly soon.
Your money will be safe there.
Helped me quickly get a replacement bank card when mine came up missing.
They have always made sure that all of my accounts that i have are meeting my needs still.
I have a lot accounts due to a company that i own.
No troubles with this lorain national bank location.
He had great customer service and got us sat down and out in less than 5 minutes.
Today i went to the bank to pay off a bank loan.
I also noticed that he personally greeted every customer that walked into the bank.
Thanks again for the great customer service.
Clean, nice bankers, no wait and friendly.
I think at all wells fargo banks they have great customer service.
I have been banking here for my business since 2014.
They got my online business account access fixed.
Hope we can keep this small bank relationship in the big bank world.
****  four years ago, i refinanced with the very big bank that's been in the news.
I felt hassled and beleaguered right up until the loan was approved.
My closing costs for this loan really and truly amounted to $295*.
In recent years they have expanded their mortgage loan program to other states, including mine.
She has saved me money on car insurance, home owners insurance, life insurance, and renter's insurance.
Today, years later, i am able to call up her team and get the best service anytime, day or night.
They didn't pocket the money.
But then later found out the dealer ship went to another bank with out me knowing about.
One of the bankers called me to inform me the application wasn't with desert school.
The interest rate was 3.2% with the other bank.
I am an accountant and i have been in canada for more than 30 years.
I recommend this bank to my friends and family.
I hate having to go into the bank to stand in line to do my banking.
And i don't like spending what little time i do have waiting at the bank.
Normally i would be disappointed but it's okay when we're talking about banks.
Anyways, banking here has always been a joy.
Just opened an account with wells fargo and had an excellent experience.
They answered all my questions and made the process of setting up a new account extremely easy.
Talk about great customer service!!!
The customer service here is outstanding!!
I come here to use the shared branch services; as im from down south!!!
I receive the best service at this location, especially from eddie,the assistant manager.
These are beautiful people and they give great service.
This is the service that i know about wells fargo.
So glad we quit bofa and switched to a smaller bank that cares.
Midfirst bank is what banks used to be back in the day.
We have hardly any bank frees and atm fees charged by other banks are reimbursed to our account.
We've had nothing short of amazing service with this company.
They have made all 3 loans i have had through them a very quick and easy process.
I really like this bank, my only negative is the lack of bank locations.
A completely serviceable branch in bloomfield.
Also, unlike the other major banks, u.s. bank still has good (and affordable) checking services.
*one caveat: the 1-800 call center for u.s. bank is extremely rude and unhelpful.
We always stop at this chase bank on saturday mornings during our walk around the farmers market.
5 stars, capitol chase bank rocks!
Wow thats what i call customer service!!
Though not open on sundays, for sunday banking go visit the branch at mccowan and bullock!
I've been recently making account deposits for work at this bank.
Bank tellers are always friendly and welcoming!
There are three bank tellers in their lobby and two drive-thru lanes outside.
If i didn't already do my personal banking elsewhere, i'd gladly open an account here.
However service inside the bank is professional and friendly for the most part.
Kinda sorta like a small town bank feel at times which is pretty awesome.
One nevada credit union and financial service representative dawn craig, awesome!!!!
I transferred all of my accounts from chase, which offers poor customer service at most local branches.
As always, the employees were cheerful, courteous, and didn't try to offer you any unneed services.
Nothing worse than going to the bank and spending 20 - 30 minutes in line .
Not only is she beautiful, but she'll save or make you a lot of money.
They were able to close my loan 20 days faster than other lenders.
5 star service all the way!
Wanted to thank edina for helping me take of a fee i had on my account.
So i've had account with this bank for what seems forever!!
Stay tuned for more because the call center customer service might change this review.
The parking is kinda horrid but the service is great.
I love this bank (and this particular location.)
They're always so helpful and professional and i've never had a problem with them unlike other banks i've dealt with.
The banker possibly the branch manager there was wonderful.
I have been with this bank since 1998 and have never exerienced any problems.
If you need a solid bank with very competent employees try wells fargo.
He asked me a couple questions and before i knew it i had a checking and savings account.
Bank of america no longer allows a chashiers check to be made out to a p.o.
Let me preface this story with a few facts: boyfriend and i are money idiots.
I currently have three banks: wells fargo, desert schools, and chase.
I haven't been to this bank on the weekends because it is by my work.
I went in because my account was negative $300 and i was not the one who did it.
I was pointed to a banker joey who was amazing.
He talked to the fraud department for me set up my new bank account and made everything smooth and payment.
They were even able to get me my stolen money back using the banks fraud insurance thing.
Its saturday morning and the bank is out of quarters.
Question to self and employees is this is a bank correct?
I stopped into see erin, who is a business banker, for a quick notary today.
Actual bank is on first floor of high rise on central.
Bank of a long ass wait?
I say b of a...bank of america!
They were also very accommodating with my service dog who was with me.
Deposited a cheque and then went downstairs to longos to spend my money.
I have been banking with them for over two years, they have been very helpful maintaining my account.
The service is excellent, along with very friendly people.
That being said they are some of the nicest banking industry people i have ever had to deal with.
My teller was the utmost in knowledge and customer service.
Overall wells is a great bank and i am very proud of being in business with him.
Truely fantastic service i've had with them.
I had an issue with a money order that required a stop pay and reissue.
Perfect banking location right off the freeway.
I am so pleased with this bank.
I'm so happy i closed my b of a account and switched to these guys.
Its been almost a year since opening my nbaz account and life is good.
These guys provide real personal service.
It varies vendor to vendor, and not 100% under the bank's control.
I would definitely recommend this bank to anyone who asked.
One of the appealing things that originally brought me here was their low direct deposit requirement to waive bank fees.
Awesome friendly service every time i go in for my banking needs!
Never have had any problems banking at this location.
This rbc branch has a bank concierge, and she remembered my name the next day.
Never had any problems with this bank like i have with other banks in the past.
Open your account here!
Always great service !
They don't give free money lol but it helps to know the right people
I hate going to the bank but these employees make it not so bad.
I think this is actually the best banking experience i've ever had.
I've never had any negative account issues.
Good location as far as banks go.
See luz as an account manager.
Went in today to do the job i hate the most each month-wire money into my loan at home.
Yvonne gave me excellent service and went above and beyond to make sure all my needs were met.
What else can you say about a bank?
I am back and the only difference is that i got even better service this time!
Btw: brittany singh (personal banker) helped me and she was amazing!
I have found the customer service to be friendly and helpful.
I give our loan originator, mr. ariel jessop with peoples mortgage in salt lake city.
Having ariel jessop doing our loan, with on time closing and contingencies shorter than usual.
I guess their service makes up for the ridiculous service fees.
Vibe  think of a bank.
My teller told me about the e-savings account that i can withdraw from at any time without charge.
But now my savings are automated and i learned some new stuff along the way.
But seriously, lovely lovely service here.
I love love love this bank!!!
Thank you alex and rana for being such great bankers.
I'll never ever leave this bank!!
One of the last great banks around.
We recently moved to the buckeye area from out of state and needed a new bank.
We looked around and decided on us bank.
Within a few minutes a young lady named dalila helped us open our account and we were on our way.
Everything i've had to go into the bank to do has been a pleasant experience.
So, i'm giving layal and her branch five stars for the excellent service and experience i received.
I hate dealing with banks.
I cannot stress this enough i hate dealing with banks.
But at least this bank has a great manager brendon anytime i have a issue he resolves it fast.
This location has the best customer service.
Excellent service....happy to help.
This is a busy bank and there is alway a line and people waiting in the lobby.
This location need more personal bank tellers to help customers.
There were three bank tellers wearing the blue shirt uniform with one manager supervising (new trainees?).
Speedy trip to the bank- nice & easy.
Formerly wamu, there are so many locations of chase bank throughout the city and beyond.
They take pride in taking care of their customers and making sure to give fast and courteous service.
The service is friendly and the locations are convenient there is  a branch in most cities in northeast ohio.
I'm a little old fashioned when it comes to my money.
I still go into the bank to get money and cash checks.
I recommend third federal to anyone looking for good service from a responsible bank without a bunch of silly fees.
This is my bank, this is the only one i'll go to in tempe.
This guy has taken care of me and really saved me money.
I got out of a bad contract with another bank and they really helped me out.
Very small bank that does not have a large amount of traffic.
It is one of the friendliest neighborhood banks in the valley.
I now know more about the services bofa has to offer and a new friend.
Thank you amerifirst and karen moon/team for restoring my faith in the mortgage loan process.
I rarely write online reviews but i am very impressed with the customer service at this office.
What can i say...its a bank.
People are always freindly and they give me my money when i need it.
The big banks claim to care, but in fact you know they could care less.
The bank itself is usually very slow.
Being in texas i had to send an auto loan check to hold the car.
It's a bank with a drive up atm - what more can i say?
I've never been inside this place - i never go inside banks really anymore.
Excellent and outstanding service from everyone in the branch.
The service my husband and i received from christina crabtree and peoples mortgage company was amazing.
I am very happy with this bank.
Customer service is a top priority the people that work there are knowledgeable and friendly.
But most of all the service dept.
I am so glad that i opened an account at this credit union!
Their customer service was great as well as their follow up!
We had both of the loans done in less than a week signed and checks mailed out !
I was going to setup a business account with chase and his mansplaining was terrible.
I went saturday to transfer money from my chase rewards/chase freedom credit card.
Only 2 bankers on duty, while the cubicles were empty.
A lady helped me out by dialing the number to transfer the money to my checking account.
I have a business account with this bank and we keep it here because of her.
It's refreshing to deal with her each and everytime i come to the bank.
She is a great face for the bank.
She's wonderful and this bank needs more employees like her.
There was always a live customer service rep available during business hours.
What a great surprise stumbling across this bank!
I opened both a savings and checking account here.
In fact, if you use a non-midfirst bank atm, they will refund you the service fees.
How refreshing with the current state of banking.
Was never treated this way at chase and she made me feel appreciated for bringing my business to us bank.
Highly recommend this us bank branch and amber the personal banker.
They even helped me with a vehicle loan & 401k rollover from a previous job.
I received most excellent customerservice here - and im not even a customer!
If i decide to get a bank account, itll probably be here.
Ive been banking with wells fargo since 1996 and i've some minor problems but not much.
I prefer banks that when you go in they know you.
My husband and i opened a checking account with them today.
Shauna was the banker that set up our account.
The service is always fast and the employees are very friendly.
I hope this bank never changes!
I have had to ask for many notary services and various complicated requests while trying to settle my brother's estate.
Kristin petersen and juan galindo have been especially helpful and have gone to extra lengths in customer service.
I'm a new wells fargo customer and was trying to get my account going today.
Jennifer rivera (banker) was so helpful and friendly in helping me with my needs.
At least it's all over with and i'm now all good to go with my checking account.
Overall service was okay.
Was looking for a new bank that is available everyday and closes later than all the other banks.
It will show on your account initially, but after it officially goes through the fee is taken out.
So overall i really like this bank.
This is technically my banking location.
Now my account is actually set up for atm use only.
It just seems like banks have done away with the personal touches that used to be commonplace.
Just wish banking was more personal like the old days so i could rate my experience higher.
I like this cibc as it is conveniently located in bayview village and has an entrance leading to the bank.
It is never overrun, so you can get your day to day banking done without having to wait.
Thy definitely have wonderful customer service
As a business owner, a good working relationship with your bank is key.
Went through the drive through today for the first time, fast service.
Would go back if i ever needed a bank close to me to use.
This is review is for 'those 2 loan guys', david butcher and albie anderman..and their awesome assistant lacy!
If you're looking for insurance, vehicle loans/mortgages or even investing options - call this place!
I've had an account with arizona central credit union for years and i love them.
They have excellent customer service and low fees.
Since i've started going back here on a regular basis i havent been pressured into opening up another account.
First of all this bank is very close to my home.
This is the only bank i have  ever seen do this.
Extra parking in bank.
Transferring money takes seconds.
They have great rates on loans for members and many quality services, which should really be called 'conveniences'.
I have banked there for years and will continue to so.
Good service at every branch i've visited (wt harris, sunset, huntersville, central avenue).
This is the best bank i've ever had.
Great bank for my business account.
Ya the cheques take forever - but the cheque company is d&h which isn't scotiabank.
That's just what happens at any bank when you deposit a cheque from a different country.
He's cool, sharp, and actually cares about my accounts.
I've tried other banks, and so far i'm sticking with scotiabank.
Overall service was okay, but i waited for about 10 minutes before i was helped.
The staff is extremely friendly and will ensure that you're satisfied with the services they provide.
I have multiple accounts and they are very polite and helpful with all of my questions and banking needs.
The best loan service i've ever experienced.
In this era of loan complexities and hoops to jump through, peoples mortgage, specifically shelley williams, were outstanding.
Chad s. was great with taking care of my banking in a super fast manner.
Ricky khamis did an amazing job of educating my buyers and keeping the loan on track throughout the whole process.
Definitely impressed with the customer service.. thank you joanna morris .
I've had multiple loans with this institution, and wouldn't consider looking elsewhere.
This company has specialized in residential mortgage loans for decades, and it shows in their service level.
Mark helped me set up my new account.
This is a newer bank of america branch, conveniently located off of i-17 and bell.
There are drive thru and walk up atm's, and the customer service is excellent.
Lines can be long, but service is always great there.
We've been happy with the service overall.
The personal bankers here are all great though!
My wife and adult son moved their accounts there as well.
They provide personal attention and take care of my banking needs very well (so far).
I do most of my banking online.
Fees for accounts and services are free or very low.
My banking needs are pretty simple and the size of cicu is a great fit for me.
If you are shopping for a place to do your banking pay them a visit!
There are only a few things i expect from a bank:  - keep the lines moving.
As with many businesses in greenfield - chain or local - the service and friendliness is top notch.
On saturday, i needed to deposit some money in my chequing account and decided to pay this location a visit.
Both the gentleman and i did our banking there, along with an existing customer pressing away at the screen.
Top notch customer service!
The best bank in town.
The bankers truly​ go above and beyond to take good care of their customers.
Helpful customer service folks and even extra people on duty when the atm was down.
If only the real estate aspect of chase was as good as the banking side.
I love banking here.. going to be moving a car loan over here..
I treat this as my home td branch and have opened several accounts here.
Awesome bank in a safeway.
Good customer service everytime i come here.
Not just a bank it's a building that has suites with different business.
Service is great they'll take the extra 2 seconds to recommend something like they are supposed to.
Use common sense of course a bank will be busy when everybody is getting off work for the day
This bank has been ok over the years.
Each time i have had to go back at least once because something was wrong with each account.
I asked the bank about it and they dont know.
The bank says it's the credit card who put it on there.
In summary, the bank is ok but the customer service is poor.
Amazing service start to finish.
Brandon and his team closed out loan in less than 30 days.
Easy to dispute fraud if it happens, cards are delivered quick, and great rates for car loans that i've needed.
It took over two months for my loan to close.
-- their "smart loans" with rate re-locks just work!
For them to truly get the extra half star, they'll need to allow me to manage my loan online!
I'll be honest, i hate going to the bank.
But as far as banks go, this place is top notch.
The service is always a step above.
If you have to bank (and we all do), you might as well bank here.
She chatted happily with me while she was opening my account and the time flew.
This is our go-to bank whenever we eat at the nearby chipotle/etc.
The customer service at wells fargo continues to amaze me.
I was asked if i need help from a banker.
I've completely converted from the credit union to wf for my banking needs.
The customer service can't be beat!
It's amazing what satisfaction you can experience when you understand the rules of banking and loans and actually follow them.
I came in to refinance my house and had great friendly service even for a huge banking institution.
The building has a very interesting modern look which is not typical of a banking institution.
The bankers can be hit or miss.
I love christina's review, but wanted to add that the bank is inside of a grocery store.
Thank you for all your years of service
Easy banking for our business checking.
Such a breath air to receive great customer service on a day when everything else is going wrong.
But.. bank of america is trying to force costumers out of the branch and onto the app.
Everyone is friendly, courteous, and knowledgeable about the services that they can offer.
Gordon phong the last bank manager was great, really nice, and easy going.
We have several accounts with this bank and have always referred our business and friends over.
They also have a decent loan program for home mortgages but the process time is the same for most banks.
So if you ever want to open up a td bank account, then come here and bank with derek ng.
He will guarantee your banking satisfaction and is a very honest and reliable person.
Quick service and helpful staff on a monday.
But going to this branch has given me faith in the banking industry
This branch is always very professional from their tellers to bankers.
Everyone seems to be educated on the services they are to provide.
Highly recommend scott wiley's services.
Always on top of our loan and closed on time.
This bank is all over so you can hit the atm and more easily track your withdrawals.
This has saved me money on several occasions.
In checking acct or 5000$ combined w savings and checking.
My husband and i were provided banking services by mark delacruz.
We were treated promptly, kindly and expediently to handle our banking needs.
I would recommend mark due to his extraordinary knowledge and overall customer service in handling our banking needs.
Ive been to other banks in the area and most of them stink.
This one was very friendly in large part due to the customer service rep, shauna.
Just opened up a checking and savings account online.
Didn't think i would be able to get an account at all.
The process was quick and he was just flat out awesome with customer service.
But with this kind of service it's worth the wait.
Without going into all my banking details.
Alex s. provides great customer service and as a man of his word.
Without going into all my banking details.
Alex s. provides great customer service and is a man of his word.thank you alex for being such great banker.
I love love love this bank!!!
I'll never ever leave this bank!!
Thanks for being there for all my banking needs ladies.
They hold my money so that's good.
I have had a banking relationship with stearns bank for years.
I have nothing but good things to say about the bank.
Even though john mistler is no longer with the bank, i worked with him on many occasions.
The current banking staff are polite, professional and there to help the customer.
It is the way banking should be!
Equipment with paramount financial services,the person who helped me in the whole process is drew kabo.
If you want white glove service with the best rates look here first.
Their service department was really awesome.
Mike c gave great customer service and along with jose, they were both very helpful and attentive.
Kudos to meryem, charlie, and dave for the best car service i have ever experienced.
I have had good customer service here from the tellers the couple times i've been here.
I spent a little over two years working with her throughout my loan and qualifying process.
One nevada credit union and financial service representative dawn craig, awesome!!!!
I transferred all of my accounts from chase, which offers poor customer service at most local branches.
She was patient while setting up my account.
I even got my online account set up before leaving the branch.
I have honestly had nothing but exceptional service each time i've visited this branch.
Great bank great employees!
Best place, best costomer service, best finances, is   best vehicle .
We know that a loan/escrow process is a trying time for everyone concerned, namely the loan officer and the applicants.
This is the best bank in town.
The customer service is incredible.
I've called numerous times about different things and always gotten great customer service.
Great location, top notch service and products.
Lines move quickly and you can also get assistance with applying for a home loan and credit cards.
Key bank is great!
Their silver mm account pays atm fees and more.
If you have a job, keybank's benefits are great.
Atm available as well as full service during open hours.
I went in to the bank today to cash a check from an out of town friend.
Thank you, bobbie haley, for the friendliest service i've received at a bank in a long time.
Good bank to put your monies in.
It provided awesome customer service and i was being greatly very well.
I am in the process of switching from skank of america so i opened an account here.
A very refreshing banking experience
I think i have finally found my 'home' with a bank.
- awesome savings plans.
Negatives: - you have to have your account number (not your debit card number) when you call.
I won't name the bank but they were opening customer accounts without the customer's knowledge.
I get exceptionally friendly and knowledgeable service.
We have bought 2 cars from this place and their service is great!
When i was exploring an equity loan (time to replace windows), i did a lot of online research.
Citibank's rates were ridiculously high, and the second tier lenders all had mixed reviews.
Absolutely love chase bank!
I've been in the bank on three separate occasions in the last two weeks and mario exceeded my expectations.
Good job chase keep up the great customer service.
There was a very professional greeting when we entered, and was shown to a personal banker right away.
Our personal banker was again, professional and was able to take care of our needs promptly.
I've been a cmcu customer for about a year now and could not be happier with the service.
I will never do business again with a traditional bank.
We have been with azccu for over 16 years and have ultimately been satisfied with the service.
Definitely a more personalized experience than some larger banks.
We have had several auto loans with them and very happy with the low interest rates.
The process of the getting a home equity loan was lengthy but eventually it was approved.
Fortunately, the house did appraise high enough to allow me to get the loan.
Even though i didn't find the car i was looking for on this trip, i'd recommend checking this place out.
The bank tellers are extremely friendly and although they work efficiently, i never feel rushed.
Second, just deposit my money.
I'm really fed up with busey's questionable and inconsistent customer service.
He doesn't ruin the good customer service experience i have had at busey.
Busey is a good place to bank, with tons of atms all over champaign.
Very happy with my loan officer ryan.
Friendly and fast service.
Thank you for the excellent customer service!
Despite a snag in the appraisal process, justin's team managed to close our loan on time.
So up until today, i had always gotten top notch, perfect customer service.
I was kept notified of all aspects of the loan and what was coming up next.
I couldn't get any help from the loan company or chase customer service on the phone.
He has talked to countless people from chase and and the loan company to find where my money is.
Also chase is probably the best bank you can bank with.
I am in the loan signing business.
This office has great customer service.
If you bank with chase, you receive complimentary notary services, and that was delivered without a hassle.
This team was amazing and did an outstanding job communicating throughout our loan process!!
This is where i do all of my banking.
The tellers and bankers at this location are friendly and helpful.
The personal banker was willing to answer all his questions and walk him through the paperwork.
I would definitely recommend ryan cramer at movement mortgage and their in-house underwriting service.
They simply evaluate the house for the bank.
They just have to get the pay off for the old loan and get the title work in order.
Excellent service from bianca of 1st ave wf.
After moving, i needed to switch banks as my old one didn't have a branch in az.
Thanks, ryan, you saved us a bunch of money!
I don't typically go to the bank unless it's to the drive thru atm.
Her customer service and people skills were above and beyond.
Because cls partners with azfcu, the loan paperwork was a breeze.
A very close friend of mine banks at abt-arizona bank and trust.
The customer service at this location is the best!
Easiest time i've ever had opening an account.
I love this bank!
We come here almost everyday for our business service.
But we have never had any problem w their customer service.
I've been a member 12 years and they always provide great service with low loan rates.
How in the world does your 24-hour atm have a "service temporarily unavailable" sign for cash deposits?!?!?
I've called customer service and all they can tell me is that it's in the process of being fixed.
Wish interest paid was better, but over all a great bank and on line service.
I think this bank is great for the most part.
I pay many of my bills, send and receive e-transfers, and earn interest on my money.
Shout out to tom walker in investments and the personal bankers.
I tell everyone i know they're wasting their time and money if they're not buying a vehicle this way.
This is my local branch and i have had nothing but good service whenever needed.
The bank peoplw here have a strong sense of hospitality which is friggin awesome!!
I recommend blanca ramirez as she helped me with a car loan.
Best bank ever & vanessa is awesome super nice !
Ask for her when you go in she'll give you great service !
Thanks for the that- resorts a little hope in big banks!
Getting a new account here was quick and easy.
I had a personalized card printed and an online banking account set up during my visit.
My only issue is the apparent lag in updating your account balance in real time.
I recently opened up a couple of accounts for my business at this branch with chris morris, the branch manager.
I really don't understand why banks feel like you've walked into a monastery.
I always use the atm for all my banking needs.
When i have been inside to speak with a personal banker, i have never seen lines though!
I have been a member for over 20 years and in general they have provided very good service.
Thank you us bank for being better than the other big names!!
This branch has the greatest customer service.
From my personal accounts to my business accounts the staff here goes out of their way to be helpful.
I highly recommend this branch for great personal service.
She works hard to close any car loan and goes above and beyond .
Very good customer service here and very fast at completing the transactions.
She quickly got us signed up, and even mentioned some great benefits to having an account with us bank.
Very happy with us bank, particularly this branch.
My boyfriend and i opened a one checking rewards account tonight with suzie drinkwine.
There are no hidden fees like other banks have.
I wish all banks and credit unions across the country were warm and friendly as the staff at nellis afb!!!
The service was absolutely impeccable!!
A special thank you to deb flores who provided me the utmost customer service!!!
Again great service and i look forward to doing all my banking with onenevada @ nellis!
I do basic banking, i find them to be professional and efficient.
They certainly promote a no-fee banking system, and competitive interest rates.
Pcf is versatile, they offer: savings accounts, chequing accounts, interest-free accounts, gic accounts, mortgages, gics and i'm sure more.
Also, i do my banking mostly online and the site seems secure.
I have both bank accounts and a credit card with them and have had zero complaints.
All in all, very professional service and this was a great experience.
Wf is our bank of choice!
Great customer service, excellent hour, 24 hour phone line for help!
We love wf and all that they offer from personal to business services!
I have never had a problem with anything and i wouldn't bank anywhere else!
Not the banks fault, just reality.
The personal banker axiel is the best!
He always knows how to handle my banking needs.
Happy with oneaz and their services....again, they do very well for the average net-worth person.
The she told me about getting money back for using my card...
Got my car loan from this branch!
Matt is the one that helped me and so far i've gotten 2 car loans thru him.
I used to bank at pnc for my small business.
That was until they started charging me monthly service fees.
I stayed because i didn't want to change bank again.
So shop around before you pull the trigger on a loc or loan.
As soon as you walk into this beautiful bank branch you are immediately greeted with warm smiles and happy hello's.
I researched banks thoroughly before choosing this one, and i'm glad i did.
I also enjoy that this bank is local, as i try to avoid nationwide banks when possible.
If you support local banking, want comfortable service an security, then first commonwealth is ideal!
The husband had used the az fed car buying service for his 04 grand am.
This review will is based on the fabulous customer service i received from jc.
4 stars for jc and his fabulous customer service!
The cue for awaiting service with the available tellers is often very long.
Mr. hughes gave top box service.
I started banking here several years ago.
I switched banks after usbank wanted to charge me a monthly fee because i didn't want to do direct deposit.
This is a credit union so it doesn't have the many account requirements other banks do.
I also have never had errors or any problems with my accounts.
Every time i walk in this bank i feel like i visit my friends or joining a warm party.
Amazing employees, phenomenal management, superb customer service and easily accessible location!
He has worked with many of my clients post bankruptcy in helping them purchasing or refinancing their homes.
She greeted me and helped me open a checking account.
I never had this experience at my previous bank.
I got checks printed, new card, and  her service was awesome.
I came to open an account with bank of america and even got my car refinance.
The employees at this location go out of their way to give you the best service possible.
If you want the lowest rate and great customer service, roger white at one nevada credit union is your guy.
12 blissful months of earning twice as much interest as my stinky online savings accounts.
From the moment i stepped through the door, i received very attentive service.
I've had a bit of experience signing up for bank accounts, and the process was similar to most.
I haven't gotten this kind of personalized service since leaving my teeny tiny hometown in hickville, az.
Saving me soooo much money since there are no monthly fees and the rate is lower than square.
Believe or don't - your money - your choice.
He wisely left chase and said he's never been more satisfied with any bank.
It was my first time applying for an auto loan and was not familiar with the process.
Knowledgeable staff and great customer service.
I stopped in with a question about my checking & saving on the atm debit card.
Answered all my banking questions & welcomed me call or stop in at any time.
Just opened my checking account with lisa and mac.
I've been banking here since i moved to phoenix.
I have a savings and checking account from the beginning.
I had one of the best customer service experience ever!
This is banking old school style.
Everybody who works there knows my name, greets me by name, and gives me very personal service whenever i'm there.
I've also been pleased how u.s. bank has kept up with technology.
They can always help answer any questions i have concerning my accounts
All banks are rotten, learn the system folks.
Customer service is huge and that's a five star for me folks!
Their whole team put in effort to provide exceptional customer service, and i recommend them in the highest regard.
Usually very friendly customer service.
Thank you anthony manuel for a fast friendly service!
I frequent this bank often since it's right down the street from my business.
I'd drop by this bank if you're in the neighborhood.
Bank of a has eaten me alive with fees.
But im still there since i have direct deposit and ive never had a bank error with this bank.
I have a very new car loan through them, then retired very suddenly.
I cannot speak to any bankers regarding loans and that i first need to apply online.
There's no way you'll get this kind of service and attention at the "big box' banks.
A very friendly bank, the customer service is 100% always.
Charlie is my favorite teller he is my go to person at the bank .
I was provided with outstanding service, amy battin was direct, thorough, honest, compassionate, friendly and most of all knowledgeable.
1st i just moved here from hawaii, the place where service is expected.
Ok soooooo...if you want someone to open an account with your bank dont you stay to help them?
Bank environment isnt the best.
I have three automobile loans, a visa credit card, and overdraft protection with this credit union.
Terrific job and customer service.
We had an approval within 30 minutes and the loan was closed and completed the same afternoon.
This was by far the easiest and best service we ever received from a financial institution.
Our loan officer was erica cameron.
I have referred his services to coworkers and friends without any hesitation!
Then asked if i served in the military that would waive future checking account surcharge.
I opened my checking acct today.
I was very impressed with service  i received.
She  completely and clearly  walked  me through all the features and perks of my checking acct.
I would truly recommend this bank.
The best banking  experience ever !
I am still whole-heartedly happy to bank here.
Maybe i'm expecting too much but if i had my way, we'd all be banking locally.
Never have any issue with my checking or savings accts.
Thanks for the wonderful service!
Their vehicles are in very good shape and their warranty work is serviced by cna.
Excellent customer service---all the time!
Neguy, one of the many tellers at wells fargo bank, delivers a wonderful satisfying friendly service every time.
Just moved here from ky and we knew we wanted a credit union for our banking.
I've been banking at bofa for over 30 years.
Recently they did away with drive-up tellers, which was one of my favorite things about the bank, for convenience.
Bofa you need to take a customer service training course from wells fargo.
I adore this bank!
Small, personal & great customer service.
I used arizona federal credit union for my auto loan and they have an expert buyer service.
I love this bank with a passion!!!!!!!
My banking is always done perfectly and they treat me like a queen every time i go in!!!!!
Nice clean bank with friendly tellers.
I'm used to paying $3 atm fees at the club or at events, but not at a bank.
I recently switched banks because i have been unhappy with wells fargo.
He was super friendly and sat me down and started to explain all my best options with banking with them.
Working in the customer service industry myself i definitely recommend this place and the bank has been nice so far.
Bank staff is mindful and attentive.
I've not had any problems so far dealing with him and they have become my go to bank.
The bank hours could be improved upon and their look could be updated.
Standard bank of america.
Service was friendly and efficient.
We opened up multiple accounts for me and broke everything down.
Consistently horrible customer service.
Timely response and good service.
Very nice customer service too!
As a customer here for many years  my experience is the service is always friendly and professional.
Been here quite a few times and i've had nothing but excellent service.
Bankers are always pleasant, ask how your day is going and try to help you with everything you need.
I've been banking with macu for almost 3 years now.
Originally opened my account in utah.
Customer service is always so nice and so helpful.
Recently had some fraud hit my account when someone tried to make an online purchase with my debit card.
Macu customer service was on top of it right away and literally had it removed and handled within 24 hours.
I've been banking with this branch for approximately a year and half now and absolutely love this branch.
Just like their customer service everyone at this branch is extremely nice and extremely helpful.
Especially loan adviser desiree.
She helped me get a helping hand loan (bad credit loan) which cs originally had advised me to look into.
I know there's not one other bank that would approve this kind of loan.
5 star service all around highly recommended!!
My first time opening a checking and savings account was with this bank.
The service here is beyond outstanding.
I was greeted by mac, a financial service representative.
Mac introduced me to the credit builder loan and it's credit building process.
Mac was extremely helpful and i highly recommend his financial services!
They are extremely busy(something that the staff cant control) so sometimes the wait for a banker can be 30 min.
The succinct description is that our recent mortgage banking experience was legendary!
Thank you gary errecalde for the fantastic customer service!
Fast service inside the branch.
The other lane is either out of service and/or being fix.
You can get service with a smile, and without any attitude.
I have been banking with them for 4 years now.
Though i've only been to this bank once, i had a very pleasant experience.
The quality of vehicles and level of service and customer care is the same or better than it was before.
This bank has the best hours.
Customer service for the most part is awesome.
I've only come across 1 person that had mediocre service.. everyone else every other time has had exceptional customer service.
Very easy going bank.
After reading yelpers reviews, i decided to visit this branch to experience the great service myself.
I am beyond happy to have opened an account with one nevada !
I only have a student checking account here so i guess my review should be limited.
The us bank iphone app has been a life saver!

I highly recommend this place to anyone that does not have an account.
Thank you for service!
They always answer their phones quickly and have great customer service.

I went this wells fargo to update my married name on my bank card and complete a couple other things.
He was a very personable banker.
This bank isn't the closest to my house but i would go back here for my banking needs.
Everyone at the bank seemed to know what they were doing and seemed just as helpful as alex.

One of the banks im with.
She very helpful with all of my banking needs.
If you need a auto loan, new account etc.
Today was not a good day at the bank!!
There were no bank tellers to be seen!!!
Two seconds later 2 bank employees emerged from the back office!!
Not my first rodeo finding a us bank!!
I have to rethink who i bank with if these problems do not get resolved!
Just got done processing my third auto loan through one nevada and these guys are amazing.
They actually just refinanced a new car loan from a dealership at a much lower rate.
I highly recommend one nevada for anyone seeking some kind of loan in the las vegas valley
We are talking about anywhere from $2500 to $3000 which they add on to the loan amount.
Bank of america you have to do better man.
The plus side of this is the protection we have experienced relating to their debit and credit card service.
We haven't banked in a regular bank in years so i can't speak for the banks around phoenix.
If it wasn't for them our account would be no account.
Even though i check our account at least five times a week.
Just a heads up, this location does not do money orders, only cashiers checks- and only for account holders.
I have moved all over the country and have felt with many service companies.
The bankers are also very nice and ask how you're doing and everything.
Great overall, customer service!
Every one that works there are always willing to help and surprisingly remember everyone that banks there!
He was our banker and super cool!!
Great location and awesome that there's an atm drive though service.
The accountants and bankers are very polite and understanding.
Special shout out to anthony wesson for providing exceptional customer service.
I've been banking here for a long time.

As a long time banking customer of one nevada, my recent mortgage experience just solidifies my relationship with one nevada.
I saw blanca last friday to open a new account.

If your still banking at chase or wamu i highly suggest a switch you'll never be happier.
This bank is amazing.
But other then that this bank is amazing.
Not for profit financial services.
So no worries that some big bank will take over my credit union.
Great people on the personal banker side.
Represent the bank well.
One personal banker, two tellers, one preoccupied greater, and a mystical voice from behind a door.
You will get the best service.

They are the best bank i've been with and every branch is friendlier than the last.
The banking staff are very pleasant and always helpful.
They explained all of my coverage's and saved us a lot of money.
The best thing about this bank is that they make you feel like more than just another person.

I have never had an issue until this year when i had fraudulent charges on my account.
Their service has turned out to be superior any time i need them.
Well, it's a bank :) what would i do to enhance the experience?
They say money can't buy happiness, but it can!!
Stopped by this bank to get some cash for my skinny wallet, i needed lottery money.
This location was super clean, very modern and beautiful, and overall looks like any ole chase bank.
Their free coffee was definitely free if you into that stuff, and their service sucks as always.
I can't wait till robots take over bank tellers.
Overall a typical chase bank.
Great service and selection!
She is the perfect balance of insurance knowledge & customer service.
The best place hands down for home loans.
But what really makes this branch great is their bankers.
I always get so much help from jonathan- he's my personal banker.
I've bank with chase bank for 5+ years already and i really enjoy using all chase atm's.
I like that idea which it will keep non-chase customers away from the bank.
I'd change banks if this was the experience i could expect from my bank.
This bank is really from a bygone era with beautifully decorated ceilings, velvet curtains, chandeliers, beautifully designed.
Worth a special visit as anyone can enter and take a look around during normal bank hours.
Justin fliek helped me on my business account.
Great service and courteous employees.

Try their auto buying service, it is excellent as is their used car warranty plan.
I use the drive up services once a week.
She offers excellent customer service.
While i am not doing my mortgage through chase, i do bank here and needed bank statements and documents notarized.
Well, not if you bank at credit union west!
I gave up and decided to stop at one of the tons of big name banks i kept passing.
Banking with a credit union just gets easier and easier!
There is an actual bank at this location
I also had the best loan experience.
From my primary loan to my heloc.
Was with another bank before that absolutely would not work with me at all.
I needed a bank that would work with me and grow with me.
Thank you for the great customer service and going above and beyond.
I am staying with your bank.
I love this bank if only there were more valley locations.
No hidden extra charges you get with other banks.
I am not  fan of chase bank.
My personal accounts are elsewhere but i assist someone with their chase account and occasionally have to deal with them.
If you must bank with chase, you'll do ok here.
Remove the last name of this banker.
If the bank is the issue take it up with bank of america.
There is usually a wait no matter what branch you go to if you need to see a personal banker.
It's my first time opening an account at one nevada credit union.

Best of all, by banking with azstcu you are keeping your money in this state and supporting local enterprise.

Thank you margaret and one nevada for taking good care of my banking needs!!
You can see all your accounts, transfer funds within, and your balance increase and decrease exactly with each transaction.
Second, all the people in multiple cities that work for this bank have impressed me.
Joe and his staff are fantastic; i get fantastic service every time i visit this branch.
Good service and they don't rip you off.
I left a 17 year relationship with bank of america for compass in oct. 2012.
I'm very happy with the customer service i receive every time i stop by.
I highly recommend them as being a yes bank instead of a no bank.
I received excellent customer service from maria moran!
She was very thorough in explaining all the details of the different services they have to offer.
She took the time to ensure i chose the right checking account, by explaining in detail how each one works.

They where quick with getting our loan done also.
I telephoned bank of the west today about a pending financial transaction.

Opened an account here today and received excellent customer service from peggy.
I've been banking with this bank since i was 14 when i got one of my first jobs and loblaws.
I can say that i've never had a problem with this bank.
I personally would recommend this bank, but please read the rest of my review.
Not too bad - the companies involved stopped the charges or refunded the money that had already been taken.
I entered with two out of state checking accounts, a recent large deposit, and a barely used checking account.
I was helped this afternoon by the senior personal banker, monica l. she was incredible.
She explained everything, made recommendations, and helped me put my accounts in the best position to work for me.
I came away with an arizona checking account and a money market account.
The two out of state accounts will be transitioned out once the fraud charges have been restored.
I have been a boa customer for 8 years, but rarely use their services other than online.
I scoured the internet to find the bank or credit union that was offering the lowest rate.
I was so impressed by her prompt service and attention to detail.
I have both my auto loans through one nevada.
I'm not the biggest fan of pnc banks, but this one was pretty decent.
Everyone is always very knowledgeable and helpful with my banking needs.
I love banking here and will continue to do so because of the staff and the amazing app.
That's what you call amazing service.
Everyone is very helpful and it's nice to have in a bank because not all banks are like that.

Centennial has a no hassle business model - offers fair pricing, amazing customer service and a true no pressure experience.
I have yet to have any problems with any of my accounts with them and dig their low rates.
Highly recommend sergio becerra to anyone that's looking to buy a house and need a loan officer.

I went in to make changes to my account.
It reminds me why i bank here!
I went here to open a second chance checking account.
It was super easy to open an account.
* all transactions hit your account immediately, so you don't have to worry about being overdrawn.
Cons for second chance checking: * they charge you a fee of $20 a month.
My review is in regards to home loans.
I have worked with loan representative, matthew fitzpatrick, for a couple of years.
There are no other "big banks" i would refer other than chase, and most specifically matthew.
I use them for checking, savings, and auto loans.
Cindy burgoz is what i call the epitome of quality customer service.
Please accept my gratitude towards her and your firm for the efficient service provided.
I got my home loan here (was recommended by my friend).
Dawn, the home loan specialist has made my experience flawless, a positive one.
I would not hesitate to approach her again for a car loan in the future..

Suzie was excellent helping me apply for my first loan and credit card!
I made the best financial decision by banking here!!!
Corie the bank manager is amazing and very informative.

It is good bank.
My experience with setting up new accounts, buying money orders or just having a question answered have all been positive.
I have "banked" at crdit unions for over 40 years.
They are not as "greedy" as banks.
Great personalized service, they know us and never send us away displeased.
For any loan needs .....please go see dawn at the decatur branch.....you will be treated like royalty!!
My husband i are thoroughly please and would recommend cccu  & dawn for any home loan needs!
Super friendly service today by the banker who helped us open a savings account!
He told us to have a seat and that the banker would be right out.

They have really stepped up there customer service experience.
The pros: - friendly customer service.
- decent car-loan rates.
- charges account fees.
This bank made my parents feel like people and not numbers or money.
I was at chase bank yesterday.
Large branch for all you personal and business banking needs.
I value their work and that is why i bank with them.
Even gave me the addresses of the nearest sister branches i could go to to retrieve money from my account.
Cashier's check easily obtained with no account but a credit card with them.
I only frequent the bank once a monthly maybe and for them to remember was pretty surprising and appreciated.
I was referred to one nevada by a friend and wanted to say the service i received was incredible.
Great friendly service from rebecca.
Come here and deposit or withdraw money.
Derrick martial is the man can get your auto loan with no hassle.
I didn't have any difficulty to get my loan with 1.9 apr.
I will not bank anywhere else
The bank itself sucks as they charge high fees, but the staff is great.
Time to mix it up... with a review of my bank!
I started with them when i opened my first bank account in georgia close to 15 years ago.
He loves his bank, but i somehow convinced him to keep our shared account at bofa.
Nonetheless, i'm still a loyal bofa customer and can't complain about their services at all.
I'm not losing money either though.
He is going back to see if he can get a better rate on his auto loan.
Thank you for the continued excellent service after all these years!
One nevada employs knowledgeable loan officers that will make sure you get what you deserve with your money.
Uwcu has been the best banking experience i've ever had.
When i took out a car loan, a similar thing happened.
), i was approved for a very large loan at the lowest rate available.
He took the hassle of my car buying experience by providing excellent customer service.
Your money is 100% available, no lock in cd etc.
You receive reimbursement up to $20 on atm fees at other banks if you meet the qualifications above.
Everyone should bank at one nevada it's the best....
The online banking isn't very good but everyone at the branch was very helpful.
Never thought i would be reviewing a bank, but that's the beauty of yelp!
I have been with this bank for about 8 years or so and have never had a problem with them!
I love their free checking and i have a savings account with them as well.
They have always been fair and their customer service is unequalled.
Can you say that about any of these huge corporate banks...?
All banks are awful.
There's a bank for everyone and i really wish there was some sort of "which bank is best for you?"
They ship them out at record speed, unlike some of the other banks.
While you can withdraw money from american atms, you can't use debit the way you can with other bank cards.
Bottom line:  this is a no frills bank.
So if you still have a account with b of a, please got to this branch.
I've had only positive experiences at this bank.
The service is exceptional!!!
She set really took care of me, refreshing change of banks.
Pretty good for a bank.
I'm surprised that there is such a low rating for this bank because i have regularly had good experience here.
So my other bank is the most widely hated corporation on the face of the earth.
I'm rarely in the bank for more than a few minutes.
My other bank otoh is always long line.
So by comparison i would say that this banks performance is good.
One nevada on craig road in north las vegas has the best customer service.
If you want great service and great communication with quality standards she's the one to see

I'm very thankful for their service and i would recommend this store to anyone.
I have banked here for a few years now.
I cannot appreciate the personal banker ivy zhang for all her help.

Fast, and saving almost 3% apr!
I've been banking here for over a year now and couldn't imagine going anywhere else with my money.
Service is generally good, hours are good and they are open on sunday.
When i realized it, i ventured back to the bank but it was gone.
Too many advantages over banks!
You are a member/owner and are treated as such even if you only have a few dollars in your account!!!
The service is great and their mobile app is super easy to use.
Come bank with one nevada credit union !

Thank you one nevada for the great service.
My bank for life now !
Awesome customer service !
Been banking here for 6 years and never had one problem.
Overall a good bank
The bank officers and account managers are cold, unsympathetic, and rude.
The main room is modern, professional and very bank-like.
It's hit or miss whether they'll charge $5 for making a money order, or they'll do it for free.
I've been with bank of america for somewhere in the neighborhood of 15 years or more.
I'm a big fan of citibank, and this is my local branch.
Recently moved to town and -- obviously -- had to find a new bank.
It may be that things like banking services aren't so easy to evaluate in this format.
There are many, many variables with banking services and many ways that people can have a less-than-ideal experience.
My main interest is with the basics of checking and savings.
The online banking system is not the most user-friendly one i've encountered, but it seems passable.
My aunt had an issue while she was on vacation with her account be double charged by a hotel.
When they could not get it resolved, the bank reviewed the account and refunded her the money.
The bank said they will address the corporate office of the hotel to get a refund.
No waiting time and great customer service!
They took the time to explain the account and perks offered to members and answered all of our questions.
Yay bank of america!
But it's the bank i've been with ever since i've been in this country.
I can't say much about the interior and the face-to-face service.
Went in to open an account, rep listened to what my intentions for the account were and made a recommendation.
Small bank always a line.
We have now landed at the summerlin bank of america.
Yes bank of america,  ahh the mcdonalds of all banks.
This bank is always efficient and is very clean.

You are an absolute gem, and everyone should bank at cuwest in prescott arizona because of you.
Suze was professional and informed, something that is becoming so rare in customer service.
Great service and they really figure out the best route to take in what u want to accomplish.
I like going in this my local branch bank.
She has the best customer service skills ever....what a doll.
She treats every customer like they have a million dollars in the bank!
My wife and i came in for an auto loan and rebecca and samantha assisted us.
I was given misinformation regarding a very important loan, and there is no one taking responsibility.
After posting my review and i'm happy to say that i feel better than ever about banking here.
I have been banking with citi for 6 years and haven't had any issues.
You also get free wire transfers to other banks.
For atm services, you can use any scotia bank atm free of charge.
If that is something you need often, you will need an account in another bank.
This bank is very convenient!
This is my first time banking with af .
They are always knowledgeable regarding products and services, and if they aren't sure, they find out instead of guessing.
I feel comfortable sitting with bankers they always know what they're doing.
It was great team work and excellent service.
I want to give a special thanks to eduardo c. thanks so much for displaying such exemplary customer service.
As a professional in the customer services world.
Krystina was my banker and she was very sweet and professional.

I have used ing direct (ing) for high rate savings for a few years.
I am happy with the online services that i have received so far.
I have never used its mortgage service, so i cannot attest to it.
Ing was bought by scotia bank (bns) in 2012.
After some changes with rude tellers the bank is much improved.
We have some parent loans for our kids' college tuition which will be paid off by our kids.
Where is the direction of banking heading?
You walk into the banks now and it's either empty or extremely busy depending on the timeframe you visit.
It was ghost town like none of the cubicles were filled with bankers and the tellers were ummm there..
Very good customer service the teller who helped me was very professional and processed my transaction fast!
I bank here all the time and have come to expect the decent service that they offer.
I've always had great service at this branch.
Tellers are friendly and fast, and even visits with a banker are quick.
This by far is my favorite chase bank to go to.
Always friendly staff, quick service and a pleseant experience.
Most services i use charge no fee, which is a welcome change compared to wells fargo or bank of america.
This location provides prompt attentive service.
Was able to apply for car loan with phone while traveling, then swing by this branch to accept paperwork.
Recently came in to open a checking account after researching other federal cu because you can never be too certain.
It was odd to me that it doesn't have that bank atmosphere.
All the tellers are all professional but they talk amongst each other and have no dividers, unlike other banks.
From response time, to options, to honesty, and to service level, the team here is nothing short of awesome!
I dreaded the days i had to drive far north or south to handle things with my bank.
Jeremy truly cares about his clients and his team is extremely professional and service oriented.
You just select the account you want to deposit the money in and you can combine both cash and checks.
Banks are banks and let's be honest this isn't always your favorite errand to run especially on a lunch break!
I very rarely go inside the bank but yesterday i had no choice.
Finally i was acknowledged and signed in to see a banker.
Great help getting my issues taken care of with my account!!!
Thank you :)) their bankers are extremely friendly and know their stuff.
I wanted to give this business five stars, but the reality is they are, after all, bankers!
We have many different types of accounts with them for the past 10 years
Sontino graham gave us the best service you could receive.
Been banking with them since before they ever dreamed of being a wells fargo.
Seems lots of people are lighting up wells fargo, bank of america and basically all of the banks these days.
I'm not picky about banks and i'm not threatening to run off with another bank and move my money.
I don't think wells fargo or bank of america are any better than the other.
They're just huge financial institutions where we all keep our money so we can use it on the daily.
Like most chase branches here in arizona customer service is superb.
I've banked with chase for a while now and i love my experience every time i go into a branch.
I enjoy banking with them.
They provide great customer service and the employees are very knowledgeable of the different services they offer.
Whether it's opening/closing accounts, offering financial advice, anything, see kayla williams.
I'm leaving my bank to bank at wells fargo and kayla is a lot of the reason why.
I hate talking to people about money, but she is understanding and so so so helpful!
Samuel gave me excellent customer service!!
Thank you samuel for your wonderful customer service!!!
I have closed three home loans with mary vrana and her team over the past 6 years.
I have closed on a fha, va, and conventional loans that have always closed on time.
Save yourself a lot of time and money by giving sun american mortgage a call for your next home loan.
There was literally no wait to speak to a banker to assist me.
Going into the bank is a pain.
But if there were more bankers like lakiesha it would no longer be so tedious.
I couldn't have been more pleased with the loan process and their dedication to helping us secure our loan.
I also have access to his account online.
And the reason i'm giving a simple bank five stars?
I used to bank with wells fargo and bank of america and i would never go back.
This is my go to bank.
I am forever grateful as i am still very young- 16. and i dont know too much about money management.
He was extremely professional and delivered on all promises including delivering a fantastic rate and excellent customer service.
Erica asked a few questions and suggested the perfect account for my needs.
This bank is open 7 days a week & they waive charges at non- midfirst atms!
They are the last of all investment services i use to get my tax information to me.
They both led me in the right direction and gave me future advice on my next loan.
If you need help with anything at this bank this branch and their staff are the best.
I would consider opening a chase account based on my experience at this location.
I was in the chinatown area and needed to do some banking.
Even after having graduated from college i haven't looked elsewhere because i really love this bank.
Now it's been about 6 years since i've done my personal banking with them and at this location.
Service was fast and efficient.
The best bank in las vegas!
Easy to work with, no monthly fees, only one dollar to open & great customer service!
He was insanely fast with providing our pre-qual letter as well as processing everything for our loan.
I am not a yelper but i am so impressed by midfirst bank and this location i had to.
They are a great place to bank with.
They call you when they see unusual charges to your account.
Forget bb&t, bank of america or wells fargo.
You give them your money, then when you need it back, you just go ask for it.
They have these things you can write on, to make it so you can give your money to other people.
You then give them more money than you took out to begin with.
They do other things to either take more of your money, or make it so you have more money.
And all this time, i had kept my money under the bed.
He's very informative and makes banking or whatever it's called!
I'm gonna go bank next week to set some more stuff up!
Go here if you want great friendly service
Level of service, awesome!!!
Everyone smiles and says hello the moment you enter the bank and everyone is eager to be of service.
Fast and friendly drive thru service.
The layout is different than most banks i've been too, but it works for their location.
We just moved all.of our accounts to this bank.
They were very helpful in setting up a new business account and moving the rest of our personal accounts.
Michael the bank president was great to work with, and i would recommend them to anyone.
Just opened an account and refi my truck loan.
Easy process, great service, super friendly, smiles and great corporate phone service as well!
Today i went to wells fargo & it wouldn't allow me to take money out of my savings.
Both verifying that i was the one who tried to take money out of my account.
The bank rates suck!
The banker was fast and professional.
I have been attempting to set up a checking account all over town.
Most banks had high fees, check holds and all kinds of hoops to jump through.
Also, the other banks staff was not all that helpful.
As long as i am to be living in vegas, i will do all my banking with, amitra!
They've helped me with all sorts of banking needs, from home, to auto loans, credit cards, multiple accts, etc etc.
I've always had good customer service here... but i'm making sure it happens if it is ever lacking.
I don't think this branch is much different than any other... or any other bank.
Gave it 4 stars.. great first time but i do not trust banks in general..
So i'll update after 6 months of how service is really treating me!
Great customer service floats my boat and hearing about wells fargos banking service added one more star.
* keep in mind my grandmother said to not bank with them , for some odd reason ?
I'm always greeted with a smile and attentive quick service.
As far as banks go, chase has provided far superior service than any other bank i have ever used.
Decided to go with a credit union over my main stream bank that kept charging me fees for stupid reasons.
They had my accounts setup and a real usable check card exteremely fast.
My old bank took days and 3 weeks to get my check cards in the mail.
This is the best bank out there.
I would never wanna leave this bank.
Excellent customer service and really good auto loan rates especially for someone like me with new credit.
They would sell me accounts that i didn't need and their speed was sub par.
We had a va loan which sometimes can  be cumbersome.
This is another full service bank.
I bank elsewhere, but i lived closer would consider this bank because of these time saving features.
Banks arent my favorite, but i have met quite a few bankers i like here.
I'm always greeted with a smile and attentive quick service.
As far as banks go, chase has provided far superior service than any other bank i have ever used.
I was here today to alter some of my accounts and had no issues.
To this day switching my bank of bank of america is the best thing i have ever done.
I do my business banking here and find it to be more pleasant than the average bank.
If someone steals from you they get your money back faster than any other bank!
Bank is  a bank so nothing too special.
I mainly come here to move cash between my accounts
I would recommend this location to anyone looking to take care of the banking needs.
These are not necessary to open a checking account.
This is the only wells fargo branch i use, as the customer service is superior, helpful and efficient.
That's why i love doing business with us bank.
I have received the worst customer service from midfirst bank via telephone.
I have been a member with midfirst bank for years now.
I am sticking to navy federal, and other banks.
Midfirst is not even a last resort, just do not bank with them.. period!
Now with bulletproof glass for your banking inconvenience!
The tellers (or, in wells speak, "bankers") are friendly enough, but the training is pretty inconsistent.
This is my preferred royal bank branch.
Great customer service and convenient location/drive up!
I admit banks scare me, which is why i banked with washington mutual.
Their set up made going to the bank less intimidating.
We just refinanced again to get some money out the loan.
If you work with him he will send video clips that explain each step of the loan process.
I normally use the atm or mobile banking great alternatives.
Always excellent service whether for personal banking or business banking.
Had a great experience today with a personal banker.
Their service is great and its easy to get in and out within 10 minutes.
Ok, i'm writing another review on a bank, but i feel this branch deserves better than 1 star rating.
I was in there recently with my son to open up a teen account.
Melynda was our personal banker who helped us set this up.
I saw many people gave the bank poor rating.
Because they expected bank of china same liked international banks.
They will appreciate the bank of china in toronto is follow the operating standard in china.
Dear wells fargo on central,  i consider this bank my home bank.
Free checking, savings, atm... best rates on other financial products... so definitely don't want to misinform out there.
It doesn't get much better than navy federal as far as handling your day to day money goes.
I really like this bank it's has been by far one of the best banks that i have banked with.
Every time i go whether it be inside or the drive thru i get great service.
I have banked with several institutions before trying chase and i am glad that i did.
Yes, bank of america atm's and branches are everywhere throughout charlotte.
In my book, that's pretty solid from a bank!
Sean has amazing customer service skills, which are lacking in many professionals today.
He was so helpful and made sure my transaction went through ok to my other accounts.
There is no service fee on returns.
Just switched my business account here from desert schools and couldn't be happier!!!
Money from check deposits are available within 1-2 days,  the service has been super fast and super friendly.
I will refer anyone to this bank!
Jeremy and his team were amazing with both a refinance and new loan.
I have worked with many banks across many states and this chase location is head and shoulders above the rest.
It truly feels as if they want you to succeed financially, can you say that about you bank?
Please do keep branch office open as without this local branch i would not bank with boa.
It helps when you are trying to manage your money.
This bank while making a profit at least will give you tools to help you manage from your perspective.
Opened our account and mainly deal with the eastern branch in henderson.
Supporting a credit union versus a big greedy and unethical bank feels really really good!
First, let me say that banking and trading through charles schwab has always been an amazing experience for me.
Plus, when setting up your account they send you a bunch of free checks.
They have some nice bankers here, currently helpful are michelle and gregory.
Also i appreciate their international wire service inside.
The manager of this bank is so helpful and had just moved here from calf!
Love these guys, wonderful, customer service, low rates, reasonable fees.
I see no reason to keep using large, thieving corporate banks when awesome little credit unions like this exist.
Great benefits and customer service.
Remember when you liked your bank??
I should add that the big banks really don't care that much about loyalty, as someone tried to say below.
Great customer service all around; i'll keep sticking with them if they keep giving me great rates such as this.
I have used this credit union for at least a decade and the service has always been consistently good.
Rodolfo acosta has been phenomenal assisting me in setting up my investment and brokerage accounts and an unrestricted checking account.
The best banking service i've ever had!
Went in today to meet an individual who banks with them to get an auto loan for my vehicle.
Now this is how a bank should do customer service.
Came here for the same reason most people do: to do money things.
I make a respectable salary that's directly deposited into checking acct.
Applied for a car loan.
Please deposit $5 to become a member and open up a savings.
Ok. you'd like an auto loan.?
I opened a checking acct too and will be transferring my business to nfcu.
I have never had such amazingly efficient, fast, thorough, & professional customer service ever.
I will be recommending this bank to every veteran & vet family member i know.
It's been over a year since i began banking with them, then there after financing my vehicle through them.
Looking forward to continuing to get great service from navy federal.
I have come to like the employees and have had no issues with my account.
Friendly and quick service.
Didn't ask me stupid questions or make me jump through hoops to cash a check and withdraw money.
Lately wells fargos have been slipping in their customer service department but not this one!
I recently set up a youth account for my 15 year old son.
I funded his new checking and savings account with about $50 each.
Savannah helped me open some accounts and was very knowledgeable.
This is the bank we have our mortgage with.
We have been on the fence about transferring our banking there as well.
We did open an account so we could schedule an automatic mortgage payment.
I an impressed that they are a full service bank open 7 days a week and located inside a safeway.
I give truwest five stars for great customer service and ease of use with all of their services!
The best customer service experience i have ever had with a financial institution.
It's local and more accountable to members, so there are less obnoxious fees ect.
So the best customer service ever!
Just went there to make a deposit, little did i know the account i have cost me $3.
Wow they set up the account and are mailing me the paperwork needed and bank cards.
Also one of the bankers that assisted me gave me his card, his name is duncan lang.
Our receipt did not have the address of the bank.
These things have nothing to do with the retail bank location being reviewed and thusly, are not taken into consideration.
The bankers often are behind the teller line to convince people to sit with them firms financial review.
Opened a new account - very friendly and communicative!
The service is excellent, the people are friendly, and they offer great loan rates to their customers.
Yes, there are fewer branches than i would like, but the personal, inexpensive service is well worth the travel!
Try hitting the bank at 8 am or 4pm here and it's just horrible.
I really love the bank, the workers, etc.
Let me remind everyone my experience is only based on banking, not on loans of any sort.
Best and i mean best customer service i've received since having been a member of boa.
Our first meeting was pleasant and informative, but i had to set an appointment to discuss my business accounts.
He went above and beyond the call of banking duty and got everything taken care of.
He is professional, warm and personalizes his service.
I am now an even bigger fan of bank of america.
Great service, best banking experience ever!!!
I highly recommend navy federal to anyone that appreciates fast in and outs, and polite and courteous service..
Much better than using a bank or changing money at the airport.
I want everyone to know what great service i receive from this branch.
I belong to 3 different banks in town but us bank is #1.
Ask bryan  about a veterans account when you stop in.
Had to come into a branch because customer service f'd a lot up over the phone.
Great teller service :)
So far my experiences with us bank has been  amazing.
My husband and i have banked here for over four years and have never had any issues.
They're quick, efficient and the customer service is fantastic.
She made another account and put temporary money in it  to save the day.
We plan on in a couple months getting our home loan through them too
Thank you so much to stacey davis-evans and cathy hansen for the outstanding customer service.
Came in here on a saturday and i'm not gonna lie... service is slow.
We walked in at 12pm and left the bank at around 130pm.
The banker however was nice, friendly and personable so it offsets the long wait and slow service.
Probably the best bank to.
I was able to get two accounts started and get two credit cards.
Im going to try and get my home loan through them to well see how that goes!
I have been banking with wells fargo for two years now and i have always had excellent customer service.
I was extremely happy to find so many wells fargo banks here in arizona after moving here recently from oregon.
I can see myself banking with heartland for a long time.
Definitely recommend their services.
The bank is very large and welcoming.
Right now it is 9:50am in the morning and i am 6 people deep in the line at the bank.
I called our bank and few others to see what they could offer, which was a joke.
Hopefully these guys get awards, as their level of customer service is beyond the norm.
We will continue to bank here.
I had to open a new account after experiencing a fraudulent close down of my wells fargo account.
Kelsey wight set up my new account very quickly and was so professional and personable.
The service here is always exceptional.
No one enjoys errands or going to the bank, but here the transactions are seamless, pleasant, and without any hitches.
I called the branch to make a same-day appointment with a banker.
Thanks for the professional and efficient customer service!
Great customer service, hospitality.
My mom, however, has banked with them for years now and swears by them.
The customer service and attention to detail was amazing.
I am now considering switching banks!
I drive from across town sometimes just to bank at that branch...they are externally professional and make you feel welcome.
I highly recommend this bank of america location!
I've used calforex a number of times to change money before a trip.
They have always had better rates than any other exchange place or bank.
It adds up if you are exchanging a lot of money, so finding a good place is important.
She made sure to give us the best coverage and save the most money.
Customer service is number one for me and that they had.
I have not been banking with well's fargo very long but every experience i've had has been a good one.
Nothing special, but a bank.
They have a convinient, safe on-location drive thru and walk up service.
He gave me great ideas to improve my finances even before the loan process started.
Great accounts, free atms, and superb customer service!
They always take the time to look into my account and help improve my policy.
Welcome to vegas, where everyone spends money like it's going out of style.
Great service and it's a beautifully renovated branch i love coming here it's never busy with no line ups.
This is my new favorite bank.
Each month i make an appearance to pay my car loan.
There also seem to be a lot of personal banking employees standing around or chatting by the desks.
I love there customer service they always find ways to make sure you have no questions unanswered.
I have to admit this young man have consumers service experienced .
This bank is very lucky to have this man working for them.
He is always our go to guy and offers competitive rates and the best customer service around!
Therefore by switching i make more money, and keep more money.
I definitely recommend this bank!
Great service by torrie hinds, consumer banker!
Went above and beyond and stayed late to get our business account open!
I consistently receive excellent customer service.
Professional, knowledgeable and friendly customer service.
At the end of the day, a bank is a bank.
The only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because it took forever to open an account.
Not because we had to wait for service but because the lady doing it was super slow.
Not the biggest fan of the bank or any bank but where else are you going to put your money.
We were so frustrated with the process of trying to modify our loan.
We tried working with the banks to modify but were pushed into endless circles chasing paperwork for over a year.
We now have a conventional mortgage at a much lower rate saving us over $600/month.
The peace of mind we get from his outstanding service and follow through is second-to-none.
Good local service and better rates that the online-only companies.
However, we decided to do a bit more research for this loan and came across pinnacle capital.
Now that is customer service!
I wholeheartedly recommend them to anyone looking for a home loan or refinance.
They saved me a ton of money, provided great, competitive rates, and their technology meant only one actual phone call.
The few times i've used this branch, i've been pleased with the customer service and friendly attitude of the staff.
This branch has excellent customer service.
Jesse opened a new account for me and was very helpful and friendly.
I highly recommend this branch if you're going to open a chase account in scottsdale.
Our loan closed a week early without a hitch.
The banking industry is changing fast, but i'm impressed with the b of a model.
This is the best customer service i have ever received at any banks.
I do business with 2 other banks and they can't compare with this wells fargo branch.
Ok if you just want a lock down secure banking establishment, boa is it for you!
They are secure even with the owner of the money!!!
Thank goodness for the new instant debit card service and the wonderful helpful staff at this location!
None of this would be possible without the staff at pinnacle capital mortgage and there precise and extremely speedy service.
If you are a merchant don't go to this bank.
However, it is a convenience we as business accounts pay for many times over.
Top notch customer service.
He was also helpful with recommending other service professionals that are as highly experienced as himself.
She was very helpful, friendly and she provided very great customer service.
I like this bank since it's well positioned and normally really well air cooled!
When i first moved to phoenix this bank was close to my home.
Now, years later...i still only go to this bank if i need to "walk in".
Just an amazing level of service.
They need to clone that lady as she is what service is about.
This has to be the worst banking institution that i have ever dealt with.
Their customer service is is non existent and their technology is something that the 80s would be proud of.
Try to get something done through their customer service has been a complete and utter nightmare.
Go to a real banking institution.
I've been banking with chase for years...every since living in chicago...and was happy to continue my relationship out here.
They reversed the fees and changed my account so it wouldn't happen again in the future.
Fantastic service, inside and at the drive up teller window.
The staff is always pleasant and efficient in helping with your banking needs.
I've been banking with pnc for little over ten months now and i'm impressed.
A place where they've figured out a way to actually live their "banking can be this comfortable" slogan.
They are also home to one of the only vaults with absolutely no cash money in.
Overall a very comfortable and innovative banking experience and mississauga is very lucky to have the first of its kind.
Banking is now more comfortable than ever!
She helped and explained everything with me being new to bank accounts.
I'm happy with the choice of bank i went with
Let me start by stating a plain and simple fact, "i hate walking into banks."
Honestly though, this is the one branch that really, really works hard at making you a satisfied banking customer.
The bottom line, if you have to go inside a bank, i recommend this branch.
I look for services at a good price.
I have a safe deposit box which is bigger and cheaper than the local banks.
I have a car loan that is more competitively priced than the local banks.
I take my loose change in and use their change machine (free for customers) and really appreciate that service.
My one complaint is there website/internet banking.
I maintain only a small checking account here and use others for my main checking.
I opened my accounts at midfirst in 2008 and have been a super happy camper with this bank.
Customer service is phenomenal!
They have awesome banking hours.
My atm w/d fees get reimbursed if i used another bank's atm.
The bank's lobby has a lovely welcoming ambiance.
I have only gone inside a couple times, but wow on the customer service!
Then i was escorted to the door and i told the manager that my service was definitely a 10!!!
I highly recommend the lawrenceville citizens bank location on butler and main st.
I've always been given the best customer service there.
I have purchased and refinanced many times over the years using every type of lender, broker, banker etc.
Needed a loan to help bridge my daughters medical expenses for one month.
I hate going to banks or inquiring about this stuff.
It was a nice alternative for short-term loans.
( i should add that i physically went to at least 3 other title loan places and walked away.)
I've had a checkered history with banks, especially those with false information!
My bank told me they had euros on site, went to the bank, they had nothing!
I was extremely happy and impressed with this quick and easy service and i wish more places were like this.
So i walk into this bank and everyone was very friendly.
I have banked with chase for years and have always had great service.
Today we came in to open a new business account, a rather long process, anita vega was our banker.
Great job chase for maintaining customer loyalty where there are so many banking choices.
To top it off, i got money back to apply towards my closing costs.
The service at this location is often slow but always friendly.
I am always greeted as i enter the bank.
Don't feel entitled but found respect for my service and made me feel good about bing a vet.
Down home friendly banking in a big city is hard to find.
Great customer service most of the bankers are bilingual even though that doesn't apply to me.
I really am amazed at the level of customer service.
Everyone in phoenix should give him an opportunity to save themselves money on their mortgages.
Best chase bank in town.
I already had a number of bank accounts, but my brother encouraged me to open an account.
At the time i lived in san diego so it made more sense to have a local account.
You really can't go wrong with banking with navy fed.
The exact opposite of dealing with the global banks i've previously been associated with.
The inside of this location is quiet and we'll organized...not much else to say, it's a bank folks.
Just another chase bank.
As all of the banks they need more customer support and service.
A little frustrating at times considering they're holding your money.
=) the person who helped my husband & i open an account for the 1st time moved to this location.
That's great customer service if you ask me.
Overall, great customer service if you do a walk-in as well as the drive-thru.
Great service- don't go during peak hours.
Lafotasi is helpful, en pointe, and a rarity in customer service.
Signed up after them coming out to my work offering better rates on loans and better service.
I can't think of anywhere else i've been treated like this, certainly not a bank.
5 stars for all my basic banking needs!
Dave and kathy did a wonderful job helping us find the right loan that fit our needs.
We knew from the foreclosure not to have a arm loan that makes payments over 3 years higher and higher.
He is a work-a-holic who went out of his way to ensure our loan was approved and processed timely.
I would recommend zac to all my friends and family and will use his services in the future!
Went to this bank and had excellent service.
Lindsay helped us open an account and was very honest about everything.
The card for the account was ready that day.
I felt very fortunate to go to a bank that was helpful and knew all their clients who walked in.
As is consensus, customer service is terrible.
Personal bankers standing around talking amongst themselves, picking and choosing which customers to ignore.
Greatest bank in arizona.
Great bank and great employees, this is what banking is all about.
I started working on the loan process with jeremy at pinnacle capital almost a year in advance.
Everything was organized and in place when i found my home and the loan process was seamless.
At any other bank when you make a cash deposit your cash is available instantly.
I went in to talk to a personal banker about opening up several savings accounts for long term goals.
There were two bankers gossiping about a previous customer that looked at me as i signed in.
Brian pinney was very helpful & sought ways to help save me money.
I have been with midfirst bank for over two years now and love them.
Their customer service is the best around - bar none.
I am getting 2% on my checking account balance and i don't have to have a huge balance in it.
No atm fees, sunday hours, extended weekly hours, beautiful, well designed, elegant bank facilities!
They are not a publicly traded bank that is beholding to stockholders and wall streets quarterly whims.
Sce is a very wonderful bank i highly suggest getting this bank, great friendly staffs and an satisfied costumer service.
Other than that the customer service is good and bank is very neat and clean.
I'm not a huge fan of the bell they would like you to ring if you received great service.
So, i'll give five stars to this bank location, and 2 or 3 stars to "banking" as a general concept.
So what can you say about a bank, you go there, deposit your money and you leave.
Now let's talk about their online banking: it's ok.
Their phone service:  terribly long wait time, always.
Regarding the service at their café, i went once and it was ok.
Top notch service all the way!
I came here after checking out bendix & guardian, they both offered worser rates.
He did a wonderful job of expediting our loan and explaining each step along the way.
Rbc, a giant who will provide your basic banking needs.
They have exceptional customer service and we appreciate that very much.
This is one of the branches we frequent the most, and have consistently had good service.
I don't bank here, but i'm strongly considering changing my accounts to wells fargo at this location.
I've been having a heck of time cashing a treasury savings bond, my credit union didn't do it.
I'm going to look into banking here.
They worked extremely hard to close our loan early per our request and i can't thank them enough!
The bank is good for deposits and withdrawals.
Bofa is an easy bank to access.
They all have atm's drive and walk up,  this bank has drive up.
All banks might have this option.
It's not the bank of the past.
Friendly folks safeguarding your money.
I love wells fargo bank!
I was a bank of america customer and finally decided to leave them i was never satisfied with them.
Wells fargo customer service is amazing specially this location.
This new branch is nice and accessible, the customer service and the staffs are awesome especially jordan.
I've been banking with this pnc branch (formerly national city) since 2006.
The staff here are amazing - they really make the whole banking experience seamless and easy whenever possible.
He is without a doubt the most trusted, knowledgeable, and professional loan officer to work with.
I can't say enough about the level of service i received from zach, tyler and sharon.
Only complaint is the extreme wait to see a customer service rep, painfully slow.
This bank does not treat you like another number.
I should have joined this credit union before as it's member services and products are on point.
I had to open a business account and i went to this bank.
I met ruppi who begin to help me with the business account.
I had the online banking and a nice new debit card in the mail.
This bank is awesome!!!
I love their customer service!
Alethea helped me open a new account and she was super helpful, warm, and welcoming.
I felt very comfortable handling my banking at this branch and i really appreciated it!
I'd love to come back here and do more banking with my account!
Great customer service and great services and deals.
The customer service at this branch is incredible!
I have been going here for years.... ricardo, the business banker is top notch, no matter what i need.
Like all business,  bank branches have cut back on staffing.
I got my rv loan through america first.
The customer service is awesome at this branch.
Decent bank (they all have their issues) and you can get free checking with direct deposit.
Everything one would expect from a banking experience.
Very easy to use as an online bank, good smart phone app and web service.
They didn't have too many citibank locations that was easily accessible without a car back then.
Okay, thanks for keeping a watchful eye on my legitimate account activity and causing minor inconvenience.
Thank you yuko for calling the back office to resolve the temporary account suspension.
Great service, greets guests, proactive, and helpful.
I love this bank!
The bankers their were very friendly and prompt.
They also offer pretty much the same deals that any other bank offers.
All their banks are nicely appointed on the inside.
It is a lot different from any other banks.
Highly recommended as i can't stand chain businesses and too big to fail banks.
I always get quick professional personal service at this bank.
This is a full service branch.
Banking, mortgages, loans, investments and more.
They even have a couple computers for customers to use for accessing their online accounts.
This bank is on the corner of 16th street and osborn.
Thank you isalliah for giving such great customer service.
The staff is friendly, and the drive thru banking is never too busy.
Otherwise, a great place to bank.
This bank is stupid.
I've been banking at this branch since 2004.
But overall, it's still a pain to have to do any business inside the bank.
They also have a drive thru for banking on the go.
I've always had great service at scefcu.
If this is the case, i would recommend chase for friendly, convenient service.
Trust me, i ain't shedding no tears when i break up with bank of america.
Of all the banks.
They try to help make the best of my account and suggest different ways to make banking easier.
Staff was super friendly in helping us close our accounts.
I always feel that banks don't leave me, as a customer, with a lot of wiggle room.
I mean, they have my money.
Even though it's been busy, not once have i had a negative customer service experience here.
Also, wells fargo customers get free notary services here.
No fuss, no muss, and no money spent.
We started using our normal chase bank where we have investements, retirements, checking, even being a private client there.
How can you not give this bank a 5-star?
It opens on sunday, most banks don't.
It extend their business hours mondays thru fridays, most banks don't.
I love banking here, just used the notary service, no waiting in long lines.
The level of service sean and his office provide is second to none.
Such wonderful and patient service and longer hours than other branches!
Had some issues with online banking and sasha helped me settle everything, and did not rush me at all.
I dont' like to go to banks.
I had the best customer service.
I present my id and ask for money.
He gives me money.
Everyone in the bank was eager to help and make sure i was happy with their service.
I enjoyed my time inside the bank.
It is refreshing to receive such great customer service.
It's people like this that set chase above the other banks and why i prefer chase!
Look 4 stars for customer service at the drive thru.
The young guys here dress like old school bankers - real suit coat and tie.
Bebe is the best in setting up accounts and all the tellers are great.
Very nice branch with good service
No more drive-thru services, not sure when they stopped doing that.
But i guess everyone are just saving money on their expenses.
I would still bank with them, won't stop doing it just because they stopped one of their services.
Can you really love your bank ?
I originally opened an account at mid-first with no expectation thinking it just another bank.
I don't know how the training program is, but hand down the best banking experience i have had.
And they were never pushy toward any services making me very comfortable.
And agree with alan, the banking center is beautiful ....
(btw, i don't work for them, just impressed by their services)
Great place to bank with.
Also great care in establishing car and home loans.
This place is amazing it was fast, smooth, and everyone had a great customer service.
Came in near closing time to cash a check and was asked if i'd like to open account.
I usually hate going to the bank but this was the best experience i've had
With all the media attention retail banks are getting for "new fees" less customer service etc.
Little things, like smiling friendly service, recognizing you when you enter and leave the bank.
With their awsome bill pay service online and widely accepted debit card, im staying with wells fargo.
The service is unparalleled and their knowledge and efficiency is unmatched!
Really takes care of me and that deborah - amazing service.
Since chase is doing away with the drive through service i had to come inside.
He informed me about the atm service where i can deposit checks and explained the chase app to me.
I want to thank bianca guzman for all the help she has given my mother and i on our accounts.
This is the closest location to me that's an actual bank, not just a free-standing atm.
Service with a smile has always been the case, and i'm never just a customer.
If your money is in a bank, you're really missing out on the credit union membership experience.
Daysi provided excellent costumer service!
Amazing service, this is a fine example of costumer service.
We've been extremely happy with the service at this branch.
I opened my chase bank account at this location because it was close.
When i opened my account, my banker was friendly and gave me all the information i needed.
They're quick and friendly compared to other banks i've been to.
This particular bank is extremely friendly!
She didn't just say "have a great day," she enthusiastically said "thank you for banking with us today!"
This is a very well managed bank branch.
Service trucks working double time here.
Grade a+ on this branch for handling the flow of money evenly and carefully.
Now days how often do you actually have to walk into a bank?
Hmm... maybe that was money well spent?
Great benefits and customer service.
Diandra perone was fantastic at helping me change my name while the personal bankers were busy!
An hour and a half later we walked back into the bank and signed some papers.
Too many businesses ignore the importance of customer service.
The attendant had already taken any fees out of the money that i received.
She was very nice and smiled, and counted the money in front of me.
I was really impressed, since i had never exchanged money before.
All in all, great rate, fast, and pleasant service.
Our account person apologized several times.
I am 100% happy with bank of america service.
I am absolutely pleased at their genuine and outstandingly personal customer service.
Best bank of america in vegas!
One of the best decisions i've made switching to wells fargo bank.
Very pleased with us bank.
All this while i am on hold with the bank.
I went to the first banker, fabiola ramirez, and said please help me.
Someone is transferring the contents of my bank account to unauthorized recipients as we speak.
I gave her my drivers license and bank card and my phone.
New account, new login, new password, new security on my account.
And most importantly, all my money was immediately returned to my account.
I must say that i am really impressed with what they offer in terms of services and interest rates!
All the money transfers in and out of my bank account always in a prompt manners  interest rate.. sweet!
Tax saving account is at 3% with no commitment/minimum!
One draws back is you have to have another account in a full service bank!
Consistent great customer service.
However, they offer other conveniences that other banks or cu we used to do business with.
Fees are also minimal in contrast to the other financial institutions we used to bank with.
I've been to worse banks/locations, and i've been to better.
Still, every time, i get the same "would you like to open an account?"
When i come in to cash a paycheck drawn on their bank.
Same idea, sure, but that's the difference between good service and average.
Just commenting on service but they are quick and your always in and out quickly....very important these days.
They have plenty of people working inside this bank, and that is very rare for a bank these days.
This bank has always been well staffed when i go there and that is a big deal.
This was the first wells fargo bank at which i did business when i moved to nevada.
The loan process was extremely quick and zac did everything he could to make sure we closed in time.
Opened my first pnc account here.
We love  our bank!
I visited this branch at the first bank yelp event!
The staff was very friendly and bank manager andrew was just awesome!
Gosh i love this bank.
Today i stopped in to get approved for a vehicle loan and kirsty took care of me.
So refreshing dealing with a bank with your best interest in mind that looks out for you.
If already didn't have a bank i would move.
My experience for notary services was unbelievable.
I had heard notary services were available to non-members.
(the nearest location of my bank is aaaaallll the way in peoria.
But no, the smiling receptionist assured me i was, indeed, in a bank.
She also confirmed notary services were available and waved me over to the teller area.
I still had a feeling of disbelief that i was in a bank when i walked over.
(not that this is relevant to customer service.
And then i was a bit stunned that the notary service was free of charge.
Such a great bank.
I have a loan and two business accounts with this place.
Asu students get free checking accounts.
Besides that there are many different account types, personal and business, to fit your custom needs.
The tellers and personal bankers are all really nice and helpful.
The bank inside and out is beautiful.
Feels like a high scale hotel and not your run of the mill bank, very high quality.
Even though it's a nice looking bank i stay because of the service.
I've had bank accounts at several different banks and this is by far the best.
I always get fast immediate service and all the staff remember you.
Maybe the reason for their differences from other banks.
I have been to this us bank several times since i moved here in december.
The wf branch on flamingo and ft. apache is too crowded and not enough bank tellers.
Annie vuong is my personal banker and she's always helpful when i want to inquire about anything.
It's somewhat fast and efficient with bank teller services.
Don't bank here but always use their atm machines and cash checks here.
Drive thru atm and teller services.
The knowledge,  service and abilities of jeremy and the team are unparalleled.
All of our accounts are now with truwest.
Stellar service, employees are very friendly specially ryan he is my favorite.
I rarely actually go to a bank.
It's like the disney office of td bank.
The bankers here at midfirst bank are the nicest and are very kind and helpful here.
And they are very kind with helping you out with starting your bank account here at midfirst bank.
Very professional and superior customer service.
Isai juarez just took care of my banking needs, very pleasant experience!
He also gave me advice on some future accounts i need to open!
Our accounts were hacked and she's spent hours with us to remedy the problem.
The bank's  manager  should be more considerate and have more tellers at that time.
This was the second loan i closed with jeremy and his crew.
He got my home purchase loan back in 2009, and now we are closing in 3 days on my refinance.
Oh, by the way did i mention their fantastic customer-oriented service.
I recently opened a business account with m and i bank and i am so happy!
There you don't have a personal banker, you're lucky to get a call back.
However, at m and i bank, they take your relationship with them seriously.
You have your own personal banker who helps you with anything you need.
If you're not happy with your current banking situation, i highly recommend m and i bank!
Good auto loan rates  quick service.
Good auto loan rates
As a long time bank of america customer :  i.
I like that they specialize in assisting military personnel & their families with banking needs.
I recently vacationed in costa rica and had leftover money to change back into canadian dollars.
I was also preparing for a trip to thailand and indonesia, and converted money.
They have better rates than the big banks and they are always friendly and helpful down there.
Also, they don't gouge you with fees like the big banks.
Why do  you still do your banking at chase, bank of america, us bank, or any other large bank again???

One day i noticed that the transfer hadn't shown up on the child's account.
When was the last time you heard that from bofa, chase or anyother national bank?????
Pros: (1) free checking.
I mean truly free checking.
(2) free atm withdrawls at cooperating member atms (3) did i mention free checking?
This is the only bad experience i've had since i've been banking with them.
Have been banking with truwest cu since i was a kid and my dad opened my first savings account.
Their services are great and have been very helpful over the years.
Highly recommended for their savings and checking account options.
The assistant branch manager nicole koubek was extremely helpful in addressing my banking needs and provided awesome customer service!
One of the best banks i've ever had the pleasure doing business with.
This branch reflects the quality of customer service that i've come to expect from this credit union.
The drive up atms are very convenient and has given me a new appreciation for this bank.
Forget the big giant banks.
Excellent sophisticated , yet personal service.
If you miss your small credit union or bank, this credit union is the one!
This is my second loan with sun american mortgage, and i will use them for all my future mortgage needs.
Wouldn't it occur to them when they pull up an account that there is never any money in my checking?
Wouldn't that then prompt them to either ask or think that i would want my money in the savings account?
Just opened an account today, quick and efficient service.
Great location, looking forward to banking with them.
I opened my accounts up in the dobson/main branch some time ago.

Thanks again for the best service ever.
This bank of america is small, but convenient to my house and the customer service is always on point.
Unlike standing in the regular line i needed to see one of the personalized bankers, special.
Overall, a bank of america branch that is there to serve is customers.
Open later than most banks which is a major perk for me.
He thoroughly explained my loan options so i could make the best decision for my situation.
His team kept me regularly updated throughout my loan process.
My closing went very smooth and the loan funded right away after i signed.
This is an very nice bank.
Attractive space, ample parking and convenience make this an attractive banking location.
Excellent service i received at this location the many times i've been here.
2 people here and 4 bankers i've been standing here waiting for nothing.

Also there is a bus stop located out front and shuttle service between facilities.

Been with them for less than 3 months and their customer service has one-upped any other institution i've been with.
I was just very impressed by the initiative she took to provide anticipated customer service.
I wasn't expecting her to waive the fees, but she kindly offered the service with a smile on her face.
Great customer service still exists in this world!
I love this bank!
And whenever i have to go inside, the customer service is outstanding.
I have been banking with federal for over 20 years.
I went in to set up online banking and the lady in the office was super helpful.
I understand their jobs might be stressful, but this is a customer service business.
Services/rates offered are good.
The more "experienced" ladies especially could use a refresher course in customer service with a smile.
Im trying to get information about my account.
If you aren't ready for good customer service then this might not be the field for her.
Setup an appointment for a service need.
I love banking with u.s. bank.
I would highly recommend opening up accounts with this branch!
I don't bank with wells fargo but i do end up in this branch about once a month.
I prefer credit unions over banks because the rates are better and it supports the state/community you live in.
This credit union also doesn't charge for keeping your own money in safe keeping.
Where as the larger banks have monthly fees, minimum requirements, and every other fees you can make up.
Gosh, it's not like the bank was full of customers.
Hey, i'm not bad off but to show this mannerism it's shocking to hv to search my accounts that long.
Came to this location to be added on to an account.
As a new account holder, i appreciated the time and thoughtfulness i was provided.
The level of service was on point.
Hands down the best bank in az.

I also feel better with the financial stability of state farm, but most importantly, the service from sean.
Bankers pei or fernando are very gracious and helpful!
I own a small business and had gone to chase to open a business checking account.
I left chase bank and drove over to the intouch credit union on w. lake mead blvd.
I was immediately helped and opened a checking account for my business in about 30 minutes.
It's clear the bigger banks like chase couldn't care less about small business owners.
He didn't just give me a shallow greeting the way they do at my bank of america branch.

They walk you through every step of your loan!
Is this a bank?
It's not a traditional bank so they don't take cash deposits, and everything was done on an ipad.
I have 2 auto loans with them, got really good rates.
Signing up with  state farm, i was a bit skeptical that saving money was a possible.

Today i was privileged to be serviced by daniel and alex.
This is the best bank i have had to deal with.
Employees know how to do their job well, they are very well informed about the banking business in america.
Customer service on the phone is very helpful, too.
I sent an e-mail, got a quote, went in and exchanged my money.
Fast and professional is all you should want when exchanging money.
Enjoyed getting to know them and talk to them while im doing my banking business.

Their rates are also better than the bank.
I find their service to be extremely convenient.
Customer service is friendly.
Best banking experience i've ever had!
Lorenzo helped me open a savings and checking account, as well as a credit card.
He was upfront and respectful, didn't pressure me into opening the most expensive account.
It's a shame now that i'm moving to a different state, i would have loved making this my permanent bank.

The customer service i receive here is spot on every time and the conversation that takes place is exceedingly pleasant.
Huntington has given me some problems as a bank in general, but there's nothing wrong with this branch at all.

The branch is extremely clean, even by bank standards, and even when they're busy it's relatively quiet.
The personal bankers here are fine too.
Since i rarely have to deal with managers in a bank, i'll hardly hold that against them.

I don't even bank with wells and i'm considering it now.
I am so happy with the service we have from this office!
I can't express my gratitude  enough for the great service recieved!
This location has best best customer service!!
Also there's options so can work with you i do recommend this location if you looking for title loan,
Fees are fair and he's all about saving his clients money.
Went in this morning to open an account with their 50/50 promo and katie was great!
I went through wells fargo originally to get my home loan.
As a new customer to compass, i've been nothing but pleased with their services and their staff at this location.
Since opening the account, i've visited this location on several occasion and always greeted with a friendly smile.
So far, this former wells fargo banker is quite pleased with compass!
Loyal customer and haven't had any problems with this bank
I opened my account about a year & a half ago.
When i was back on track, cristal r-soltero helped get another account up and going.
She had the best customer service i've experienced in a long time.
Love this bank and this location, which says a lot because i despise the big banking system in general.
I highly recommend the bank and location.
I really miss the us bank over by my old place of residence.
It was small, but nice and new inside, with friendly bank tellers who actually remembered who i was.
Now that this us bank is closer than that other one, i come here more often.
I had already deposited my money, but we both just got wrapped up in conversation!
It creeps me out at night when i have to stop here and take out money.
Easy to work with bank tellers.
Because of that great customer service i went ahead and signed up for a credit card!
Ok, i came for my auto loan here with debbie.
What can i say about this bank?
But, i have never had any problems with this bank...
This results in me driving around and actually thinking, did they move the bank?
The loans process is much easier here fa anywhere i've ever dealt with.
I joined truliant years ago primarily to obtain an car loan.
This branch of us bank is amazing.
That is customer service to its finest.
Awesome place to bank at.
I have been coming to this bank for over 6 years and never experienced a problem and not helped.
Customer service is great and i don't have to stress when i come here.
Meridian may not be an underdog in the true sense but in the banking world they certainly are.
Great friendly customer service provided even to someone who isn't a meridian customer.
This wells fargo location at decatur has provided great customer service to me and my family.
Other huntington bank branches vary widely in this respect.
We originally contacted a different agent to transfer our accounts and didn't appreciate the lack of excitement for our business.
Will definitely return for any banking needs.
Dawn and everyone in her office provide great service.
Our accounts and claims were always handled quickly and professionally.
This place is the best bank i have ever been to in my entire life.
The people that work here are so friendly and helpful- i almost forgot i was at a bank.
I have talked everybody i know into switching to this bank and they love it too!
Excellent customer service, immediate assistance as soon as i have walked in every time.
Offer free notary to anyone even if you don't have an account with wells fargo- awesome!
Handle name changes, account openings and notarizations so quickly!
I was very pleased with the service i received.
I have generally been pretty happy with us bank and was very satisfied with the extra time and attention.
A great credit union with good rates on loans.
They need to invest some money into making a better site for their customers.
My family and i have been with this bank and visited this branch for a decade now.
I would not trust another bank.
This was my bank and it always depended on the time of day you went!
They get an a ++ in customer service.
Good service and did not wait long at all, tellers were friendly each time i visited.
If you're counting money, doing something - fine, but at least tell me that your peer will be right w/me.
I'm not a fan of banks.
I started out by opening a checking account with them.
I was even able to transfer the money from my credit union account to fund it.
Once the checking account was processed and open, i applied online for a credit card.
Great customer service both times!
I still have my credit union account, but i'm a happy new bank customer!
I missed that when i closed down my other checking account with a major bank 7 years ago.
This credit union has great rates and customer service.
I plan to invest more and perhaps move my checking account here.
It should just be bank of "this state" and that be the end of it.
If you have to deal with this bank.. go to this one.
While they can be understaffed at time they do provide good customer service and are very helpful.
I've never had an issue banking here
This is the best bank i have worked with.
I go to this bank as a merchant and every single person that works here is amazing!!!
After everything was discussed she handed me her card, said to call her with any banking related questions.
So technically, i have like my own personal banker, i feel so grown and special!
I'm a small business owner and i use huntington for both my personal account as well as my business account.
I got the money within 6 weeks of signing up, it was awesome.
The bank itself is open later (i think til 7pm more nights) and it's open 7 days a week!
Every time i come in the customer service is excellent.
Whenever i have questions, i don't dread calling customer service for huntington.
So far, it's been an absoluttely great experience for both my small business account and my personal..
This branch also still has drive up teller service with the vacuum tubes.
I guess old banking practices and habits are hard to kill when it comes to dealing with personal finance.
As such, you have to expect to wait for services.
Besides the long lines and wait times, the service is top notch and delivered with care.
The tempe bank put a hold on my deposit and told me some bs excuse for why.
I appreciate your assistance and will continue to do business with this branch secondary to there exceptional customer service !
We've had savings accounts, car loans, etc.
My daughter just opened her first bank account.
We have an account here with the pto from my kids school i've been on as well.
Www banking has been perfect for me for a decade.
Thank you for all the great customer service!
So i left that day and drove to the nearest truliant and opened an account.
Since that time i've also taken a loan with truliant to pay for my school.
I find it's very difficult to navigate so making my loan payments has been rocky at best.
There are several compass bank around, but this branch is awesome.
The service is consistantly good.
Chase is too big and don't care about you but how much you have in your account.
I've been here a handful of times now for my banking transactions.
But nevertheless, i'll continue to banking here if i am in the area.
I've been banking at truwest and still early 1990s and they've always treated me great.
They have the usual options of accounts and they send out regular tips on how to manage your money.
They also have a decent online bill pay service and other online tools!
Credit unions don't charge the fees that banks charge because they are non-profit and here to serve you.
It is a full service location with 3 drive thrus, 1 drive up atm and an inside atm.
If you're looking for a change from banks or another credit union, check out truliant!
Friendly service and a good movie selection.
Good rates and good service.
They just helped me secure a vehicle loan for a client and it went as smooth as can be..
Thanks paula clark for that excellent level of service.
This is how i like a neighborhood bank to be.
Definitely beats bank of america.
Thanks for the great service.
This bank branch is right off of busy blue diamond, the speed is 55mph.
I am very pleased with the service i received at this branch.
This chase bank is outstanding!
Their customer service is always very pleasant.
I think this may be the best banking location i have ever 'banked' with!
I'm not a big fan of banks.
It's sad when a machine is faster, nicer and more efficient than the bank tellers inside.
The loan process was super easy, and everyone was very friendly.
Definitely will come back for other banking needs!
Thank you josh for your stellar customer service, and the laughs.
I am very pleased with the service and quality of the work performed.
I've banked with them for years.
I wanted to thank leigh for her excellent customer service.
I would recommend ibew and all the services they offer.
Leigh qualified me to refinance my auto loan saving me thousands!!!!
Anmar's service is fast and courteous.
Just had the worst customer service with b of a holes again.
Can't wait to have enough time off to move all my accounts from b of turd to here
Go see her for your banking needs and you'll absolutely be satisfied!
Now i can use this extra monthly savings to help pay down other debts.
She help my nephew and i open up his first bank account.
Because of her genuine service i will only be visiting this branch.
Great customer service and very modern technology.
I have savings and an auto loan here.
I may switch all accounts to omega.
This is my primary bank, since it's so close to my house and convenient.
I've always had decent service here.
Arrive at least 15 minutes before closing time to exchange money.
Great example to what customer service should be all about.
Quick and customer-service friendly.
This is my favorite bank to go to.
I've never had an issue with any of the bankers or tellers.
Come in and get a checking or savings account, or take out a personal loan.
I've done a lot of banking here.
Honestly, if you're banking somewhere else, you're probably also high on crack.
Do your banking here.
I have been banking with boa for a long time.
I had to come to this bank center to get money out.
I do belgrave thus bank is above average.
My checking account and savings account are through them.
They're doing all right for me, as far as big, corporatized banks go.
It's pretty nice of them and it's a nice change from hearing about how bad banks are.
At least the employees at the banks can make you feel happy about coming somewhere to put your monies!
I've always had exceptional service at tfcu.
I also bought a vehicle in march 2018,  using cuabs, their credit union auto buying service.
The customer service has been top-notch!!!
It's a pawn store so i'm ranking this place by selection, price, service, and flexibility.
Service is lacking but generally good for what it is: a pawn store.
Inside you have your typical bank - tellers and personal bankers.
I was at this location to close out my wells fargo account.
But overall service was excellent.
Also, bank of arizona has atm's in every qt gas station!
Henrietta is an awesome personal banker at america first.
She set up my account with a debit card, checking, savings and a temporary card in under a half hour.
She exemplifies customer service and professionalism.
The people at huntington bank go out of their way to help.
First class service, the best pricing(who doesn't like unlimited processing for only $39.99) and i love my clover device.
This agency is all about service!
Very pleased with the services we receive from bmo harris bank.
We love our primary banker and the entire team is proactively helpful in a variety of ways.
Their international services are particularly helpful for my business and most of the companies i work with.
His office provides fast, prompt, accurate, and friendly customer service.
Our senior loan officer was fiona grant.
I would definitely use fiona and southern fidelity again and would highly recommend their services.
I don't mind waiting but 3hrs to open a account is crazy peeps.
Didn't know you need to schedule banking transactions.
This rep knows customer service!
I just might transition my other accounts.
I always use this drive thru for my banking and never have any problems.
Quick service and friendly staff
The bank manager, eslam, was extremely helpful with some docs i had to have notarized.
Out of the all bank of americas this one stands out!
Still not a big fan of all the banking fees they hit me with, but the staffs great.
And close to chase and wells fargo bank.
Get all bills and banking done at once.
Able to answer questions about loans.
Ive deposited a lot of checks in a lot of different banks and never had that happen.
I love bank of america.
My daughter and i have banked with other banks and have had multiple problems.
Since we have been with boa (2 yrs) we are extremely happy with our banking services.
Lori is all about customer service, management seems nice.
Like this bank location.
I can get my grocery shopping and bank needs done.
I've only dealt with them once and it was when i opened a savings account for my daughter.
Really nice and smooth transaction for car loans!
This chase has the best customer service!
She also helped me with banking and investment accounts.
A lot of experience with banks in many cities, east to west coast.)
You don't get that at chase and you most certainly do not get that at bank of america.
I realize it's a bank, but it's simply a nice place to visit.
I found that wells fargo bank seemed to be best for me and my needs.
It seems as if now a days banks are in love with charging their customers fees, fees, fees!
With the account that i had opened, there are no monthly maintenance fees.
The overall service was just okay.
The offset to this of course was that there were no loan costs whatsoever.
Save ur money :) the staff at boa are always happy to see you!
Recently joined this bank chain at the sahara-decatur location.
There's a considerable wait, especially to work with a banker.
Actually i have no words to express how rusty helped me for the home loan process!
I called so many different banks and mortgage broker for loan.
I almost give up keep finding for loan until i found rusty on yelp.
Friendly staff, always a pleasure to go here and do my banking.
Personal bankers are always available.
I left the big banks and my only regret is that i didn't do it sooner.
I receive personal attention that i never got from the big banks.
We are refinancing (i prefer to call it "firing' bank of america.)
Kim, loan consultant, has made the process simple and seamless.
Banking at the boulder dam credit union truly is a "wonderful life!"
I've checked in enough times, i really should write a review for this bank.
I just finished signing loan documents this morning with leilani.
Still, staff is friendly and they are knowledgeable in the products and service that they provide.
This is my normal branch that i bank at - as closest to my house.
I truly appreciate banking somewhere where the staff doesn't treat you like a number
I have been banking here since i moved and they are always so friendly and helpful.
Friendly and helpful staff and great service.
I would recommend them over any of the big banking institutions!
I completely understand the one star rating with this terrible bank.
I went to this bank location today to get a check reissued and the staff was very friendly and effective.
I definitely recommend this branch to anyone who banks with wells fargo.
I highly recommend this money exchange  service location in downtown toronto to any tourist.
I was really satisfied with their service since all the sings were posted clearly and easy to read.
They are great with helping find that right merchant service solution and are affordable.
Fantastic customer service at the windows.
I have banked with them for over a year and they are great.
I like the checking account they offer and they have good rates on loans.
How can you not give this bank a 5-star?
It opens on sunday, most banks don't.
It extend their business hours mondays thru fridays, most banks don't.
I wasn't up for the bank due to being incredibly sleep deprived, but everyone was so friendly.
Been banking here for years.
I really love this bank.
I trust them with my money and financing.
If you need to do any business with the bank of america, i would recommend this branch.
Nothing spectacular, but are you expecting spectacular from a bank?
When i have gone  inside, lines were short and service was good.
No bankers in the office to manage accounts.
Extremely knowledgeable, great customer service, super friendly.
I have all my accounts here and i always have fast and efficient results with them.
She helped me refinance my cars and saved me  a ton of money.
He was helpful and honest about the loan process.
Amazing location where the staff treats you like an old friend just for being a member of their bank.
Will lewis went above and beyond to provide top notch service.
I would like to thank ms. marika jacyla for excellent service.
You're going to charge me $2 just for the privilege of accessing my own checking account?
And other big banks soon followed suit saying they'd also look at charging debit usage fees for their customers.
On the whole, the credit unions are structured very similarly to the banks except in terms of scale.
My biggest concern with joining a credit union was about access to my accounts.
In terms of the banking experience itself, i've had nothing but positive experiences with desert schools branches.
There is always only 1 banker at all times waited 25  minutes to open an account i finally just left!!!
Their customer service is top notch and their friendly staff always makes me feel welcome.
Wish they would change that so i won't have to take my money elsewhere.
For both personal and business banking, this is a great and fast branch.
But, it's a busy bank and they have to live with the property design.
Wow he helped me get new bank cards.
What a beautiful old bank with a beautiful old building on top of it.
Not a lot of people actually bank here but the building itself is definitely worthy of the star rating.
I have a premium investment account with chase and i f***ing love it.
Stopped in for a business banker without an appointment.
Great first impression of customer service!
In the future when i go to this bank i am always going to ask for him.
I've been using bank of arizona for over 1.5 years now for my small business.
I think i opened my account with $50 and have never been charged a fee.
High school checking accounts here for my kids.
We were very happy with the customer service that he provided.
The next day we went into the bank and met with oscar garcia personal banker.
I only wish all banks had employees that our passionate about excellent customer service.
Keep up the great service!
If you don't trust the banks like me this is the place to go!
Walking into their office is always a pleasant experience for us and their customer service exceeds expectations every time.
We will recommend your services to all our friends and family.
Sunwest has been my bank of choice for the last 15 years!
I also like that you have several different options when it comes to managing your accounts.
I will continue to use their service for a long time.
Most banks are out of safety deposit boxes but who cares i found what i was looking for!
I tried to get my own bank to match their offer first and they couldn't touch it.
My mortgage payment changed only slightly and i went from a 30 to a 20 year loan.
My wife and i have our personal accounts here, and i have my business account with midfirst as well.
I'm from out of state and i often use this branch as it part of the shared branch credit service.
I've always had great customer service and easy withdrawal and processing of bank needs.
The service is great.
It's hard for any bank to get 5 star in my book, but i was pretty impressed with rbc bank.
First of all - free checking - how many banks still do that?!?!
That was what lured me to rbc bank.
So i closed it and went in search of a free checking account.
Like most things i do, i opened an account online.
She invited me to come in to get my online banking set up.
I normally would be wary of such a call because i generally like to interact with bank's websites.
If it wasn't for the minorly irritating online account opening process, this bank would have earned 5 stars from me.
And i can't think of the last time i would have felt that way about any other bank.
A great alternative to the big banks and all those fees.
Very good bank... no fees for most services!
This bank has it's act together.
If wells fargo is not your bank it should be.
I really was frustrated from the delay that i got for the money wiring, it took like a month.
I honestly did not get any refund of the wiring, but requested the money to be back.
When i needed accurate answers and prompt service, mark and his staff was perfect.
2) the three rules of banking never applied: convenience, cost, and care.
My old bank, although with tons of branches spread out everywhere, was never convenient.
The costs associated with the accounts were exorbitant and they raised my credit card interest rate to 38% "just because".
And nobody new my name after years of banking at the same branch.
Big plus for us bank: current and former united states military service members receive "platinum checking" at no charge.
A bank open on sunday!
Started banking here about 3 years ago after having numerous experiences with the big banks.
Not only is the service excellent; but the attitude and the smiles are genuine.
Fyi- if you want to open a check or savings account it's by appointment only!
Opened a savings account for my daughter on friday.
Personal bank assistant was claudia.
Additional info: they offer a high school checking accounts with many options.
My daughter walked out with a planner & money in the bank to start her future!
Service has always been pleasant and polite, as you'd expect from any other td branch.
I have never waited more than 5 minutes to speak to a banker.
Call 'em a big impersonal corporate bank if you like, but this branch has it right.
Saved me from spending a ton o money on a fake rolex.
Good customer service and solid credit union.
Personal banker bettyanne is awesome, she always follows up and is very easy going.
Amazing customer service and response time .
I have been using this bank over 15 years now.
Best customer service ever, i would recommend this bank over any other, because it is member owned.
Great customer service, always helpful, security protection 100%.
Needed to open up a new account.
Their service is excellent and prompt.
Overall, a solid visit to the bank.
First off, i want to compliment beau for his exceptional customer service.
(52nd and roosevelt) but what impressed me the most was the services that truwest offers.
They did a great job on getting me home loan.
I was very happy with their service.
Zach over at chase bank has truly and continues to be amazing.
Awesome lending institutions and amazing service zach turner has provided me.
Great guest service and great loan rates.
Beautiful design, fast efficient service and good saving products.
This isn't a review about chase's checking or savings account options.
The bank is big, clean, and well lit.
I needed a safe deposit box so i went to my bank.
I on the other hand, bank with a credit union.
Because the credit unions are owned by credit union account holders.
I have a confession, i have an rbc account too.
However they do ensure just as great security and accounts that are competitive/affordable.
Have not had a service problem at any of the truwest locations in five plus years.
I can't say enough about this bank.
They used to be mainly a business bank but branched out to consumer.
Customer service is top notch.
Lena got me all set up with accounts and a safe deposit box.
The personal service and eagerness to go above and beyond in every way has be very loyal to this bank.
I love banking with dsfcu.
I do enjoy coming to this banking center.
I prefer using the drive-thru atms, because this bank has them updated to deposit cash and checks, with no envelopes!
My husband went to this bank by referral thru several co-workers in feb 2018.
He was helped by a banker named estela.
She went over the car loan application thoroughly and it was quick and easy.
A few months later i decided to apply for a car loan as well and was pre-approved.
I procrastinated purchasing a car so my loan expired.
Kudos to estela for an excellent customer service!!!
I highly recommend her to help anybody with their loan needs.
Best customer service i've experienced in the fifteen years i've owned a business.
Every individual at this bank provides​ sterling, knowledge service.
I highly recommend his services.
Great, friendly, super fast customer service & they have a drive-thru!
You get personalized service like you're some big wig with tons of money even if you aren't.
The can do everything a big bank can, except they have more limited hours/locations.
I can guarantee you no big bank would do that!
So, the limitations are far outweighed by the great customer service i get from almost everyone there.
After losing patience of waiting for my bank to make one available for me i decided to rent one there.
Very nice customer service and great security.
The customer service was awesome too.
My bank of america visits here average to 3 stars.
One star for the visits i have to withdraw money or pay toward a credit card payment.
Five stars for the visits i deposit money or cash a check.
It is an ok bank.
It tends to get more crowded causing a longer wait time than other local bank of america branches.
When it comes to banking i use the branch near me.
As long as i have a bank account, i will most likely return.
A great company and very pleasant customer service.
We've banked here for 2 years.
I can't see myself going to any other bank again thus far.
I do not have a account here but needed proof of an auto loan i paid off years ago.
The customers service  girl was right on it !!!
Thank you customer service girl !!
Have had sooooo many very bad experiences  with banks over the years especially  wells ago.
Get far away from banks then run!
Shawn is truly amazing at his job and provides outstanding customer service.
I was in florida at the time on a long term assignment, hundreds of miles from a keybank.
I called the customer service number and within a few hours all my money was back in my account.
Miss this bank, big time.
Shana great service thanks, clean laundry great that open 24 hours...will come again.
They are open 24hrs and offer same day service, dry cleaning, wash&fold.
Great bank all the staff is super friendly and professional.
However, (other than erin) the service here is frustrating.
Great location to avoid personal banking investing line ups.
This is for the credit card department of chase bank.
They call to make sure it is not we who are charging these item and close the account right then.
________________________________________________ customer service is not helpful.
Money in the account and the card was declined.
Called customer service to find out what block was on the account or what transactions needed to be verified.
This bank is better than the one located on green valley but they are seriously understaffed.
Extremely friendly, helpful staff on hand to assist with questions while he washes loads for full-service customers.
Open account and new credit card at navy federal today.
Service was awesome, good product line good interest rates.
I can't tell you how many times this bank has been here for me.
It's my local bank and i frequent this location a lot for my personal needs.
During open hours, bankers are always happy to help me.
This secu has no drive-through banking!!!
The building looks like your typical eighties era bank with a ugly, blocky exterior.
All the basic banking is done downstairs, and any special banking needs have to be taken care of upstairs.
This bank is conveniently located near uptown charlotte, dilworth, midtown, and elizabeth.
And with banks, convenience, not aesthetics, is what matters.
She's always checking up on me, and catching things for me.
I am writing this note as a humble appreciation for the outstanding customer service provided by kayla.
Low to no fees, and great customer service..
Twice one of their atms's ate my money, and didn't count the cash deposit..
So i was stuck all weekend with no money, and absolutely no one to call about it until monday.
Not having a 24 hour customer service number is unacceptable in a town like las vegas.
Jennifer is the reason i started an account here instead of using my shared branching.
Haven't been in the bank proper though.
I love this bank!
For gilbert wells fargo banks...
This is my 1st choice because of the customer service & no pressure banking.
Other banks are pushy about signing up for credit cards, savings accounts and who knows what else...
But not this bank.
Great customer service, going above and beyond over any other banks in the neighborhood!
Glad to bank here and recommend them..
I have been with this location when it was founder's bank.
I'm not a business owner, nor do i have tons of money in my accounts.
The money museum here is one of the hidden gems of cleveland.
You get a free sample of shredded money after your visit, $2.5 billion a year of cash is shredded here!
Great option for the regular more pricier service offered on the hotels.
Fast, convenient and accurate service...isnt that what its all about?
Bank manager elisa, david, and their team members were super awesome in taking care of my needs!!
I just wish i could do more atm banking with cash and check deposits at places in my neighborhood.....
They also offer a lot of atm services so that you can skip waiting in the long teller line.
Which is the reason i have been banking with them for over 10 years.
It was late sunday night of a three-day weekend, banks are closed until tuesday,  i live 2000 miles away.
She takes care of my insurance for my cars, home, life and business as well as some retirement accounts.
Make sure you get your parking pass validate when you visit the bank.
All the bank employees are friendly and very polite and they all know exactly what they are doing.
I would definitely recommend this cu if you are new to the area and/or need a good loan rate.
When you withdraw money from them, you do not get charged a fee for it.
Arizona business bank is a great place to do your banking.
Thanks arizona business bank for doing a great job!!!
I wish i could give you 10 stars  for being an awesome bank.
The people who complain must not to go the bank often lol
I've never enjoyed banks...really never.
If you're sick of the major banks and the total lack of customer service, give this place a try.
I've never been able to say i was happy with my bank until the last year.
She gave me the info to try to resolve my money that got jammed inside the atm.
At that  time she pointed out the tiny sign near where u deposit your money saying only 25 bills.
My saving grace after being in a bad mood to begin with was sandy!
My sister also banks with you.
Walking into truwest , i got partnered with a banker named christina, she was amazing.
Best bank in bellevue.
Being the only bank near the strip they should be fully staffed.
Brittany (banker) was hands down amazing and beyond helpful with helping me set up my new checking and savings account.
Rigo  (manager) introduced himself to me and showed how much he truly did care about me and my account.
Hands down the best experience i have ever had with a bank and their employees
And if you need a bank i would highly recommend here!
Unlike other reviews, i didn't have any issues with this bank's customer service or professionalism.
My interactions were very brief, however, and limited to the bankers at their desks and not the tellers.
The banker i worked with was very friendly and professional.
Great service from juan jose!!
Definitely great customer service.
Fluff and fold service is the best!
They offer same-day wash & fold services (usual turn around is between 2.5-3 hours) and are open 24/7!
They also offer dry-cleaning services.
Not the lowest in town, but definitely the best value for quality service.
I will never go anywhere else to bank not even another us bank.
I couldn't be more pleased with the service we received at this branch.
We setup both corporate and personal accounts and jenna helped us over several days to get everything perfect.
I do miss the people that were their when i first started banking with them, but shit happens.
They also offer the state farm banking and personal liability insurance.
Its people like corey that keeps us coming back to this bank to do our business with.
Linda woodford is always on top of her game when it comes to helping with loans and other financial services.
We all enjoyed learning about the history of money.

Not like other bank there so rude.
Thank you for the long time services you have provided us cccu.

Everytime i come here the service is fast, friendly, and efficient.
Bank has helped me with personal loans and my car loans with not so perfect credit.
Anyway, the service here was good.
I banked with tcf for roughly 5 years while i lived in arizona.

I didn't go inside so can't tell you much about the customer service at this time.

Another new-to-me car, another hassle free loan from azfcu.
The only real drawback is that i can't pay the loan online.
Well, at least not from another bank account, my regular checking account is with chase.
On their website, all you can do is check your loan balance and make a payment from another azfcu account.
I have maintained an account with wachovia (now wells fargo) for many years.
To their credit, the bank called me.
***   the second incidence of unknowns accessing my checking account was early 2011.
I once again received a call from the bank.
The customer service rep who assisted me was an angel.
Curious, i asked her how someone had gotten into my account.
She said it looked like someone had most likely accessed my debit card and not my actual bank account.
After this incident,  i set up banking alerts.
Now i get notifications when all sorts of activities occur with my accounts.
Sheesh, if they gave me a tootsie roll, i'd think i was back home at long island savings bank!

The savings account was opened because we wish to not touch this $.
Ricky montanez was my loan officer recently.
He spent so much time explaining my options and helping me with my loan.

It has many teller windows, and have 5-6 banking staff.

I had to wait about 10 minutes until the teller went back to the customer service office.
I switched to arizona central from a big national bank 9 years ago, and i love it so much more.
The customer service is more personal, and they don't hit you with tons of unnecessary fees.
The service here is excellent.
If you're looking for a bank with excellent customer service this is the place to go to!
Thus club got the job done and didn't break our bank.
Close to the strip for all those who don't want to spend additional money on atm fees!
This bank is down the street from my house and is my go to bank.
The central phoenix location is great and the setup for investors and banking is really easy.
So prior to my membership with onenevada i was with one of those major banks.

Keep up the nice service!!
It makes me so happy to know that they care about helping me, and understand that money can be stressful.
Every time i go in, i get lexie she's awesome with customer service and interacts with her customers.
I give you my money, and you take it with a smile.

All banks are not created equal.
For a bank called first convenience my experience opening an account online has been anything but.
This bank was recommended by my mother and things started smoothly but right after opening the account, trouble started.
Finally getting through all of this i noticed that my account balance was at $0.00.
I called customer service and asked why $100.00 i opened the account with was not present.
Finally 6 days later it came through to the new account.
Amazing service and very comfortable place to go to.
I came to this branch to open a checking account.
I mistakenly posted a review of bank of america here instead of the b of a site.

Excellent service, very friendly, always helpful.
Customer service is great.
Nice and clean inside, friendly teller, quick service in and out.

The staff was second to none in customer service and patience.
I would recommend contacting mr. schneider if you need a loan of any type.
I went in there today for a money order.
Tell me why the clerk told me there's a $5 charge for the freaking money order?!
Basically you can buy a lot of things w/ $5 instead of spending it on a dang money order.

And with better rates than a bank you cannot go wrong!

I had to fix something in one of my accounts and jeanette was thoughtful, thorough, and on point.
On the other hand, the other banker joe was also patient and efficient.
I've always received great customer service from the flagstaff and chandler branches.
However i've started going to this branch and the customer service is mediocre.
I love working with gateway bank!
A community, local bank is the way to go.

Banking can be unpleasant and stressful unless you've got people on your side who want to help you succeed.
I highly recommend gateway bank for your everyday, or business banking.
I have a decent amount in my savings however my credit is horrible.
Got a loan within 25 minutes i highly recommend.
Maybe that explains the complete lack of lines to do my banking!
This is a business bank, so you won't hear the ubiquitous "how's it going?"
Instead, your banking will be done quickly and professionally, leaving you to make the day your own.

Usually have really long waits but has a separate line for business accounts.

Unlike the other reviewer that mentioned sunwest, a different lender approved my loan.
At no point did dave contact me and put pressure on closing the loan.
( in order to close the loan, all trusts have to be removed.)
They had some great displays about the history of money and the fed.
Best part was the free money* available at the end of the tour.

I also have an auto loan here that gave me a lower rate than my main bank by 5 percent.
I like pnc bank as it is a real people friendly bank.
I love coming to this bank!
I highly recommend the bank and this branch!
However, after some time, things got back on track and i paid off my loan.
Things went well and i felt good about using their services again.
Probably the wells fargo bank in las vegas that i hit the most.
I rarely need to go inside the bank unless i have to transfer money to someones account.
In actuality, these people are saying they need to get money from an automated teller machine machine.
The bank itself is well maintained and bright.
Wonderful service with an awesome staff!
Anyways, they have "free-ish" business checking, except for these dumb fees.
Everyone at this bank is so helpful!

I have been using nevada state bank for a non-profit for which i serve as treasurer.
The customer service and ease of using online tools have been fantastic.
Our service was prompt, professional and affordable.
A bit out of the way for my taste, but the ease of banking with them always brings me back.
They have 2 atm's out between the postal service side and the branch itself.
Due to illness i had to take over my parents accounts at nsb.
I'm so thankful for her and would recommend her branch to anyone looking for that small bank experience.
They offered me a great deal on my auto loan  refinancing.

Ok, so how do you give a review of a bank, let alone a good one?
"oh why don't you go and bank yourself" or "i got totally bank-faced last night!"
This is a new bank, clean and simple, chock full of young and keen staff.
They have an open door policy with their account managers so there generally isn't a need to book ahead.
The tellers are mostly keen to be there and the account managers always have a smile on their face!
If you live or work in the beltline, it's time to change banks!
I use them exclusively for their wash and fold service.
This establishment also offers self service laundry machines and dry cleaning.
Shana gave awesome service!
The flamingo branch is my regular banking location.
Ive been banking with onenevada since 2013 and only recommend them to....everyone.
Reasonable rates, easy free online access and allpoint atms are what keep me banking here.
Very friendly and has the best customer service ever.
The machine gave me the money i needed so i was more the pleased!
I have never been to a bank where they work thru the line so quickly.
The service is beyond friendly and the staff is always attentive and eager to help.
I know that sounds kind of crazy but i miss some of the conveniences you have with a larger bank.
This bank has plenty of parking but is difficult to get to because of the divided road.
I have had accounts with other banks, and nfcu is by far the best.
They have great customer service and have helped me out with any financial issues.
I went in today to get approved for a loan to consolidate everything.
Great service, great people.
Also can't beat their interest rates for loans.
It is a bank and it is the main branch.

This has been one of my banks for about 5 years.
We do all our banking with desert schools and have been very pleased.
On july 25 we switched our auto loans there so we can have everything with them.
We have been with desert schools since we've moved here and been very happy with the service of this branch.
I opened both checking and savings account online using their website.
According to the representative, i had ten days to add funds to both accounts.
Good thing i had the money or both accounts would have closed down.
I've been to dozens of bank of america locations, but this one has the best service by far.
Great customer service he is a keeper!!?
When i went in to open my new accounts i was assisted by the branch manager.
I'm glad i selected this branch to bank with.
Also, they offered me the best interest rate compared to the other banks wanting my business.
The hotel sent us to a ghetto neighborhood originally in which we were approached by thugs asking for money.
Clean facility, safe neighborhood and great service.
Starting out slow and getting the hookah service was a great way to start.

Julio is very knowledgeable about many of boa products and services.
Best customer service you'll find at a financial institution!!
I can only speak for the tailoring service, so take that into consideration on this review.
The drinks are expensive, so save your money and give it to the girls.
I first found out about pinnacle mortgage solutions on the bankrate website.
The best part of the whole experience, of course, was the rock bottom settlement charges for a loan over $400k.
I have used both their fluff and fold and dry cleaning services and have never had one.
Services are completed in a timely manner and at a great price.
Plus you can't beat the 24 hour service!
I had a very straightforward refinance with excellent credit and a loan amount less than 60% of the appraised value.
Pinnacle will not actually be servicing my loan, so it is yet to be seen how well that goes.
(note to the wise, don't put money in your mouth, it was probably in someone's vajay.)
The amount of services provided by this credit union is astonishing.
It truly is a one stop shop for all your banking needs and then some.
What really impressed us was the service we were provided by teller gina and branch manager ron.
The wonderful lady that help me open my new account she was witty and quick, i honestly enjoyed my visit.
Evan pierce, the loan officer that helped me with my auto loan, was absolutely amazing.
I submitted an online application and he called me less than 5 minutes later to start finalizing the loan.
It only took 10 minutes to sign my loan documents and get the check.
Travis helped me open my savings account to become a member, and he was also wonderful!
Overall, i've had a great experience with cccu and i highly recommend them for their rates and customer service.
Today was a pleasant visit when my parents and i had some banking to do.
The advisor helped us with our banking pleasantly and was friendly.
You can get rid of all your coins for free and it goes directly into your bank account.
They understand you just want to take care of your banking needs and go.
It has that small bank feeling, but has speedy service.
I like not having to exchange money for a bunch of quarters.
The first time i was in there, i was opening a checking and savings account.
Another time i came by, was to open an account for my son's birthday.
Being only one one year old, i need to be the one controlling the account.
She even linked my account to his so i could transfer straight to it.
What great customer service!
Laudry service is 5, place is just 2
Yes yes and yes.. so duhhhhh switched the accounts that we had.. that is the business side.
Thank you for the excellent services.
I wanted to patronize this bank about year ago when i moved her.
The people who bank here seem to enjoy the experience.
I now have a relationship here and i will experience what the service is like.
My 1st impression is this is a credit union stretching to conduct itself as a bank.
The only advice i would share with the bank is customer service.
But what makes a company stronger is good customer service.
The lady who served me was polite just needs basic customer service training.
They're full service too, which is cool.
Definitely the #1 bank in my opinion.
Well read the other reviews of this bank.
I have been in here several times and always had good customer service.
As an adult, it is the only place i'd prefer to keep my money.
Ive had one nevada as my bank since my first paycheck.
They only require $5 to open a savings account, have great loan rates and very friendly employees.
Incredibly helpful customer service.
Really friendly and great customer service.
I know, at first sight you may think: a money museum!!
I made my own money both electronically and with paper and crayon.
The best one is probably the bag of shredded money.
Nevada state bank itself, i'm starting not to care for.
Hense me banking w/them now for 4+ years and counting...
But the entire process was quick and efficient, and service was provided by friendly staff.
Money changers exchange paper money for quarters.
You just don't get that level of service at most places, let alone banks.
Wish i had this level of service back home!
The service provided was quick.
Macu is a great credit union to bank with.
They always have great low rates on everything from auto loans to credit cards.
Thank you for your service here in the neighboring laundromat.
This bank is not the easiest bank to deal with.
My account has been open less than a month and there has been nothing but issues.
She also helped me at 4:30 after i got off work when the bank closed at 5.
I went in to start up a new checking account last week and sat with josie r. she was amazing!
Stephanie is the best thing to happen to this branch and any bank.
I have never had a bank experience like this before.
I'm usually not a fan of "big banks" but stephanie has made the transition smooth as butter.
There's a drive up atm and when i need services inside the staff is always friendly and smiling.
I have been banking with mountain america for 5 years now.
I use them for everything from car loans to home loans to general banking.
Cleveland is my fifth in my quest to "collect" all of the federal reserve banks.
I been here few times where i had to interact with tellers, loan offices and branch manager.
So far i have had pretty good experience as far as service goes.
We opened our son an account.
I told her i was messing up her income and excused myself so she could get that money.
Just remember that when you come get it's get that money from everyone you encounter.
Not only is this building breathtaking, it is also an amazing place to learn about the history of money.
I needed this, as i was disoriented by the decided un-bank-like appearance inside.
My family loves how it feels more like a small town bank.
I had an issue with an old account and a new deposit coming to that old account.
Travis then went out his way to call me when my account was approved to be opened.
All this happened in two days for my long overdue return to hit my account.
Friendly and fast service.
Wow i have been banking since this was washington mutual years back and he was right.
The facility is clean and has all the amenities and the service is excellent.
I've had my boa/amex credit card for decades and have always gotten great service.
Very nice gal and i could tell immediately she had great customer service.
What 5 star service!
I've actually been told by customer service reps at utility, airline, medical, credit card companies, etc.
They have good rates on loans, etc..
Liz & kevin worked hard to earn the business and provide exceptional customer service.
Best customer service i've never had.
However, a banker "nick" helped me patiently and i could leave this branch with a smile.
We financed our new vehicle and had outstanding customer service with richie smith.
So glad my husband and i decided to leave the traditional banks and go the credit union path.
I came in just looking for information to refinance my auto loan .
Jackie martin was so helpful that i even filled out an application to apply for a new loan.
I look forward to coming back to open a new account with jackie.
The service was great.
So almost at the end of the closing day, the loan went through.
But i have to stress that service was great.
He worked efficiently and professionally to try to get my loan approve with the lender.
We were opening a number of accounts and made me glad we are doing business with chase.
Great service and friendly staff!
I enjoy visiting this location for all of my banking needs.
Bank of america offers great options for everyone from savings accounts to home loans.
For helping us with our new home loan.
I'd highly recommend using cccu for your next home loan, refi, and financial needs.
They lend u money.
I wouldn't really want to bank anywhere else.
I recently opened an account with pnc, and the process was easy.
They walked me through step-by-step in selecting which accounts would benefit me the most.
I have been with nevada state bank for over 12 years now.
I have both my business and personal accounts here, as well as my car loan.
Soo annoying , either you can't deposit or you can't withdraw money out .
Great bank, believe it was the newest bank in fountain hills.
Opened an account at credit union and it was free!
They have a atm for after hours banking and they're next to my favorite frozen yogurt place in downtown summerlin.
Michael did a great job at getting us a home loan quickly.
Beautiful historical chase bank location.
I had dreams about this bank as a kid.
This is a locally-based community bank in south charlotte that really focuses on customer service.
My friend has a business account here and i have been on several occasions to make deposits for him.
I am seriously considering switching all of my accounts over from the big bank i currently use.
All in all, if you are looking for a smaller bank with more personal service, you should check them out.
I explained my concern and position on a problem i had with my account.
I had a wonderful experience at this bank.
Needed a bank draft but my home branch is up north.
They gladly helped me obtain a bank draft, and were pleasant and funny.
I love it when a banker respects my time and my business.
I waited at the door until they opened, promptly and needed to open another account.
Very friendly and customer service is key!
The team has a lot to offer their customer in loan and personal finance help.
It took chase less than 30 days to accomplish what us bank couldn't do in 4 months.
Unlike us bank, chase's loan process is efficient and not run by a bunch of idiots.
Also, every time i have banking needs and questions, they're always available to help and answer
A low rate and a huge savings too, thank you.
We cannot day enough about maximum title loans.
For a person with no income, i sure spend a lot of time at the bank.
Something even funnier than that is, this isn't my primary bank.
Being able to do so, without an account here, makes me happy.
And smiling helpful faces make me even happier, while i place their money in my purse.
Best banking staff i have ever come in contact with.
Opening an account is easy.
The staff is pleasant although i think truliant has better customer service.
The issue i had with sharonview is not with this branch but the credit union's bill pay service.
It took 5 days for my car payment to make it to one of the big 3 banks.
I have had car loans, home mortgage loans,  equity loans, and personal loans, as well as savings products with them.
I am still with desert schools through branch banking and never plan to change.
Overall services was great.
I would definitely recommend banking with one nevada!
This bank is ok.
Huge bank....and i'm not a huge company fan.
I like service and wf tends to drop the ball here.
So if you are a prospective buyer in need of loan please do not hesitate to call david or danielle.
Friendly service and a speedy drive-thru!
Already having pnc accounts separately made it super easy to just have a joint account added for us.
I enjoy the personalized service you receive.
Just by banking there i get additional discounts at other business.
Educated me on my finances and help me set up a savings plan to get back on track.
This is a killer bank in general, but this branch takes service to a whole new level.
The company should model its service ideals around this location and britney especially.
Overall great union to bank with!
See paul t. for your personal banking needs.
I always have a great time speaking with the bank tellers.
Not a bad bank..
Would recommend if your trying to repair/build credit, start with a checking account from one nevada credit union!
Thank you very much for helping us switch from safeco and saving us $884 a year.
Of note recently, i used their mortgage specialist, jon dedeaux & relationship banker, jillian james.
Both gave excellent, professional, knowledgeable service, were available for appointments and efficient at their specialties.
Thank you to both for the time spent assisting me with my various banking needs.
The employees here are friendly and go over and above with their customer service.
I cannot tell you how much i appreciate her personal service - especially in the very middle of christmas.

I will continue banking here probably forever!

But the service that latoya gave me was phenomenal!
Just from her great service is the reason why i rate this branch 5 stars.
I highly recommend this credit union to anyone looking to get a loan or have a checking account.
Much better than any bank in town.
Citi bank is hands down one of the best banks in vegas.
Other major banks want to charge you fees left and right.
This is the best bank i've ever been with.
I've never seen or heard of any other bank that will take care of their customers like this.
We love the personal touch rather than just being a number at a big bank.
Any fees are minimal in comparison to other banks.
I have been banking with them for about ten years.
I bank with wells fargo, so any branch is fine with me.
I love doing all my business banking at this chase branch.
Christian, one of the private client banker's, is more than accommodating and is a great guy to work with.
Got our new box opened, questions answered and friendly service.
This is my sunday bank.
I bank with wells, the staff are friendly and speedy.
I had an issue with my account before as the wrong type was set up for me at the bank.

Service is good at this location.

Very friendly staff, fast service and no waiting.
This is really the only us bank branch that i use.
Friendly, but didn't follow my deposit instruction which i didn't realize until the next night when i checked my account.
Still, there's a chance they may offer better deposit and loan rates than the big banks.
I really like the idea of a credit union versus a bank.
Customer service is really helpful in person and i like that they have extended hours at some locations.
They offer competitive rates for car and home loans too.
I really would recommend america first credit union for your banking needs.
I got my bank draft without issue and for only $7.50.
Bank of america....there when you need them.
When you get frustrated with big banking try the clark county credit union.
Very happy and thanks full for the service
Actually i do not belong to this bank, but my husband does.
I've been banking here for over 3 years and have not had any problems.
There weren't many banks that fit this description.
We earn a little interest on our accounts, but we don't keep huge balances over a few thousand.
Didn't count any money to do this.
Honestly, we love this bank.
They have great services for what we need.
Every wells fargo has amazing service!
I work at a competitor bank and know good banking service!
Well maybe that's the problem they have one banker helping everyone.

When i opened my account, they pushed the credit card.

He keeps you informed with your loan and closing went smoothly.

By far the best bank i have visited!
I felt like i got an amazing price and amazing customer service.
Working with josie updating our accounts.
We have been banking with one nevada since 1982, of course we are very happy with them!
Avoiding the lake wobegon effect in rating banks as we all know banks are a dime a dozen.
I am so happy with the service i received and look forward to my future with citibank!
I love banking with you guys!!!
Yeah, i know i'm reviewing a bank.

Josh and andy are always helpful and unlike every other bank they turnover is low.
Granted from your everyday loan places i actually really liked this one when i borrowed in august.
If you need a bank in the area this one for sure knows what customer service is!
There is also a sitting area for kids or seniors while you are doing your banking.
I have my business accounts here for years.
Dealing with bank of nevada is ten times better than dealing with bank of america!
This was our first joint account after getting married about a year ago.
We both had visa debit checking cards within five minutes of coming inside the bank.
I love the services offered by one nevada and the great interest rates they offer etc.
Friendly service every time and i love the drive-thru atm.
It takes pictures of your cash and check deposits and adds the funds to your account quickly.
I've been banking with them for 8 years and they are great!
Banking at its finest!
One fine after noon i logged into my convenient online banking, to see a substantial amount of nsf fees.

If you are looking for a secure home-town bank feel, you will find it here with this credit union.
Every time i enter this bank i'm greeted with a smile and hello from the staff.
Keep up the great work first bank.
I was a bit skeptical about joining forces with a smaller bank.
After doing research i found out they were 5th in the country for banking and 3rd for mortgages.
Hey i felt more confidence, so i decided to go back and tranfer my accounts.
I went into the local branch and the banker was so pleasant.
A+ for customer service.
If you are looking for a great place with a great staff to bank with, don't hesitate.
The sign in sheet to see a personal banker looks like a clipboard that a customer forgot vs anything official.
I am still a fan, they have always been fair as they can be for being a huge bank.
I prefer the service at my community bank but they are too far and not enough locations.
He gave me the card of his mortgage banker caroline.
I've never been really impressed with this bank of america branch.

Alaska usa has everyone else beat when it comes to customer service and a financial convenience you can trust.
Why switch when your bank makes sure they have a presence to serve you to the area you have moved!?
I have never had a better banking experience.
Have enjoyed my banking experience.
From personal, to auto loans, savings and checking accounts.
I have to admit i do not bank with them.
One of my colleagues is a member of the bank and suggested we meet there.
I've been a customer for over 10 years and the customer service they provide is superb.
I went to the bank to get a document notarized and everyone was friendly and helpful.
I thought they were very professional and would recommend visiting the branch for your banking needs.
Overall i'm not a wells fargo fan and i'm really not a fan of grocery store bank branches in general.
My banking needs require that i visit a teller about once a week.
I expected them to scrutinize every $20 of the money i gave them, but that wasn't the case.
I really like the service they provide here.
So 500+ miles away from home into the desert, i pulled out my atm card at a non-us bank machine.
So then i pulled out my phone, logged into my account, and saw that i had a healthy balance.
The u.s. bank customer service line told me they shut my card down due to fraudulent charges.
They asked me about specific charges -- and these bank folks were right.
They quickly looked at my account, took my tainted atm card, and gave me a new temporary one.
I love this chase location so much i moved my ira from another brand of bank.
Really nice folks and service has always been over the top.
This branch is located in the smith's grocery store...it is a full-service bank, complete with an atm machine.
I've ordered foreign currency for a couple of trips, and done general banking with them since moving to fountain hills.
I doubt i've ever been in there longer than 15 minutes, except the time i opened the account.
I opened a checking/savings account and everything was explained in detail.
Josie ramirez and cindy burgos helped me with my new accounts today.
Been with clark county credit union over 12 years and wouldn't bank any where else.
I never knew that customer service could be this great at a credit union!
Makin a deposit, i mean it's a bank.
I'm involved with a few student orgs., so i frequent this bank pretty often.
I opened two different intelligent accounts and feel i have a much greater understanding of investments than before i called.
David's customer service was impeccable!!

I love this bank.
They go out of their way to make sure your account is secure.
The customer service was awesome and always has been.
This is a great bank and a very nice location.
I frequently visit chase bank for my home mortgage payments and rental property deposits.
If you live the area and use chase or are looking for a new bank...this is a good choice.
Love love love this bank
However, this means one less star today :[  like i said, not sure how it's supposedly fancier than a bank..
I will be moving my accounts somewhere else.
This is my go to bank i suppose because it is on my side of town.
It's a good thing i actually like this location and i'm not forced to travel far for banking.
At least i know my money is safe!
If there was an award for excellent service.
I recommend family trust to everyone, over all of their competitors especially the big bank fiasco.
Yesterday i set up my socialbees businesses account (finally!)
Now i'm ready for your credit cards, people... show me the money!
The bankers are very informative know all of the information we wanted to know.
I will be back to do my further banking.
So my husband and i have had an account with onenevada for almost 2 years now.
I've had my personal accounts with wells fargo for about seven years now.
I've been very happy with their locations, employees, and service.
Great service and liola little was amazing and very friendly!!
Is bofa the most dependable, efficient and trustworthy bank around?
But i'm happy with a majority of their features and online services that i'll keep using them...for now!
Really great loan rates and super quick turnaround time on closing the loan.
Way better than any of the big banks in town.
Very different from some of the big banks i've been with in the past.
Love sharonview it's the best bank on this planet.
Went in today to open a checking account and the banker was very nice and helpful!
Very easy to open the account.
I even closed early due to getting the loan funded early.
Service with a smile has always been the case, and i'm never just a customer.
If your money is in a bank, you're really missing out on the credit union membership experience.
These are things most people learn by the 5th grade, probably should take your banking advice from others.
Great people and services.
Branch manager assisted me in opening an account and proactively providing crucial information.
Services are great here and the interest rates are competitive.
I don't have an account here, however, i use their "shared branching" service.
Phenomenal customer service and very small business-friendly.
My experience with wells fargo bank dates back at least 25 years.
I chose the bank because it was close to my location at the time, and was a recognized banking establishment.
I opened a joint checking and savings account today with my family.
Frankie, the banker, was very thorough and informative.
I'm happy i did ... frankie gave us excellent customer service!
Nice and fast at this location, in n out 9 out of 10 visits.. all bank tellers are very pleasant.
Within 35 days six of the eight collections and a few late payments from other accounts were gone.
And better yet at the accounts are free!
I love this bank.
I have several accounts with them including a small business checking account which is totally free.
All of my accounts are free, one of them requires a minimum balance.
Clark county credit union and teri kight change lives one loan at a time...
Anjelica, my member services rep. was very friendly and personable and was quick to help me with my new account.
I can into this branch to do some banking and jackie helped me.
I would highly recommend this bank !
I love banking here!
Hcu is a nice bank and usually the people are too.
Love the place they have the best tellers and charlotte and loan agents.
I have been doing business with sharonview for 15 years now and the service is a+++++.
This branch is usually very good with good service, clear explanations, and solutions to problems.
I chose this bank originally because they were having a great deal to open up a checking account.
The only issue i had that keeps them from 5 stars for me is their loan department.
Other than that i have had no issues with this bank or its associates!
After dealing with such nice people; i decided to open an account with truwest credit union.
The representative that helped open the account was was wonderful also.
Thank you onenevada for going above and beyond in customer service.
It feels weird to review a bank .
.. but when you've had good service, it deserves a review.
I've been banking at this location for a few years, as i work less than a mile down the road.
I've been inside numerous times for notary services and cashier checks and always feel welcomed.
Some banks will make you feel like an inconvenience for services like that.
Her exceptional customer service and knowledge is appreciated.
I am very skeptical about this credit union but the saving grace was josie.
Not every location has telling to save money.
Also in the app, you can not view your account number.
I want to leave the big banks but not into the dumpster.
The people here are the most friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable bank staff i have ever met.
It is literally the customer service you would expect from a 5-star hotel.
We have our bank account, home loan, and daughter's account there.
I visited truwest credit union today to open a new checking and savings account.
The customer service is great and i highly recommend them to anyone looking for bank or credit union.
So many great folks work for this company and i wouldn't dream of banking with anyone else.
I don't have an account here.
I should open an account though...atm fees.
It's the george foreman of investing "set it and forget it", just don't forget to keep putting your money in!
You can deposit checks, transfer money, and see your investments and checking account all at a glance.
We've opened up new accounts here, done standard transactions, and had cashier's checks cut here.
Less people in the bank, and less people outside of the bank asking you for money when you leave.
Years ago, i banked here.
One more reason to hate the big banks.
She is phenomenal and the only person i trust for my business and personal banking.
I love this bank.
Nothing like grabbing lunch and doing your banking at the same time.
I am extremely happy with this bank.
They understand what i need and meet my expectations of service always.
This bank gives absolutely the worse rates for savings, checking, etc.
Its only good if you need a loan.
Dont give these people your money!
I appreciated being able to still access my money thru the atm.
I hate how banks would force you to withdraw from the atms in 20s.
I am no fan of banks but this particular branch is very efficient and customer oriented.
This is the second auto loan i've done with cccu.
In both instances i have received the best service.
This recent loan has been the quickest experience ever!!!
Opened up a new account at this branch.
Nice service, good bank (although some of the fees i dislike).
They are fast to take money out of my account, but slow to credit deposits and credits of any kind.
I'm thinking about switching banks, who is good?
Our loan closed on time and we are very happy with their service so far.
I've never had to wait long in line for a deposit or for a personal banker.
Came here mid afternoon for some simple banking.
Went in yesterday to set up an account and irene was fantastic.
This is not my bank but i had to stop in to do some business.
The manager stacy at truwest gave me excellent service and she is an excellent employee.
Left with a few accounts for a brief time and realized the mistake i made.
Great service along with great interest rates and account options.
I only have a checking and savings account with them.
My direct deposit and account withdrawals have been posted in a good amount of time.
If i could find a local bank which has that feature, i would switch over.
If you use the bill pay service, utilize the reminders.
And only if you get a checking/savings account and nothing else.
The customer service and staff at this bank are excellent!
And with redeeming old us savings bonds.
She is now closing her b of a accounts and transferring them to chase.
I am doing the same  - they truly still focus on customer service.
This is my go to bank because of the excellent service they provide.
Great staff here...very efficient and helpful, not to mention their people care about you and your banking needs.
I recommend anyone i know looking for a good bank to look into opening their account with compass.
I would think of banking anywhere else!
4 employees here, 2 tellers and 2 bankers.
Bankers have people at their desks, tellers are both not serving anyone.
Apparently tellers can't get customers into the safe deposit boxes, only bankers.
Thank you bank of america
We opened multiple accounts and car loan.
I do all my banking with them & find them to be very friendly and helpful.
Needed to start accounts for my two girls and deposit a check and spent about 30min in there.
Friendly people, good service.
Love this bank.. can always rely on great service,  great people and attitudes..
They explain everything help with all your needs.. all my kids have an account with trust worthy bank
This is the best place to do your banking!
In fact when my husband retires & we move from nevada we are keeping our account there!
I've been banking with them since 2006 and i don't have anything to complain about.
The tellers are nice and the service is exceptionally quick.
Personable and friendly is exactly how i like my bank.
I love this bank.
They have drive up banking and a atm.
I went into the branch for a car loan and left with savings and checking account.
At the time the checking accounts gave 5.25% apy on your checking account balance, far better than any savings account.
Over the past two years that rate has dropped to 2.25%, which is still higher than most every savings account.
Their customer service is great.
I highly recommend money usa.
This u.s. bank is great.
They have the best rates on loans & the best checking accounts.
They have free accounts for all military & students.
I recommend this bank.
I switched from associated bank to uwcu when i was 16 and will never look back.
I honestly can't imagine going to any other bank, even when i leave wisconsin!
I'm excited he's now my personal banker and financial guider.
If i ever need my bank account, i frequent this branch!!
For a bank this busy that's very much appreciated and acknowledged each and every time!
:)  i'm so happy to bank with them and have them cover my banking needs since i was 17!!
From start to finish, this was banking the way i always wished it could be.
Bankers don't care about being speedy or courteous, but this branch is a little better.
I needed to come up and open another account.
Our banker aaron was very courteous and knowledgeable re: the questions we had.
Not only was the service great but claudia was kind enough to even offer me a cold bottle of water.
The beauty of this bank machine is it's proximity to so many "cash only" joints.
A previous time, vanessa, another employee helped us set up our savings accounts and credit cards.
Favorite bank of america   thanks for going out the way, we really really appreciate it!!!!
Needed change and the atm does not provide that service.
The service people (not sure of their title) are outstanding as well.
I can't even remember the last time i visited my money at this branch.
I only opened this account because i got free banking since i had a mortgage with us bank.
The service here is great because the tellers know what they are doing.
It saddens me that i'll have to close my accounts soon since i'll be refinancing my loan.
Their associates sit at desks and call you when it is your turn to be serviced.
This location provides stellar customer service.
I actually prefer it because it forces me to be more conscience of my money.
All the money is in the atm.
This never happens normally at banks.
If you need a great bank they're here to assist.
Who would ever think that breaking up with a bank, especially bank of america (whom everyone knows i hate!!!!
Trying to close my accounts was like pulling teeth.
I received a letter with a form that needed to be notarized and sent back east to close the account.
Or i could go to any bank of america location for assistance.
Instead i was greeted by the sweetest customer service associate, called brianna.
So this branch really stands out as best as it possibly can for bank of america.
Her warmth and personality and caring nature make her better suited to a local bank.
I highly recommend this bank and branch to anyone and everyone interested in opening an account with a trustworthy bank!
That was the fastest i've ever been in this bank to pay my rent.
These customers i was auth today, are very familiar with banks and things we could do to make lives easier.
I'm puzzled by the low rating for this bank.
I needed to pick a bank/credit union and was pleased with chase's options.
It's really easy to keep track of where my money is going.
I always receive great service and decided to use them for all my banking/financial needs.
I come to this branch pretty often to make deposits and get my banking business squared away.
Highly recommend the loan officer noah kovner.
You won't want to get your loan from anywhere else once you've spoken with them.
After comparing rates, closing costs, customer service, points, lenders... we realized how little we knew about mortgages.
While i am still not a fan of taking money of customer's sight, i think the remedial effort was applaudable.
Never in my life has any bank issues been so easy.
I will continue using this particular bank just because of their services!!
I would recommend suzie to anyone that wants a "great" bank representative.
I wanted to refi my auto loan and the staff at oncu took great care of me.
I look forward to banking with one nevada credit union.
And this place has been my go-to bank because it's close to my house.
Every time i step my foot on this bank, i'm always greeted with a smile!
There are more parking spaces at the back space of the bank.
I would recommend this team to anyone looking for employment or a mortgage loan.
I use this bank almost every other day.
I couldn't ask for kinder bankers.
Thank you for the continuous outstanding customer service.
Ryan takes such good care of my account!!
This has happened countless times and the phone automation thing sometimes will take forever to unfreeze your account.
Excellent, freindly service with a smile.
This is the place where you want to conduct all your banking buisness.
I've visited this branch on two separate occasions to set up new accounts.
From what i know they have a couple basic ways you can have your account set up.
I have used the electronic account and it has served me well.
Then you would only pay a fee when you use your debit card or use electronic services like the atm.
They were nice and understanding and got me out of a bad loan.
My whole family banks here and that family tradition will keep on going.
I come to this bank almost everyday to make the deposit for my work.
I hold my bank to a higher standard as it is handling my money for me.
Yet another reason as to why banking with cccu is the best.
Thanks again claudia for your exceptional customer service!
I had no idea wells fargo offered free notary services.
I've had some banking issues in the past which frustrated me but it was never the tellers fault.
The combination of my chase app, atm deposit capability and their service is a reason i choose chase.
Quick and easy if you do not want to deal with bank tellers for deposits and withdrawals.
Great service and i love to support my local community
I've been a cccu member since april 2014, i now have a auto loan, checking, savings & unsecured credit card.
I have nothing but good things to say about this bank.
They have approved me for my auto refi where some banks have denied me!
I do most of my banking that way.
Went to the bank this afternoon since needed questions answered about my account that could not answer.
Got a fraud alert on my account and it wanted to make sure that i am an american citizen.
Other branches we have visited have also been outstanding with service.
We have referred many friends, family members and clients and they all love this bank, especially this branch!
He signed us up to meet a banker who could assist us and open a new account.
It had only been 15 minutes when our banker, mr. david van vorce took us to his office.
He also showed us boa's new mobile app services, and admittedly, i learned as well.
He was able to safe me thousands, not hundreds, on my home loan.
That's a winning combination, save money and get the best professional assistance from a savvy pro!
Very easy experience, no hassle, great customer service,  and there agent charlene was very helpful!
On a happy day for me at work, i went to the bank.
Does visa really charge that much to use their services?
The bank has since followed up wiht me after this review in an effort to make things right.
Location has regular "bank hours" for walk-in/in-person transactions.
The first time i got the impression he had never opened an account before.
Then i sat and waited another 10min for him to figure out how to open my checking account.
I've been here for 35 min and my account is still not open.
My other bank is chase, and they are always fast.
Higher interest rates than traditional banks,  great source for mutual funds & investments; as well as mortgages; even commercial.
Often, he proposes ideas to save me money and secure my future further (who doesn't want that!).
She then asks me to verify the date i opened my account with one nevada.
I have had my account for years!!
I'm not calling to ask for money or personal information, i'm trying to prevent someone from using my card fraudulently.
I've been with ssscu for about 3 years and i needed a loan.
Jane dela cruz assisted me with my loan and credit card process very smoothly and efficiently.
We did the loan transaction over the phone and signed off on email and i thought that was very easy.
She's very helpful in getting me my loan and credit card.
I would highly recommend jane dela cruz for any loan transaction or credit card approval.
It is easy to brag about steve jarosh at midfirst bank.
He is the vice president/east valley business banking manager.
I haven't had good experiences with the bank of america telephone helpline.
However, today i was so pleased with amazing customer service.
I explained my issue to brian the bank teller.
I am a very satisfied customer and i am thankful to have my finances at bank of america.
Teresa popp was amazing in helping me with my auto loan 1.99%.
Plus a 0.25% promo, my loan will be 1.74%.
Very easy and painless auto loan ever!!!!
Just first rate service always.
I opened an auto loan yesterday and leesa lopez assisted me in doing so.
We charged the full cost of the condo on our costco citibank credit card.
First time i opened a credit union account and i had a very positive experience.
I tested my bankers patience this past week.
While i was signing my loan he had many people waiting for him in the lobby.
I have always had great service and been very happy with all of my insurance needs.
My husband and i recently had the pleasure of working with skyler spicer on a loan.
He still saved me some money and added gap insurance.
Now i have my bank accounts with them and a personal loan.
Decent customer service in the lobby.
Wonderful staff, excellent customer service.
I have used title loan companies in the past and not with the greatest experience.
I hope to move all my banking there as soon as possible.
After more than 50 years dealing with banks, this was a stellar experience.
The customer service and financial planning services are phenomenal.
They don't have much in the way of online banking yet (bill pay).
I much prefer dealing with these guys over the big corporate banks.
A nice community bank that has all the bells and whistles of the major banks without the sterile, major-bank feel.
A great bank i'd recommend to anyone.
If you're looking for a new bank and you live on the west side, you really should check them out.
Upon my second visit, i was directed to the manager of customer service.
One of the best service i've had with personal banker, pranay naidu.
Kyndra made it a quick and easy process to open a checking account.
Fast, friendly and all around great service.
All other banks request switching but none can compare to bofa online.. and they know it.
Overall, i like banking with them.
I desperately wish they would update the atm's to post cash deposits immediately to your account.
From nj and i needed to find a bank that was local.
I researched many banks (and their programs) and couldn't decide between wells fargo and bank of america.
After reading reviews (and seeing which  services were best) i decided to go with boa and i'm glad i did.
I definitely recommend this location to set up any accounts.
My bank advisor was vondrelle.
Credit one bank will not give credit to anybody with average or above average credit.
Credit one bank only deals with risky people.
Thank you adrian esparza, he is a personal banker in this branch.
This is my regular neighbourhood td bank - pros:  easily accessible, decent hours cons:  that there are security guards often.
The lines are sometimes long, but that's how it is at a bank.
Friendly and goes the extra mile.. my favorite bank and my favorite location
I value great service wherever i go and this office gives just that, genuine great service.
One nevada credit union green valley branch financed the loan.
I was amazed that the speed my loan processed.
The service at this branch was outstanding.
I am very satisfied with this bank.
Didn't interact with of the employees however i'm really enjoying having an account with sun trust.
This is one of my favorite banks in the las vegas area.
It all started when i had fraud on my account.
Apparently some thief stole my checks and decided to go on a shopping spree and use my checking account.
I've been a customer of uwcu for almost a year and have been very satisfied with the service.
Another bank would not verify a check i had written on my account with the other bank.
I was never a fan of chase bank when they bought out washington mutual.
I was a long time customer at washington mutual and loved the service i always got with them.
The thought of going to a large bank had me leary.
When i moved to las vegas and opened my business i went to set up a business account.
Just the type of service i love.
I came in to the bank for a quick withdrawal.
This is by far the best wf branch i've banked with.
This week, i received excellent customer service from mr. hernandez.
My mom and i went in today for some help to change some account numbers due to a fraud situation.
Great service, at a great bank!
Any day, or any time i have performed business here, i've always experienced prompt exceptional courteous service.
This is the best bank by far, of any others in the valley!
I had two accounts in mi, one citizen bank and the other chase.
So i immediately went online to transfer the funds from citizen bank to my chase account.
Their personal and professional approach will make me a lifetime, loyal chase bank customer.
Thank you mandy and shawn and thank you chase bank!
He had great customer service.
Dennae opened up a savings and checking account for me; she made the process incredibly easy and pleasant!
Very easy group to deal with and made my loan and subsequent home buying process extremely efficient.
I couldn't be more pleased with the customer service i have received at this particular branch.
I would highly recommend banking here !
I banking with chase and it's the best bank in the us.
Fast service and very pleasant experience.
My husband and i have accounts here- he used to work for b of a, for 14 years.
Eva was really nice- she was personal banker, but we haven't seen her lately.
This is my bank that i use practically every week.
The customer service at this branch is top notch!
I struggled with banks for the longest time because desert schools did not have a business section.
It's charges for that, it's charges for this-that seems to be the way of the big business banking machine.
I would say hands down the best banking experience i've ever had.
I was completely in shock but also wowed by that personalized customer service.
This is a direct reflection on the person in charge of the bank.
I switched to this bank after having a number of bad experiences with ohio savings bank.
My experiences with this bank were largely good.
I would definitely use their services again in the future and recommend them to any first time buyers.
If you need a home loan i'm not aware of a better option.
A competitor said they are never able to close within 30 days but they did on my loan.
Otherwise, great "bank" inside of frys.
They always have the best rates and the best customer service.
Had to stop in a visit this location for some banking services.
I am extremely impressed with the level of customer service provided.
They always have the best customer service and the lines or drive through move quickly.
The branch manager and mortgage banker are so super helpful!
I have had two auto and one signature loan with no problems.
We also have used their free notary service many times.
Smaller crédit union, but offers good rates on vehicles avid decent interest in savings.
If you are part of the banner health system i would recommend you open an account.
You'll appreciate their customer service and as an account holder, you become part owner in their operations.
She explained the terms of the loan clearly.
I found the terms to be fair, even lenient considering the horror stories i've heard about regarding car title loans.
Last week i visited this bank to deposit cash in their outside atm.
After inserting nearly $500, the atm took the money, said transaction completed but failed to give me a receipt.
I immediately checked my account and the money had not deposited.
I went inside and spoke with an attendant you confirmed the money did not post.
Giving this bank a 5 star not because of their atm, but their exceptional team.
I enjoy banking with wells fargo.
The bank is always clean and the people at this location always greet me with a smile.
As long as i have money in the bank.
I've had a riverset/pittsburgh teacher's credit savings account since i was a child.
I like the personal feel that a credit union offers over a bigger banking institution.
Sed and his staff always put customer service first.
The manager, tellers, and personal bankers here have been extremely helpful in getting my accounts in order!
I do my banking at this branch whenever possible!
Always have good luck with usbank always nice and professional!
I've had account for many years never a problem.
Just opened a new account today.
Come in here and ask for robert if you're trying to open a new business account.
They offer free night drop services, which i highly recommend if you have employees dealing with cash.
Would highly recommend and i experienced great service today!
Overall, the customer service was great and if i had to work with anyone it would have to be her.
Work with the banks located on green valley and stephanie.
Originated the account at stephanie and have had nothing but good experiences with the manager cheryl.
I have always been happy with my service.
The customer service is good.
I ended up going to another bank to get a secured credit card.
I was disappointed but my own bank did not have this option for me.
Fortunately that secured credit card option at the other bank worked out and i built my credit.
There is no need to shop further for a title loan- this is the place, ask for claudia.
Good service  i've been a member of the credit union for nearly a year now.
I have a checking, savings, and ira account so i go to the credit union fairly often.
It took a short time to set up my account.
Overall, i would recommend this credit union, over big banks.
I was able to get it all done super fast and easy thanks to super austin at us bank.
Thanks for the friendly, great service guys!
Pat estfan and his staff with state farm have provided us with exceptional service and a superior product.
I am giving onenv (1) more shot and will keep my accounts open.
This is just one example of the ways in which this bank stands out above the rest.
The atm branch is not as extensive as many banks, however.
This bank is excellent to use if you live or work near one of its branches.
Quick efficient service with minimal wait time!
If anyone is looking for a new place to bank with great customer service, please check out us bank
Best bank in the land!!!
I've tried the other major banks and got nothing but fees fees and extra fees.
From auto refi to small loans..you get the best rates.
I had a new account and my check deposited before i had to be back at work!
People who struggle financially always get taken advantage of when there is a loan or credit involved.
This bank is inside fry's.
This is my go-to spot when i need documents notarized (a free service for u.s. bank account holders).
The employees at this u.s. bank are always very cordial and helpful.
I love this bank.
The customer service is great.
I have been coming to this bank for years and i have never had a bad experience here.
The lines (if present) move quickly so the thought of going to the bank is not a dreadful one.
I am positive i will stay with this bank for years to come.
Noteworthy that they have staff available for both regular banking appointments you'd find at stand-alone locations, not just tellers.
But esther wasn't pushy about me doing that; she just seemed interested in helping me save money.
Sitting down to open new accounts was painless and simple.
I have had excellent service since day 1.
He even matched my interest rate on the loan i had just payed off!!
This is the service of concerned compassionate people helping others.
I adore chase bank.
However, 3 months ago i decided to move my banking business from one of the local mega banks in pittsburgh.
I had always been a large bank customer primarily because mega banks have branches and atms all over the city.
Finally after years of lousy service and increasing fees i switched my accounts to first national.
I know it is hard to get excited about a bank...but wow!
That's enough about boring banks i will now go back to my more exciting restaurant reviews.
I'll stick to the location in gilbert for any banking needs.
Overall, wells fargo is a solid bank.
This review is meant to illustrate this specific bank location's accountability, which i found to be excellent.
She immediately reversed the fee because the banker had given me his word.
This is great news, and i'm happier to be with this bank because this branch honored their word.
Their customer service was great!
Love the "small bank" feel!
Been banking with them for about 14 years and despite the bank's expansion, it's still easy to deal with!
Great customer service, both over the phone and in person.
Wish there was an office in ca as i'd do all of my banking there!
My husband and i recently opened an account at one nevada credit union.
Our new personal banker is marco wilbowo.
He made us feel welcome and comfortable with our decision to keep our money at one nevada credit union.
I love that we got out debit card minutes after we opened the account.
I guess this is your typical wells fargo bank.
They do have notary services available at this location, which is very convenient.
Desire is a great agent, extremely helpful and provided excellent service.
All banks about the same, it's the interior business sector and the willingness to help you.
I can not say enough about the level of customer service candise provided.
Cashier and banker were both awesome, friendly and helpful.
Feels great to receive excellent customer service, and these ladies didn't disappoint :)
I went to bank of america across the street first and was treated like garbage.
Whom i used to be a long time customer of for many years but left due to poor customer service.
What other bank or cu gives you a 5% rebate on your loans?
I enjoy banking with chase bank as this is my home bank.
Overall service was good.
They have added drive up banking and a atm to the outside.
The bank is clean inside and the tellers have always been friendly towards me.
Great customer service at this branch!
Very informative about all or questions and awesome customer service!!!
Absolutely amazing experience with fernanda at the banking department.
Thank you so much for making switching over to your bank an easy and seamless transition fernanda.
Located just south of glendale ave and the i-17, it offers lobby and drive-thru services.
I would definitely recommend his services to anyone looking for a home loan.
Started using this us bank on w. lake mead about two months ago and have enjoyed superior service since.
Always go into bank, staff is always friendly and attentive.
Keep it up, us bank, i'm counting on this level of service on a regular basis!
Help me establish new accounts for bill pay, help me save money for the future!!!
Kevin thornton provided excellent service today during my visit to u.s. bank.
Thank you bright for taking care of my loan and making my families dream home a reality
Is not your usual bank behind big thick glass.
You actually sit at a desk with the banker.
I have had basic accounts, car loans, and other loans and have gotten the best interest rates around.
Service is great too.
I've had an account with this credit union since i was born.
I went to the bank to create a notarized document to fax to another bank regarding the disbursement of funds.
It was the best customer service experience i've had in long time.
Walnut creek branch tellers and bankers are such a great bunch.
They make you feel like you could stay in the bank all day.
She was very friendly very outgoing very professional and i'm very pleased with her service.
Prompt customer service from my girl crystal!
Very pleased with my service experience.
I came to this branch since it's closest to my family's house; expecting to get okay customer service.
Your customer service skill is beyond what anyone can expect.
Nicole is very pleasant and her customer service is appreciated.
Big bank but very little personal touch.
But the best part was the amount of money they saved me by bundeling my policies.
My overall savings were over 300 dollars per month.
The bankers here are very nice and friendly.
The best part is that one of the bankers remembers my name.
I love this bank i've been banking here since 2006.
They have excellent customer service and they are very helpful when it comes to your needs.
Very awesome friendly service at this wells fargo.
The staff here smile and provide customer service like it should be.
Why do you have that much in a checking account anyways?
Ok this bank is full of nice people who share the secrets of saving & investments.
They are sweet people but i love this bank 4th.
Three other banks come before it in my book.
It's true everyone can't have first place but i think this bank don't try to come in first.
Customer service could be over all better.
I opened an account here about six months ago and i could not be happier with my experience so far.
I've had great experiences at this branch with multiple associates - managers, tellers, and personal bankers.
This bank is two minutes from my house so i'm always there for any of my banking needs.
I've bank with cccu for a shorter amount of time compared to my other banks i bank with.
I've been assisted by jody before and i've received her dry customer service before.
I opened a small business account with tamala soboyejo at this location.
She explained all my account details and completely walked me through the process of the account.
If you need a new account or just a smile and a good laugh then tamala is your person.
Excellent customer service by sandie sanchez.
This bank is family owned and it shows in the quality of service.
I do online banking and direct deposit.
I opened my account while they were having a promotion and the incentive money was promptly paid as promised.
I thought "well i guess the honeymoon's over" and expected a decline in service.
I still continue to receive first class service.
The bank locations are very clean with higher end interior design.
This is banking like it should be.
Other businesses could use this bank as a perfect business model.
Oh yes.......very very few fees (other bank atms and those are refunded at the end of the month!
It's a chase bank branch in scottsdale.
Their staff is caring and very helpful , great customer service .
She was able drop my payment on my vw saving $102.00 a month as well as dropping my interest rate!!!
Her service was prompt and so helpful!
Bank of america occupies much of downtown charlotte and they have done an amazing job of making the area great.
I would recommend to make an appointment ahead of time if you need one of those services.
Everyone has been very helpful over the last 3 years i've banked with them.
5 star service thank you
I visited one nevada credit union last week and was extremely impressed with the customer service i recieved.
The products/services that this credit union offers fits my financial needs.
Service at this location was fast and flawless.
I rarely go into banks since i prefer to deal with direct deposit and electronic transfer.
I switched from us.bank
The great customer service is very much appreciated.
Have used wells fargo and desert schools for smaller loans in the past and prefer desert schools.
They're local, they're service very friendly and we have been impressed with their attention to detail and to us.
We appreciate their services and will continue to borrow from them in the future.
They do notarization services for free too which is very convenient.
Did my banking and was on my way.
"hello welcome into u.s. bank" all in sync i was like oh wow lol.
One of the banker/tellers that assisted me had great energy and very friendly.
Any who until then thanks for the great service!
Erika mchenry at this location is super nice, awesome, and provides amazing customer service towards her clients.
It's not surprising (and mostly likely not the banks fault) you're having trouble with this card too.
Started with a $500 limit, crappy credit and now i'm at $2k and several other regular bank cards.
I only keep it open because it would severely drop the age of my accounts if i closed it.
I'm sure half their accounts are in some collection status.
If you're really paying with a debit card, just use your bank info and enroll in online payments (free).
All of my family happily banks at this branch.
I have been banking with big commercial banking institutions for most of my life, but never again!
I have had a great experience with marco wibowo and onenevada since opening my account.
I've banked with wells for well over 10 years including checking, savings and a home mortgage.
I have never been unhappy with the service i've received at wells.
By having the mortgage with them and keeping a reasonable minimum balance i get all my banking for free.
Wells has great online banking options and a very good mobile app.
I am absolutely pleased with the service i received at one nevada credit union.
It was easily the best service i have ever recieved from a financial establishment.
Auto loan  rate is 2.79% and no payment for 90 days not even a dealership can give you this deal!
If your sitting down with a banker, kimberly is good.
I've done most of my banking throughout my life with two institutions.
She helped me solve my problems and answered all questions regarding my account.
Ing direct is my favourite bank.
I can say this with confidence because i have tried three different banks.
The service is great.
I always get greeting right the way when i step in or out of the bank.
Helpful, caring service, with smiles.
I have banked here for years,  and i will be a life long customer.
Everything about this bank is a+.
They even have locations in supermarkets to make banking more convenient.
I prefer to bank in the us bank building where their top pros are ready for anything i need.
Other banks should study this bank's business model to see how it should be done.
When i walk in this bank, i feel happy knowing my money is in good hands.
I have never seen such a well run banking company in my life.
Use us bank and you will be a very happy customer!
My favorite bank hands down!
I went into this location to handle some business and the service was quick and exceedingly exceptional.
They are very informative knowledgeable about their services.
Thank you for the consistent customer service!
I have been a member for several years and i am extremely pleased with the customer service at this location.
To avoid this, i usually just park in the large parking lot that the bank is part of.
The banking hours are typical and they are open longer on fridays to accommodate pay days.
The bankers and tellers are always friendly and greet you with a smile.
I've had a savings account here for a while.
I didn't have such a great experience in the past but went in to open a checking account.
When i make a deposit or withdraw, the bank tellers are always very quick and professional.
Good place to bank at, sadly there's only 1 teller doing both the front counter and the drive-thru.
Happy they don't close until 6pm compare to bank of america that only open until 5pm.
I was extremely satisfied, even amazed by the service.
I want to thank alejandro for truly a professional service.
Crystal is excellent and her customer service is one of kind superb.
As i mentioned, their service when it comes to loans is outstanding.
It's a good place to have a savings account should you need loan services.
But it can be a bit challenging to have a checking account with them.
The differences between uwcu and major banks in the atmosphere, value, and services is incredible.
Such a nice change from the usual customer service phone experiences.
Sandie sanchez introduced herself to me and she took the time to explain to me the different account options.
Imagine that...calling a bank and speaking to a live person.
So i set up an appointment with sandie and she set me up with my accounts.
I highly recommended anyone interested in opening an account or has an existing account, to go see him!
I recently just got a new car loan and leesa was amazing with the process.

Shout out to dennae and all the staff for always having service with a smile!
Not only did we move all of our banking, but ended up refinancing our cars here as well.
If true, i am no longer using your bank.
Greed is the only reason to cut out jobs and give no customer service that counts.
Are you going 100% online banking?
The service is wonderful, but try to avoid coming in the late afternoon: the line gets crazy.
Ever lose your bank card?
Go sit in the blue seats and wait to see a banker, not line up to the teller.
Hands down first rate in service and can't beat the cost.
My parents opened the account for me and put $50 in to start me out.
And first car loan.

Take that big banks!

I have a safety deposit box here and never have a problem with the service at this location.
He's the branch manager and he assist me with opening up an account.

We attempted to get a loan from bofa in 2012 for our first home - a new construction condo.

Today i came in with my boyfriend to start off his account with desert schools and to deposit a check.
The bank has access to an atm, lines inside the branch are never long.

The interior of the building means nothing to me if the customer service is outstanding!
I have been dreading opening an account for quite some time.
Anyways i have no issue with bank of america nor the service at this location!
Cibc must be paying quite a bit to toronto pearson airport authority to be the exclusive banking service inside yyz.
If you are a cibc customer, you can do a debit from your account towards the foreign cash you purchasing.

I had a issue with a loan officer there and bill bright went over and beyond to make things right.
Ryan reached out to me today too wanting to let me know more about the company services.

He was super helpful, accommodating and had great customer service skills.
I used to be a customer with bank of america.

Very refreshing to be treated like a human (: great customer service and no bullet proof glass.
Feels like a financial institution rather than 24 hr checks cashed and payday loan/boa(:!!
Note: all branches offer coin counting for all customers and it is free for cmcu account holders.
This location primarily handles business accounts.
Not much else to say but over the past ten years i have banked with wells i have zero complaints.
This is the main us bank location for phoenix.
I'm going to continue to bank there, they do a great job.
Yes, i did think they were a capitol one account at first (and i have two of them).
I have never had my account threatened or received threatening phone calls.
Oh how i love my sweet little bank.
The drive up atm and teller windows are perfect for banking on the go.
Dont waste your money on the $20 a month fee and go somewhere else.
As long as there are some people in this bank that actually care about their customers ill be staying.
Nice, professional bank right off scottsdale and thunderbird.
Thanks for the service :-)

I have always had great service here.
Don't get me wrong, i am not a real fan of banks in general.
However, when it comes to customer service this branch is usually on.
That day i took the loan never rushed and even given alternative places to seek a loan by miss  claudia.
So go get a loan and mention my name .
Had great service here, bank associate was very friendly and most are bilingual here.
My favorite bank hands down.
I have a personal banker!
I am not a millionaire by any means, but midfirst bank makes me feel like one.
She came to my office to introduce herself and drop off some banking information.

He emmulates excellent customer service and truly cares about your banking needs from a-z.
I knew i had the right creditmunion and personal banker.

I am excited to have to have such an amazing personal banker and credit union.
No longer ing direct - as of april 2014 tangerine is still a great place to bank.
Not exactly as punitive as the other big banks, but still not the same warm fuzzy it used to be.
I expect other changes, but still better than the big banks by leaps and bounds.
Right now, if you refer a friend, and a friend opens an account with $$, both of you get $50?!
No fee chequing with the thrive account, gic's and other investment options exist as well.
Atm banking you now have access to all the scotiabank atm's including the ones in 7-11 stores.
I do 99.9% of my banking online, occasionally i have to call, and they have really excellent customer service.
Welcoming and sincere customer service is truly refreshing.
Chase bank has a very unsafe feature at their atm.
Your bank card sits outside the atm for any one to snatch.
The service from suzie drinkwine was excellent.
I would definitely recommend this company and branch for banking!
Rahul always takes exceptional care of our needs and provides amazing customer service.
They have online banking and are more than willing to assist with anything you need at anytime!

After that he did his magic and closed out my account.
I just had to take the slip he handed me to the teller to get the money.
My other bank is usaa.
Coolest thing, the drive thru atm gives out $50 bills when you take out a larger sum of money!

Arrived at nooner to get a bank draft, line up was juicy but went quickly.
Bank is nice, bright, very close to train station just off 7th avenue.
I initially went to the decatur/215 location to set up a trust account.
We have been banking with a different credit union for over 20 years and were apprehensive with changing our banking.
However we received great service from the minute we entered cccu.
We are less apprehensive of the transition to cccu due to the great service we received.
Ing direct is cool in the way no banks are cool, because generally banks aren't very cool.
It's a unique place: like ing's banking philosophy, it's not your traditional branch.
The service is always prompt and the tellers are well-trained.
No complaints here but minus one star because no extraordinary friendly service
Great bank coming back for sure.
I am so thankful not to use a big commercial bank.
Really excellent customer service!
Definitely gonna be my go to place whenever i need to handle anything with my chase account.

She asked me to call her if it wasn't fixed by this morning, well, checking this morning, yay!
The branch is fine  - the national service sucks.
I wanted to write a well justified review for your amazing loan officer sandie sanchez.
This will always be my only bank, i go out of my way for this particular branch.
Service is always swift and friendly.
Hands down best loan place in las vegas.
If you want good and fast service on a loan and so happen to be around the area.
One nevada gives me exactly what i want from a financial institution...efficient, reliable, and cheerful service.
Their customer service is fantastic.
I honestly recommend this bank 100%!!
So most of my banking is done on-line.
I'm using their simple checking account, simple savings account, and payback plus credit card (2% cash back on all purchases!).
You also earn a bit of interest in the checking account, which is nice.
One other slight annoyance is that their online banking does not connect to mint for account aggregation.
Overall, aside from the clunkiness of the online banking, i really have no complaints about riverset.
Becca akana helped me navigate services and open accounts, set up services needed/wanted.
No fees, great rates for car loans, and this particular location has the best staff.
Their customer service stands out.
I didn't know i could get that money back.
They have also expressed how happy they were with brandon's service skills and personal attention.
I have been using uwcu for more than 5 years for checking, savings, and credit card and i love it.
I switched over to uwcu from associated bank and i'm very happy with it.

I can't say enough about how good the service i received was across the board.
I would recommend claudia to anyone looking to take out a loan.
Went in to open an account today and i am completely pleased with the service.
I left the 2 banks i had business and personal accounts with and opened 5 accts.
The online banking is easy to use.
There isn't a whole lot of details about the customer service here because it sits right in the middle.
They are a full service bank with a great attitude...just ask lucy!

Although nicole moved to the main branch we do still use stephanie street and still receive excellent service there.
I have banked with wells fargo for years, and have had a very positive experience, in general.

Spoke to bank manager gustavo m. very helpful helped me get a mortgage.
Btw got a bank draft for 5k in under five minutes and they knew me by name.
Lets you know what is happening with the loan process every step of the way.
I don't know any other such a big banks with such a short hours...  wells fargo - way to go.
Seems legit to put my foot down when unnecessary service is being forced down my throat.
We all work hard for the money and i plan to stay in control of what i do with it.
Great service and the friendly tellers is just a plus.
Also to have a personal banker is quite nice.
I love my bank.
I love my bank.
If you're related to a member of the bank, you can be a member.
I walked into the first u.s. bank that i've ever walked into today.
I was there to open an account and i'm glad i did.
My account has a lot of up-to-date features that i didn't know existed.
I previously banked with one nevada credit union and i did so for many years.
But at least at first glance, u.s. bank has been a good choice for my future banking needs.
Another thing that i like in particular about this bank is that the teller and customer transaction happens sitting down.
Services my credit union from california, very easy to work with.
I can always call the customer service number for prompt assistance.
Service seems to be simple and uncomplicated.
Online banking is greatly improved from two years ago so i am a pretty happy member.
I've dealt with many mortgage brokers and loan officers and none can compare to or deliver like bill's team!
Not many of us have to go into banks much anymore.
We were bringing someone there to open a new account, and we waited about 30 minutes to be seen.
Never an issue with service at this branch

Great customer service, attractive decor and location makes this td branch stand out among the city's best branches.
This was my first interaction with customer service.
Sharwani has been an amazing source of relief of expected banking issues and keeping the cccu standard alive.
My preferred bank :) clean and easy.
When it comes to the banking industry, i'm usually pretty disgusted with the whole lot.
Despite being the sort of person who doggedly stayed with local banks (remember those?)
Despite friends' warnings (isn't there a war story about every bank?
A bank that puts the spirit of law before the letter of it?
Isn't good service so often the dealbreaker when it comes to choosing or staying with a bank?
The last few times i've entered the bank yolanda has been such a huge help.
Her friendliness and upbeat personality lightens the mood from a usual bank experience.
Will never go to a "bank" again.
We recently opened a new checking/savings account after moving from oregon to henderson.
No problems with this bank.
One of the most friendly banks, staff rocks, debbie, dawn are great personnel unlikely other banks.
I have banked with chase bank my entire adult life.
The chase corporation should be extremely proud of this branch, as the customer service is top notch.
It is a pleasure to do my banking there.
I'm a long-time user of bofa....so i'm not reviewing the bank chain - just this location itself.

Parama is the best kept secret in banking in toronto!!
I live in vancouver now, though, and that hasn't really stopped me from enjoying their services.
But you would get the money back if you wanted to leave.
I recently switched from bank of america.
I didn't know banking could be this easy and no fees!
He made me feel very comfortable and even showed me how make 2% on my checking account.
The way you always imagined your bank should treat you.

So polite, friendly, and courteous- i think she may be my favorite teller ever, at any bank!
The bank/credit union was clean and there was no wait when i arrived.
Customer service was also excellent.
Would recommend this place great customer service !
Note: this review pertains to the facilities at the pines in urbana and the main bank on university ave.
I am astonished at all the negative reviews for busey bank.
All my banking is done there.
I have been steered right in all my business -- refinancing, ira, loans, whatever.
Online banking intimidated me but busey's online banking has been easy to use.
Good fast friendly service, nice employees
Most recently, i had to cash in quite a few savings bonds.
I totally get the hype of switching from a big bank to a credit union!
This is a bank, what could i write about it?
I frequently do my banking here.
The customer service here is fine.
Usually it is my typical banking and i progress to the cue leading to the tellers.
And right in the bank that problem was taken care of.
And, customer service is another reason that i often bank here.
I like this banking center!
Came up here to set up a new account.
Clean good coffee and friendly service i'll be back.
A great bank and home lender to work with.

Please continue to offer this level of service because it will keep customers banking with this bank.

Now i have kids accounts and a loan through them.
I recently discovered that you can walk into a place called a bank and walk out with something called "cash".
It is a small branch that offers tellers and personal banking experience.
I was immediately greeted and serviced with a smile.
This was my first checking account, i was 16 and just got my first job!
They were a great bank, always helpful and friendly.
But i definitely recommend them for opening up your first account.
I also didn't like that there were few and far between locations compared to larger banks.
They have always been there when i needed a car loan, signature loan or if i just had questions.
I came to the tangerine cafe to open a new bank account.
It is a busy branch but then all bank of america offices in the supermarkets are extremely busy!
I've noticed lately that service has improved and attribute it to great teamwork the team is now displaying.
They were, as mentioned, happy to help me move my account over to america first credit union.
This is a great main branch bank!

I have been banking with them for 4 years and have never had even one issue.
I also feel as if they don't pressure you to open other services.
If anyone talks about bank issues, i always find myself raving about my wonderful banking experiences!!!
From the employees, to the service and fraud department, they've always been top notch.
Superb people and service!

I was shopping for auto loans and wanted a specific rate.
My own chase bank couldn't even get close with a pretty good credit score and income.

We have also referred a few friends to chuck's office and they could not be more happy with his service.

This branch provides excellent service in a friendly, relaxed atmosphere.
Quite a different banking experience than the impersonal mega-banks where employees change and managers get relocated frequently.
Chad bernal was phenominal in helping me set up a new account today.
I recommend this branch and chads services to anyone looking for a quality hometown feeling.
I enjoyed doing my banking over here.

There were transients right near the front entrance begging everyone for money.
Would like to see that service offered at this location.
I normally like chase compared to other banks, but i don't really understand what they are doing to this location.
Felt like i was at bank of america???
Excellent service and employees that care.
Banker alen g. showed genuine concern and took the time out of his day to assist with my banking needs.
This was actually one of the first banks of america i ever visited.
Back then, i think it was nationsbank.
I've been banking with wf for 21 years and this is by far the best location i've been to.
That's what makes a great business model; no matter what the product or service is that they are selling.
I'd previously banked at a 1st bank in colorado.
The service was outstanding.
I've now been to two separate branch locations of first bank in the phoenix area.
Both of them have the same outstanding customer "friendly" service.
Whomever is in charge of the corporate customer service policy, thank you!
The friendly service at first bank blows every other bank out of the water.
They are a giant bank however, and the staff doesn't have any leeway for bending the rules.
Specifically with two incredible bankers wanda and seema!
We spoke on the way to the bank and bang!
I can't say enough about this amazing service i just experienced!
You give them your hard earned money.
There is really no need to beat a dead horse, a bank is a bank is a bank.
I would highly recommend mountain america and jared to anyone looking for a great place to bank with!

The world works until five and you supply the money.
I go here regularly as the hours are great, and the customer service is top notch.
In fact, you can park halfway between the harkins and the us bank and save gas.
If you have been to some other banks with grumpy tellers this place will be refreshing.

Im waiting to open a new bank account.
Location is the the key on a great bank.
Amazing bank for small business.
Seth is an outstanding bank representative of the bank.
We ultimately decided to give into the monster and settled on bank of america.
Setting up the business account wasn't hard.
Neither were the personal accounts, really.
How about an extra account for your dog?
Then the real difficulty began: transferring money.
Finally, it seems that they didn't order the debit cards for the accounts like they said they would.
I recently opened up a bank account for our school ptsa with this branch.
The personal banker's name was sabrina petit.
They offered our ptsa no fee checking, which included free checks!
If you've ever tried to open a business account anywhere else, you'd know that this is a big deal.
The bank was out of money bags the day that i set up the account.
So great in fact that we are thinking about going to open savings accounts for our kids there with her!

Online banking at ds is still in last century with glitches that he helped explain.
Great customer service hands down and always professional!
We opened our business accounts here.
We have always received extremely helpful service.
It's a full service location with the fancy atms inside which disperse $1, $5 & $20 bills.
Friendly tellers and a terrific biz banker.
I guess i'm used to all banks dealing with my account in a "we want to keep him away".
My local bank with my local account gets very little business out of me.
I have other banks that treat me very well, and they have most of my money.
Thank you jab for fantastic customer service!
Knowledgeable service and gets you in and out quickly!
Walked in this morning to find one of my old banker, managing.
What a great asset mike h.,  is to bank of america.
This is a really modern bank.
This place is great all the staff are friendly and helpful they give me the loan i needed.
I've banked with other financial institutions and none can top it.
It was rather rough banking in a state that never had a single nfcu branch.
Opened an account today.
From the security outside to the teller and bank representatives, my visit was easy, quick and reassuring.
They helped me with a fine loan as i had just flew back from europe and was short of cash.
I was very impressed by the drive thru service.
Banks are banks (just like cell phone companies).
Most products and services and fees are almost interchangeable, you have to find the one that fits your needs.
To me, this was a great example as to why i like to bank with wells fargo.
Have 3 open accounts and 2 credit cards with chase.
Went into this branch today to open a 4th account.
Cordial and friendly, definitely keen on service.
They also have drive thru service which is convenient.
I wasn't very impressed with this bank.
They will charge you fees if you don't have enough money in your checking account doesn't meet certain min.
So the business bank accounts are not technically free.
The upside is that this bank is very good at financing its customers with line of credits.
The reason is because they have all the money!
The customer service is excellent.
These guys could give customer service lessons to the downtown branch.
Really nice people and clean, slick looking bank.
Customer service at this location is outstanding!
Great bank  staff is all ways there to help.
I have had an account here for more than 20 years.
I have both a personal and business account here.
My bank was bought out by alerus.
I hate going inside of the bank, when possible i always use the drive thur.
I worked with jacob d. i gotta say he really changed my mind about my anxiety with bankers.
He was really helpful and really took the time to explain to me on what's going with my bank account.
As mos t banks, avoid during payday fridays during lunch and around rush hour or you will be stuck !
I have been a client for two years and appreciate the great personal service they offer all their clients.
My favorite bank in over 35 years of banking in arizona.
I was surprised that this bank had not been reviewed yet.
This bank of america location is just okay.
Yanira assisted me for a loan had great attitude, funny and easy going.
I just moved here and needed a new bank account.
I got a new account right away!
My experience was definitely a 5 star service.
I refinanced my high interest car loan here and was pleasantly surprised at how low the interest rate was.
You can't beat the no fee checking.
Never thought to review a bank until receiving such stellar service!
Used to bank with az federal cu, but no longer.
I now do all my banking with oneaz!
Great service and i love the smell, the energy and the layout!
Customer service is very good and very attentive!
Good customer service goes a long way.
The bank is clean.
Was able to open an account quickly and with amazing customer service.
Pcg can even help with equipment loans and fuel.
They have good service.
Fast service and the building was cleaned and organized.
Referred to me by a co-worker, i joined dvcu back in 2014 with just a simple checking and savings account.
Other banks could take some lessons from this team!
This place has the best service of all rapid cash locations.
No one wants to come in for a loan, but when you need it to, its as painless as possible.
Always does a great job for me and i appreciate her service.
Best customer service ever!
Larry keever has been in the industry for a long time and knows how to provide great service to customers.
Banked with boa for years.
If you need a loan ask if you qualify...
Awesome staff and service!
Plus, midfirst is an amazing bank in general.
'scot more money than me.
The best way to change money these days is just to withdraw it when you get there.
Wow, after reading the reviews here on yelp i decided to open a bank account at pinnacle.
I've never been treated so good by any other bank.
Personalized attention and a free checking account.
Can't speak on the customer service because came here on a saturday.
4 stars for saving me $6.99 and being the closest.
I always have a good experience at this bank, and it's been our bank for years.
Don't know her name but she didn't care to service me and it really showed.
Loans are generally $100 to $2,500.
This chase bank has been at this location for over 20 years.
The tellers are friendly and quick and the personal bankers are nice as well.
I am happy with the support i get from bank of america.
I highly recommend everyone to signup with bank of america at this location.
Great customer service from bofa banker gladis!
Wanda is an account whiz and is extremely personable.
I used to be with bofa, customer service was 2 stars at best...  horrible account representation which made us leave.
This office provides a service that is truly a cut above the rest!
I love the customer service here.
Another scotiabank with useless hours.
If you want top of the line banking customer service this this rocks!
I don't know much about $100,000 fishermen's loans in nova scotia.
Everything you could ask for in a gym.....classes, equipment, swimming, basketball courts, track, lockers and towel service!
I absolutely love this bank!
They definitely gave me a different outlook on banking!
So far, we have taken out four car loans and a boat loan.
The online loan process is simple, and our approval came back instantly after hitting the submit button.
Also reopened my savings, great manager who gave me a temporary debit card when i lost my wallet.
Would definitely recommend setting up an account through them.
M molloy provided a great service and was tremendously helpful throughout all three of my financings he helped me with.
With all the hostility held towards banks now-a-days, this branch has been nothing but accommodating and friendly.
I went to this bank at noon on a friday.
I thought the service was prompt and helpful.
I liked the service.
I have even considered switching because of the great consistency in customer service.
No reason to bank anywhere else!
Update: turns out they dont allow transfering of money to family members that have discover bank.
Will change to another bank as soon as they paid out the $300 new customer bonus.
I am very happy with the service i get...
I don't feel like "just another customer" like at the big banks...
The people there are always on it with service.
This bank is fantastic!
Overall, i would definitely recommend banking here!
Absolutely love this bank (how it is possible to love a bank, i honestly don't know).
He is a humble and knowledgeable banker.
Arizona needs to keep their money local and not to the cut and dry big banks.
We were looking to re-finance our truck loan and canyon state delivered.
Rate is awesome, service was excellent and we couldn't be happier.
I have had nothing but excellent experiences with them from account opening, to notary service to shared branching, etc.
I would highly recommend them over any traditional bank.
I continue to have outstanding service at this bank.
However, we have had wonderful service from eric as well as the branch manager.
This is not my bank just cashing a check from a client whom happens to bank here...
Anyhow customer service is quality no finger prints needed to cash a check either.
I just opened a business account at this bank today.
I am looking forward to working with pinnacle bank for many years.
I am feeling confident in my purchases and will be a loyal jos a bank customer for a long time.
Even though my account is with a different out-of-state credit union, the staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful to me.
Daniela was great at customer service, as was the manager assisting her.
I expect i will open an account with them soon!
I opened an account and applied for a credit card.
Wells fargo bank is lucky to have him.
Went to pay my home equity loan today.
If you need a business account, this is the place to go!
Knows what to do to handle your account and make banking a breeze.
Totally worth the pain of switching banks!
I've had a bank account here for almost a year and my experience has been an ok one.
This is actually the first bank i've banked with and i think its been a good learning experience.
Honestly i don't think i'll be banking here for very long but until then this is a good starter bank.
I have been banking with wells for a few years now.
I have been a customer with sce for many years and the service is always exceptional.
Sce beltway/sahara - a great place for banking.
I will always come to her as she is amazing and a huge asset to josh a banks.
What i like most about this branch is that (*knock on wood*) i've always gotten fast and friendly service here.
The employees are really friendly and the service is very good here.
This bank is everything i need.
I wouldn't trade banking with nfcu for any other!
I have never had a problem with them and their customer service is above other places i have banked with.
They even waived some fees to get money sent out.
My experience at this chase bank started out in the parking lot.
Everyone at this bank has always gone out of there way to help us make good financial decisions.
We highly recommend this bank!!
I researched banks and credit unions and saw that sunwest credit union was highly rated and had free checking.
So today i went in and opened the account.
Hate having to go to the bank, but at least this place makes it just a bit better.
Went to the bank to deal with some change of address, etc.
This is great bank.
Remember when banking was personal well midfirst is what banking used to be.
Their friendly knowledgeable staff have worked with us on our personal banking and business banking.
They also have a great kids program for savings.
The service at this location is always excellent.
We used their safety deposit box service which worked very well for us, and was always very easy to access.
Personal bankers are awesome about account issues and super friendly.
They have opened a new world of banking for me with online banking .
Who's looking for a bank to do notarization on our sons cremation plot at the cemetery.
None of the banks do notary anymore have to go to ups or fedex store.
I'm sure it's part of them maintaining profitability but unfortunately customer service times are long.
Better than taking out a loan a payday loan or going to dollar loan center.
Chase bank has always been good to me.
Great service, always fully  staffed!
Our hoa also banks with this same branch.
I really like how concerned they are about our accounts.
Their customer service is always on point and i'm always greeted with smiles.
This is the  best run wells fargo bank i have ever been too.
The bankers are friendly and very knowledgable.
This will be the 3rd time i've added a bank into yelp!
The bank of open 9-5 m-f and 9-1 on saturday.
I'm mad at myself for ever dealing with banks when i could have been using a credit union.
They say that banking can be comfortable (have you gone through the mortgage process?!?)
And that they're voted #1 customer service for years.
This bank in particular is well staffed at the teller counter.
The financial service reps are all helpful and they're willing to answer questions.
I've never had an issue with this particular bank and everyone is always pleasant.
So maybe banking can be this comfortable?
Great service all the way around!
I've been banking at the bell and tatum branch and i've always received excellent service.
Everyone there is very professional and courteous and i've never had any account opened without my permission.
This location is my favorite place to bank because it's not crowded and busy like other places.
On the inside...well, it's a bank, you can imagine.
Overall, this is a nice, quiet location to get your banking done.
We all have a favorite place to bank and so do i.  i love banking with desert schools.
I love the fact that their notary services are free.
The staff there is always helpful and i don't feel pressured to buy into any of their services.
If you are new to the area and need a bank i recommend desert schools over all the others.
Opened an account a couple of weeks ago.
Very good customer service.
We opened a few accounts and applied for a loan.
A few days later, the account manager called to tell us the loan was approved.
They've also recently added e-banking and online bill pay.
I'm interested in banks lowering my fees, expanding hours, making e-banking easier, and giving me a decent rate.
That is what sunwest is obviously spending their money on.
I really appreciate that--they aren't wasting money on things that don't matter.
After having been through a few national banks i have finally found a great branch with amazing tellers.
Sec is a great bank that offers amazing service with great banking options.
(he told me that the bank errand was long, but not boring.)
Very friendly and customer service oriented.
Very professional and great customer service!
What a breath of fresh air after having a nightmare experience with bank of america.
I greatly appreciate your wonderful customer service and professionalism!
Great customer service here.
They are so helpful and always see to your needs the moment you enter the bank.
Their online banking interface is great with quicken.
I cannot believe i am yelping about a bank, but here is why.
About 6 years ago i was with another squirrel hill bank.
I swore up and down that these guys new what customer service is...the i moved to pnc.
I was wrong about my bank.
-a bank sans tellers?
-forgot your account number?
I get calls from them about once every 2 months (not annoying, but don't feel ignored) to diversify my money.
Good ol' customer service.
A+++++ i will never use another branch or bank!
The customer service was top notch!!!!
Just needed to deposit some money, in and out of the branch in less than 5 minutes.
Customer service is always above average.
Never go inside and do almost all my banking needs through the atm.
It's free for anyone with td account, otherwise they charge something close to 10%, which is pretty fricking steep.
I've banked at this credit union for over a year now.
Recommended it to several friends whom also bank there now.
Tellers are pleasant; service is fairly quick.
You can get a debit card the same day you open an account, and funds deposited are usually available immediately.
Very helpful tellers and bank officers.
I like the no fee checking they offer which no other bank in phoenix offered me.
This place has amazing service.
The service is good but this location doesn't have lockers.
My wife has an account here.
She is always happy with the service she gets here.
Only hang us as with most banked now they have closed the drive up teller.
The part i get most benefit from is we can get money for europe and other countries we travel to.
The bank i use most does not do this so that is a big plus for me.
Account setup was easy.
Got a call from member services providing me my account information as well as how to navigate their online system.
They offered me additional credit services that i also qualified for.
She took my account info and i was contacted by a member later that day who helped assist me.
I was looking for a new business bank for my small business.
My wife found comerica bank by reading the rave reviews online.
I went into the central and osborn location and was blown away by their amazing customer service.
They spent almost 2 hours with me helping me get the proper paperwork to open an account.
Based upon my experience i am also moving over my household personal accounts to this bank as well.
I highly comerica bank and especially the brank at central and osborn.
I visited on monday 10/31 and was assisted by a banker named deorella.
It is friday 11/4 and the amount has been credited back to my account without any fee.
They had money in the 24hr atms.
2 drive thru's (atm)  i've only been inside once but the service was prompt.
I have been a chase bank customer for years, this particular location is close to my house.
This branch is spacious, well lit, clean and the customer service is great.
They offer drive-thru service and have more than one location.
I have been a member of 1st bank since last november.
Absolutely recommend banking at 1st bank!
If it wasn't for the long lines, this place would be 5-star bank for sure.
Yes, it is a bank but it is my neighborhood bank that has fast friendly services.
Besides teller service they offer all banking services to meet your needs.
Never had any problems only to receive outstanding customer service.
One of the other bank employees helped us to the car while holding an umbrella over us.
That is amazing customer service!!
Bottom line...don't be afraid here, the interest rates are more frightening than the bank itself.
Great service , very helpful and respectful service,highly recommend!!
I got into the bank and got an immediate service ,the guy was very helpful and fast!!
Overall, this is a pretty basic bank.
Pnc bank is pretty ubiquitous across pittsburgh (guess what the p in pnc stands for).
Would love to this bank on a heartbeat but too far to go now, not.
It's nice when a neighborhood bank treats you like a neighbor.
I have always had good customer service here.
They have really good rates with their loans and friendly staff.
Services are accessible remotely online and they give reimbursement on any of the atm fees.
So much pressure... ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  hard to believe i could like any bank.
But this one branch of a wells fargo bank definitely is an oasis in this desert town.
Even during christmas and right before any holiday they provide good service.
It's a small bank that really gets to know its long term regular customers like my relatives.
Overall it's a relatively pain free banking experience mainly cuz they're quick.
It's down the street and i always get awesome service.
I bank with the main giants.
Wells fargo is one of those giant banks.
I am going to review the service of the location.
So if you want a review on the evils of big bank america, you won't find it here.
I remember hearing that wells fargo did this for free if you have a certain account.
Overall if i needed to do some banking at wells fargo i will most likely be at this branch.
I just left this branch after opening up a business checking account with manny ramirez.
He was easy to talk to, did not push any unwanted products, and had great all-around customer service.
Thanks again manny, look forward to doing more banking with you guys in the future!
She made me feel very comfortable and confident in the loan.
I've been with sunwwest for 4 years now and have been consistently happy with the service they provide.
I always recieve friendly customer srevice, timely respnses, and will continue to bank with them.
The staff is incredibly helpful and they know customer service.
I use this wells fargo for business banking and i have always had great customer service here.
Sometimes the lines can get long but that is the case with any bank.
I've had a navy federal account since i was 2 years old.
Almost forgot, it is a credit union and their rates on loans and mortgages are phenomenal.
Best in town, never known a bank that will go out of their way to help you.
We are super grateful for the advice, service, and time.
Very satisfied with their service.
They were both fabulous, answered all my questions and solved all my banking problems.
A+ for customer service.
Is this something new at banks not accepting cash.
This bank is amazing!
The customer service is bar none exceptional.
Great service is beautiful.
I had a large cheque to toss into my account.
The cheque from from another bank and i was prepared they'd put the whole amount on hold.
The manager came in, reviewed my case, and asked me how much money i needed right away.
There always seems to be a promotion for opening a checking account.)
On this trip, i tried to wire some money from the account.
I'd normally be somewhat indifferent to a bank branch, but i had a really great experience with this one.
I must say that td canada trust is canada's best big bank.
I personally give td 3-stars meaning they are ok, but not exceptional as compared to non-bank private enterprises.
The service is always absolutely top notch, specifically joe, who i seem to always have as my teller mid-day.
Love the friendly bankers and now both of my daughter's and husband have opened accounts with them.
How can you not give this bank a 5-star?
It opens on sunday, most banks don't.
It extend their business hours mondays thru fridays, most banks don't.
Really enjoy banking with this bank, check them out.
They have great customer service and remember who i am every single time.
Great customer service at this location.
I've been banking here since 2011.
I always get great service here!
Though i may not like the bank their service was faster than many of their other branches.
Old fashioned customer attention & service.
I've had to do multiple money orders/card replacements/account opening/account merging operations here and never had any problems.
Drive through banking/atm's as well as a 24/7 outdoor atm available.
Sending kudos to roberto borges the customer service manager (i don't know where he's located) !!!
Good bank, fast with loan processing.
Went to midfirst bank today for the first time & met andrea hathaway who is the asst.
This bank has 5 star employees!
Quick, easy & great customer service.
I have been a member of this bank for a very long time.
If you are looking for a bank to join, this one is definitely one that you should consider.
This bank has its ups and downs for me.
Your requirments are lame and i already have an account with wells fargo.
I've used this wells fargo for years and have always had prestigious service.
I've only ever had two problems with my accounts and they quickly fixed them.
This bank is very convenient and close to my house.
Definitely makes going to the bank a lot of easier.
Clean interior, not as nice as some of the other branches interior design but it's still a great bank :)
I love this bank!
They are like family at this point and i have cancelled my chase bank account.
I do ally banking at this location and they know me by name.
You can't get that kind of service at the larger banks.
Closed my account with wells fargo today, and opened one here at chase.
Jesus, helped us open a new account, and we couldn't be more please with his service.
We will be back to open a joint account soon with you :)
The locker rooms are nice, clean and towel service is awesome.
Thing about banks, (my 2 cents)they need to have good listening skills.
Okay, i am giving this location five stars but the actual bank three stars after my recent experience.
So again, your mobile banking app says the deposit is made and you now have a positive balance, yay!
Banks are making billions of dollars off consumers with nsf fees.
Dana (bank manager) and the staff here are very helpful and know their stuff!
I don't ever carry my card and i haven't memorized my account number, but it doesn't matter.
Bank to rent tuxes for our wedding.
There is towel service which is always great (i hate laundry).
The service is getting slower, especially during lunch time drive-thru wait time.
Need to fix time or you'll drive people away to another banks.
When i have had some issues with my account they have always been happy to take care of it.
The banker eventually came and handled the rest of the process.
Outstanding customer service, knowledge, and management.
Don't waste your time with other banks.
Even though large, wells fargo feels like a community bank.
I really only pop in here for the atm, i don't bank with chase because of their fees.
The atm is inside the bank,its very clean and air conditioned.
Jackie chiu one of the bank assistants at bmo smiled and came to help when i mentioned my difficulties.
The bank was actually closed but jackie gave me all the time i needed.
If all the workers at this new bmo branch are like jackie, i would open an account immediately.
Really great banking experience.
He assisted our organization in updating account information and was attentive to any questions we had.
Just left the bank and have nothing but positive feedback for tori wilson.
She has excellent customer service and was very patient.
If you to speak with a banker, please ask for tori!
This chase bank has very friendly and helpful staff members.
The girls that work at this bank are very sweet.
Brittany has helped me with my online banking and has shown me how to use it.
All of the girls are really very sweet they are my bank.
I enjoy banking because the service they give me is just really great.
I'd recommend this bank to anyone and everyone!
5-star staff and service!
Opening an account could not have been easier nor could it have been more pleasant.
This bank is wonderful!
Sean signed me and my boyfriend up for a few accounts and he was just great.
He even did a follow up call a few days later to make sure our accounts were going okay.
I have been in this bank 3 times since i got an account and everytime was a fantastic experience.
Very happy with this bank & lucky its only a minute away :)
This is a big bank with branches all over the city of charlotte.
So you'd think this banking institution would have remarkably fabulous customer service.
The south blvd branch,  like many other branches of bank of america, no longer offer drive thru service.
My only account now is a mortgage account that i haven't had the energy to move yet to another bank.
All my other accounts are with competitors that all offer drive thru banking.
Pack your patience or search for branches that still offer drive thru service.
Their customer service is top notch.
What makes compass any better than any other bank?
They refund other banks atm fees!
I've always had great customer service at this location and staff are always friendly and ready to help.
Seriously, i almost never think of a bank as "my bank"...
Just wonderful customer service.
I chose this bank based on the great reviews and i have not been disappointed.
I'm so happy i chose pinnacle bank.
Love banking with chase, especially this location.
The bankers and tellers are super friendly and very knowledgeable.
The absolute best customer service.
Love banking at this branch!
I went right from the gas station to the national bank on york st.
Lourdes was one of the best customer service experiences i have ever had in toronto.
Also she said , " do you has your bank card?"
They have been charging my minor child a $12 maintenance fee for her account for months.
I askes isabel if i could speak with a banker.
She explain to me the type of account i has.
Let's recap: i am here for my daughters account.
After a good 10 minute argument she made me an appointment 2 hours out with a banker.
So i went to a teller to draw every penny out of every one of my accounts.
I'm just floored that i trust this bank  with my money when they give isabel access to a computer.
Do yourself a favor...dump your cold, greedy bank and become a member.
I have a seen a lot of negative reviews for this bank and wanted to give it a fair rating.
I don't think a bank should get one star because someone didn't get 5000 in 100 dollar bills.
What makes a bank is how they treat their customers overall.
I have never had an issue with this bank and they have always been kind to me.
Deer valley credit union in glendale is a wonderful banking branch.
They are all knowledgeable and never fall short on demonstrating superb customer service skills.
This is a very good bank branch, folks.
This bank has a friendly and upbeat vibe.
The most important part is that the service is very quick (which i really appreciate when i'm in a hurry).
Banks suck, credit unions rock.
I use banks as little as possible, preferring instead the no-hassle credit union environment.
Banks only care about the quarterly report to their shareholders, and they make all those profits off of you!
Best community bank in town!
Voted #1 community bank in arizona 3 years in a row, by ranking arizona.
I come in with cash and deposit it into an account.
This is a well-preserved bank with a retro-style foyer and banking area.
The business account people like me are ushered into the back area and queue up between our own velvet ropes.
Customer service is excellent.
I recently opened a checking and savings account here and i was teamed up with kristen wright.
Fast drive-thru window, great location, fast service and clean lobby.
I also banked at chase, bofa, us bank and a couple of other small credit unions.
Dvcu is honestly hands down the best experience i've had with banking so far.
I would recommend dvcu to anyone who is tired of the big banks.
Jm went out of his way to provide excellent customer service.
Walking into a banking establishment and having the tellers know your name!
I was banking at wells fargo and thank the lord i found this gem!!!
The costumer service is amazing and there isn't surprise fees you'll see pulled from your account every month.
If you are thinking about switching i highly recommend this bank!!
For a big bank they don't make me feel like number.
In a day when most of our bank transactions are electronic, who cares about bank branches, right?
I have done all my banking here for years.
If you qualify for an account here and do not open one you are only hurting yourself.
I called ahead of time to ask what i needed to bring in to get a checking account.
I'm not a vet, but i have a joint account here.
Account maintenance is easy and everything's accessible online.
The customer service here is off the charts, these guys are friendly, professional and truly care about you.
And then in only a few minutes, we were off for more adventures with money in our pockets again.
I still will continue to bank here.
Took care of my service and bid me a happy easter.
Nice and courteous with fast service.
I'm a first time home buyer and my realtor recommended home street loan to me .
Service is usually quick enough.
Nice, quiet, and clean bank.
I love this bank.
This is one of my local scotiabanks.
I'll agree with chris p - the hours are not great, but no bank has good hours these days.
All in all a great bank....
Went in saturday to open an account and were greeted by blake as soon as we walked in.
Our new favorite home-town bank!
So what were we to do but head over to the bank.
Great quickie trip to the bank.
As a member of nfcu since 1991, i have seen it evolve into a world class banking institution.
With their online banking, phone service, bill pay and e-deposit.
I find i no longer need to go to their branch for my banking needs.
Their customer service is also excellent and nfcu is known for their generous credit lines and low interest rates.
If you qualify, i highly recommend nfcu for all  your banking needs.
I go here even though they constantly take my money.
I just found out she left jos a banks to go work at infinity selling new cars.
I'm sure she will be number one there as she was for three years at jos a banks.
Full service inside safeway anything you need done they can do.
Friendly service top notch.
I felt very welcomed and the customer service was top notch.
The banker addressed all my concerns.
I've enjoyed banking specifically with this wells fargo branch location for over a decade.
They've assisted in transferring, linking and renaming our accounts.
I think she was finished crediting my account within 90 seconds.
Ralph (personal banker) thew a boomerang with me...took a negative and slashed it to a glorious positive.
Recently had a charge that blew a flurry into my checking account.
It's a bank, nothing to get too excited about folks.
My husband rick and i have our mortgage here and our checking and savings accounts.
This branch is also remodeled and support all bank products such as investment and mortgage.
It took me over 20 mins before i was able to make my withdraw, simply not good service at all.
Great customer service everytime i come into this location as well.
I just relocated to scottsdale and needed to open a new bank account.
I'm happy to be a part of this local bank!
He is a great addition to the bank
This is a very friendly banking center.
The tellers and bankers are all very helpful and eager to help.
There isn't a better bank staff.
