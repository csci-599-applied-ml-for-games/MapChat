I went in with what felt like a laundry list of items to accomplish.
They are personable here and really take time to make sure you are taken care of.
I was moving back to las vegas for work and wanted to buy a house.
I did a lot of research in finding a mortgage broker and ended up going with casey.
What first impressed me is that she was very quick to respond to my email and voicemail.
She did not try to hard pressure sell me on anything but just genuinely wanted to help.
She was dependable and honest when explaining my expectations.
She worked diligently to keep me up to date on the process throughout the entire loan from start to finish.
I can tell she had her systems in place and a great team to work with.
I will be recommending her to all my friends and family!
I went in the branch to open an account.
I was helped by a wonderful lady named shelly.
She made the experience amazing in setting me up.
Answered all the questions i had opening up an account and being my first credit union.
The perks they have are awesome and that i'm happy i got to sign up at this location!
Staff knows you by name, always friendly and funny.
Very helpful with helping you better understand your banking options and needs.
I highly recommend this branch!
Scott goes above and beyond for his clients and always does it with a smile

I live in colorado, bow customer there.
I walked in on new year's eve, had some needs.
They were open and rosie couldn't have been more friendly or helpful.
Answered every single question, processed things smoothly, great sense of humor.
They had these green "excellent" strips facing the customer.
I believe so that is the customer expects that level of service.
Interesting technique - it seems to work!
I liked her so much i mentioned her to jeff, the branch manager.
Go see rosie and tell her scott from colorado said hi!
Bus will take you half a block from this bank.
Mary is a great professional and a dedicated supporter of the community.
She is knowledgeable and always available to provide insight and advice.
Definitely someone who you should look to for advice and guidance.
Veteran from 1989 and finally switched all my banking over to usaa..
I should have done this when i first learned about usaa...
Member now for about 4 years, great customer service, and all their apps work great, !!
I can not speak highly enough of usaa.
I am posting my review at this location because it was this location that helped me set everything up.
I've been with usaa for checking and savings since 2015.
The lady on the phone made it very simple and explained all options to me.
You could tell she enjoyed her job and helping people out, and that's what makes usaa so great.
They've gone above and beyond expectations and have treated me and my family very well for many years.
Thank you usaa, you have earned my business and i will continue to do all types of business with you.
Come to think of it, i may just apply for a job here!
Everyone is always happy and more than happy to help.
Keep up the great work guys!
So, i'm a huge fan of credit unions.
And started issuing flimsy atm cards that cracked easily with a 10 dollar replacement fee.
I opened a new account a desert schools.
The service is great.
Putting a hold on my cashiers check from a fellow shared branching network credit union was asinine and unnecessary.
But seriously, what's the point of cashiers checks if you put a hold on them?
Calling them for fund verification is a pain or something?
Regina petty and adam martinez were awesome.
Super quick to respond to my questions and confirming they received my documents.
And they went at lightning speed to make the signing for closing convenient for me.
I was super happy at how painless the process was.
I like this bank.
Of course i visit several different wells fargo throughout the valley.
This one i have gone to several times.
At times the smell can be over whelming inside.
Which many are not!!
As in all the other branches i go to.
Also the drive up window is great as well!
Sadly enough they must have some incidents there.
I like wells fargo, highly recommend them..
Sorry but, way better than bofa!
They do their job correctly.
Never had a problem..... who reviews banks?
I understand corporate banks but i mean i have too much time on my hands if i'm rating a bank
I would suggest anybody who banks with traditional banks give credit union one a try thanks
Best bank and branch around!
Very friendly and knowledgeable staff!
They explain everything no hidden fees.
Great rates and awesome accounts!
Plus how awesome is it to have a bank right where you workout!?
Another advantage is the manager is certified in investments and very smart.
I highly suggest everyone go to this branch.
They are the best one i've been too!
Unbelievable customer service and know how from heather white, one of the bankers there.
She is extremely knowledgeable, professional and down to earth.
The place is very nice inside, super clean, nicely decorated, very inviting.
Brand new computers and printers, clean bathroom nice sitting area, well lit.
I never heard about this place before.
I will be closing all my accounts at my 2 other credit unions and just deal with vantage west.
I will also be recommending it every chance i get!
Rarely ever a line and excellent customer service!
What more can you ask for?
Usaa is the best of the best of the best.
They know what they're doing everything from their website navigation, user friendly online banking, and their superb customer service.
Well, empire records quote out of the way, i have been with usaa ever since... forever.
I was grandfathered in under my dad who is a retired usaf lt.
Whenever i called them about anything their customer service representatives have been angels.
But every time they have been great.
Going on 9 years now they have never let me down.
As soon as i snag myself a full time job i am moving my checking account over to usaa.
They offer direct deposit and deposit from home.
I hate that and knowing i could get that money back would be awesome.
My plan is to be with usaa forever.
I have no reason to switch to anyone else.
They've been in my family for a long time.
Everyone at the summerlin branch is always helpful, friendly and accommodating.
They go out of their way to assist members.
Tops in their field.
Best oncu office around!
Open until 2pm on saturday = las vegas weekend gambling savior.
Ample parking, can't remember if they had a drive-thru atm, but i'm sure they do.
Oh, and lollipops at the counter.
Full disclosure: i am only a client.
Having said that, i am honestly quite stunned at the negative reviews.
Trust me, i am not easy to please.
In fact, i hired cie taylor because another sf agent was a total &%$# to work with and a liar.
There is one review here that i take issue with.
People make mistakes, i have made many, but i judge people/companies by how they handle or resolve them.
Yelp is a microcosm.
Even my review (which is outstandingly accurate btw) should be considered as just one person.
If you are deciding to get insurance with sf, then i highly recommend cie taylor.
See as i have, how friendly they really are.
I love love love this bank.
They are super friendly to me and my family.
We come in once a week as regulars and it's always an in and out along with great costumer service.
I've had bad experience at other banks and always felt they were setting me up for failure always felt cheated.
Fees every time for everything.i've been with us bank for 4 years now and i seriously can't say enough.
She was so nice and friendly and helped me set up my business account!
I applied for a auto loan refinance at a very attractive 2.98%.
From the initial call to signing the documents it took 4 business days and a very smooth transaction.
I met with monika m. today at the branch where she had all documents ready to be reviewed and signed.
Thank you for a professionalism and attention to detail.
Well, my review my differ from the others, but my experience at this bank of america has always been excellent.
Take today for example:  as i walk through the front door i am greeted warmly by the manager.
There are only two customers in line, and two tellers, each helping a customer.
In less than three minutes one of the customers is done and the teller says he can help me out.
The teller was friendly and made small talk while he took care of my transaction.
Then, the bank manager wishes me a good day as i'm walking out the front door.
I was in and out the bank in less than 5 minutes.
That's honestly as good of an experience as anyone can ever expect.
Once again margrett mims is the best!
Very helpful and knowledgable.
Thank you very much!
This office goes above & beyond to take care of your needs!
We've used them for auto insurance, mortgage insurance & even life insurance.
We worked personally with dawn neitzel and she was awesome!
Us bank is awesome!
Since i've made the switch to us bank i've been much happier.
Fees and the tellers are way friendlier and way more helpful.
I highly recommend us bank, especially the one on e sunset rd or the one by windmill & eastern.
A bank for those of us who work banker's hours.
Got a cheque languishing in our wallet for months?
Take it over to td to open a new account.
Not pushy about what to do with your money.
Open later in the evening and early part of saturday.
The folks here know what to do to get your money where you want it.
I wish i could give more stars for bay equity.
Talk about a team that really goes above and beyond.
Jessica pingleton, adam and hannah boles are beyond amazing.
They held my hand through the whole process.
They made this whole process so easy on us and put up with all of our changes.
If you are looking for help with a home loan do not hesitate to call the a-team.
Wonderful people to work with!
I highly recommend bay equity!
Thank you again you jessica,adam and hannah!!
While on vacation, went in to get some cash.
Nice , clean location, staff were very friendly.
Financial service representative kyle miller was very helpful.
He is knowledgeable about the various products, and provided all the information i needed to open an account.
Very friendly and professional.
We would give ken 10 stars if possible.
Ken and his team are the best.
This is the bank inside the smith's store.
The staff have always been extremely friendly and helpful.
There is a full service bank branch in the same parking lot (why?
Who knows...), and we prefer to go to the store branch due to their customer service and general personalities.
Banking the errand that we all dislike.
I got stuck with it this week!
Usually, the lovely computer does all of the banking with the proper stroke on the keyboard.
Alas the numbers do not add up so here i am.
While here noticed that the bank is dead; and thirty minutes before closing.
Must be luck in my corner.
He was attentive to meet my needs as a customer.
The associate helping me asked all the proper questions about what the issue was with the account.
It was a very simple fix come to find out.
My only other request of this fabulous associate was if they sold stamps.
They used too; but not anymore.
This wells fargo is normally out my way, but feel quality or quantity is something we settle for.
Way to go wells fargo remembering that we (your customers) choose you!
I'm not sure where all these negative reviews are coming from.
I just went to this bank to open a checking account/saving account and boy was i welcomed properly.
I can see why my grandfather has banked with this local state charter bank for years.
Not only are my every needs taken care off but every employee seems to always be happy to help you!
Also a military friendly bank!
I really appreciate them helping me today on my transition from civilian life to military life.
Thank you nevada state bank!
It was in 2011.
She hugged me & i feel like the employees here are like family since then.
Unfortunately, she is no longer at this location.
However, everyone here is like that still.
Edgar offered us water when we walked in.
The drive-up teller didn't have any cars coming thru so she came over to help the tellers.
Phil came in from his short break & offered us a water again on the way out.
Cindy the manager was behind the tellers greeting everyone in line & as you walk up to the teller.
If the line is long, everyone pulls together w/ a smile on their face to quickly help.
The only negative is the parking lot.
No big deal when you get exceptional customer service that is sometimes tough to find.
Thank you st. rose wells fargo!
She was friendly and didn't rush, even knowing it was past their business hours.
I've been a life-long customer of td bank which then became td canada trust with a merge decades ago.
Still, staff are pleasant and efficient; they totally understand your wait frustration so please don't take it out on them!
I prefer online banking.
Sometimes i have must use one of four green machine self-serve banking atms at the scarborough town centre branch.
My time is valuable!
Bank hours are quite broad so that's a plus!
Atm almost always works perfectly.
Drive up atm mostly has zero lines.
Been a customer for years, hope services stay all great.
These guys have become my go-to moneychangers for foreign exchange purchases.
Payment by cash, interac, or combination thereof.
And the best part:  far, far better rates than my banks offer me, buying and selling back both.
Great office, great location.
They are very helpful and resourceful.
They also validate parking!
The only person willing to put in the effort to make things right was melissa.
She dealt with both my husband and i in person and through numerous phone calls.
Really grateful to work with a reliable and honest employee who shows us that she cares about us.
I have been in many, many banks in my life, and most of them have been decent at best.
A bowl full of dums dums, maybe some peppermints, one time there was even a bushel apples.
Needless to say, i have never been impressed with any snack selections these places have had to offer.
That is, until i walked intomidfirst bank, though.
These guys brought the mother flipping heat.
I'm talking suckers up the wazoo.
Every kind of mint you can imagine.
Those strawberry candies with the gooey stuff in the middle.
The strawbrrry candies with the gooey stuff in the middle except with pineapple instead of stawberry.
Five stars, hecking brilliant.
I have just become enamored of the ability to deposit through the atm!
For the most part, the desk service here is what you would expect from your average bank.
I have had some fantastic experience with the bankers in particular.
I've always been a fan of us bank and this branch lives up to what i have come to expect.
I was over at chase bank the other day along with my mom to open a new checking account.
He was meticulous and very patient in answering her many questions.
They certainly have many safety features (22) you can choose from to bank online via your cell phone.
I recommend chase bank to everyone.
Some of the nicest people at a bank i have ever met.
Keep  up the great work and the great customer service.
I will always enjoy going to this location in n. scottsdale..
When it comes to banking, i am all over the place.
What i want from a bank is straight forward answers.
David, the financial manager at this branch and the one further up on eastern, did just that.
Ultimately, even though they are not my primary bank, i would not hesitate to consolidate my funds over to chase.
Opened an account with pat today, great customer service and took the time to answer all of our questions!
One of the only locations with available lock boxes, if anyone is in need.
I was in search for a lock box and luckily this locations had available boxes.
I was greeted promptly and was assisted w/in 20 minutes.
The process was easy and they have a great, friendly staff!
The george team is great!
They always provide weekly calls with updates and they always put the client first!
There is a larger and shinier boa down the street a bit from this one.
Is boa going for the starbucks business model?
Anyways usually i like them big and shiny, but in this case i prefer this boa.
Instead you're in a nice comfy air conditioned little glass cube.
Don't lie you know you've done it before!
I love that we still have solid american companies still around that value and appreciate veterans of this great country.
Usaa has been my one stop shop for banking, insurance, car buying service, life insurance, and financial advice.
Thank you usaa you are the best!
After visiting other chase locations seeking the same consistent information, we visited this location and spoke with zachary.
He will remain legendary through his high quality of service provided.
In fact the whole team provided clear expectations and delivered.
I recently had one of the best banking experiences i've ever had at this branch.
I'm really happy with the customer service here, will definitely be back.
I came in here to get a 300 bonus for opening up a checking account.
I didn't have to wait too long, but the process took about 30 minutes and i was late for work.
Art and margaret went above and beyond all expectations while helping me set up an account with one nevada.
I love this credit union already!
I've consistently found the tellers at this location provide better service than those in standalone branch buildings.
Lines are shorter too.
Atm always super convenient.
I recently purchased a home and used one nevada credit union for mortgage lending and insurance services.
I got quotes from several of the big banks and no one could match their rate or their closing costs.
I could not be happier with the service i received.
I highly recommend one nevada credit union for your banking, lending and insurance needs.
I have had accounts with them since 2001 and have never had a single negative experience.
I love this bank!
Im happy i bank with them.
Best bank i've banked with.
What's not to love.
The staff here are consistently happy and cheerful and helpful.
I was pleasantly surprised at the customer service offered at this location.
I am currently in the process of moving and while boxing things up misplaced my credit card.
:o  i'll admit when i walked in i felt unsure what to do, no one to greet me.
I looked to my left and there were people sitting, i looked to my right and people were in line.
I hopped in line and waited.
Moving closer to the front i could tell this line was to deposit or withdraw money.
Pretty much, useless to me.
Nevertheless i get to the front of the line and ask my question.
I left feeling satisfied.
I love that this location is right off the freeway so it is easy off, easy on.
I have to say that i have never been inside.
You almost have to drive in and then make a u-turn, unless there are no cars in the parking lot.
I was very pleased with this credit union the staff was extremely friend when we were opening up an account.
I have had credit unions in past.
The guy who helped us open the account was new cause his trainer was there helping him.
They both were very professional and polite.
The staff is so nice to me!
These people know the art of making work enjoyable.
They take the time to have a pleasant conversation with you, that goes beyond a transaction.
They even let me customize my debit card, which i don't think many know that you can do that.
Now i have pretty tulips on my card.
(love it)  thanks for going the extra mile!
I called this bank, and spoke with an actual human instead of a computer system telling me to select options.
I knew right then that was the bank for me.
I was so happy with the person to person contact and the customer service here.
I am so pleased with my choice to go with nevada state bank, and this branch in particular.
Kylee was very professional and courteous.
She made sure whatever i needed done was done right the first time.
My recent visit was handled really well by her and she gave me a really good experience.
As long as uwcu is around, i will be their customer.
They are an excellent bank that has never disappointed.
Excellent customer service, with the bank itself having a wonderfully inviting atmosphere, and free coffee never hurts!
Uwcu has got customer service completely figured out.
I actually enjoy doing business with usaa.... every time.
My wife and i have been long time members of mary contreras insurance.
And i feel that she does care for her clients like us.
Excellent service to mary and her staff.
I love chase bank!
I have never had any fraudulent charges on my account due to their wonderful service.
Chase is a great bank that i would highly recommend!
Yes it does exist!
I have used this branch many times.
Maybe enrique was too drunk to see it?
Lol  great location and easy access.
Always professional and great at sending out verification notices if they suspect fraud charges...great company!
She has exceeded my very high expectations with no reservations what so ever.
Thank you for everything casey!
Maria and travis made my experience a pleasure.
God at customer service.
Enjoyed going there and will continue .
Because of the good customer service.
This is the only well fargo i use but i have never been inside.
I am able to depost and withdrawl from the atm.
Always has been convenient.
I love using suntrust.
For many reasons but the best reason is the manager,  rafaeal .
I can't tell you how many times he fixed various problems i have had.
Just a wonderful family man who understands seniors.
Highly recommend his services.
Nora poblador was great when we came in.
She was very meticulous about making sure everything was done right and there would be no issues down the road.
Went in for my interview today and was just amazed at how huge this campus is.
You have to swipe a card to get through the door.
They have a starbucks and a sandwich shop, a cafeteria and a little shop with clothing and other things.
They also have a gym, a quiet room, a game room, physical therapist, nurse...
It was amazing, really hope i get this job (fingers crossed).
They are super friendly!
I felt like they really went the extra mile, making phone calls and following up with emails.
I would reccomend this branch to anyone in the area!
I'm giving this location 5 stars because of miguel!
He was very friendly, patient and helpful.
I had some problems with my account and he helped solve them.
I went in with a lot of questions and he answered every one.
I hope he's there the next time i go.
Also, ssa agents in las vegas do not honor any commitments made by ssa national hotline agents.
Everyone i've ever dealt with at this one nevada branch or by phone has been extremely courteous and helpful.
Such great people here.
Always fast and never an issue.
I always come to this one because of the workers.
And i just happen to live close.
But its easy access for cars in and out.
The tellers here are always the best.
They are always happy and move super fast.
I drive father than i need to just to come to this one.
I do all my business needs here.
All around atm thanks you.
This is a great place to do business.
The staff is friendly, knowledgeable, informative, and helpful.
They have great rates on loans and other financial tools that are also available on their website.
Getting refinance on my car.
I am a happy camper.
Love the customer service!
Everyone i've spoken to are so nice and professional.
I definitely recommend this place for anyone looking for insurance.
They treat you like family instead of just another customer or another number like most other banks.
Margaret and kyle are the very best banking professionals i have ever had the pleasure of doing business with.
That way you can get it fixed, and get whatever financial needs you are looking for.
They have the best rates across the board that i've seen.
They also have credit building tools such as 1k credit rebuilding loans.
As i said one nevada is the best and margaret and kyle are the best banking professionals.
Go see them and you'll see the difference between banking organizations that care and those that don't.
I can't stress enough how awesome margaret is and how awesome kyle is.
I have been banking with this credit union for over 30 years.
I also bank with chase, boa, and wells fargo.
Out of all of the banks, vantage west is by far superior.
I recently had a request to obtain statements for my accounts from 2011.
They all helped me and were tremendously friendly.
The entire staff are awesome!
I think i know almost every single persons name that work there and vice versa.
So now i'm glad to say that i am back as a loyal, happy customer.
They recently remodeled the place- so it looks more organized and updated.
But definitely their professionalism and friendliness overrides waiting in line for a few minutes !
I have been to this branch a few times.
It's nice enough for what it is.
Not too large and not too small.
Staff is friendly enough and always serve with a smile.
The parking lot asphalt is not in the greatest condition.
I try to avoid here because it's right next door to rainbow doughnuts.
If your from the islands and miss that ohana fill come down to aloha pacific you'll feel right at home.
The staff is so nice and they always welcome you with a friendly smile.
Candace boegeman was amazing.
She was charismatic over the phone and helped me with all of my concerns.
Dealing with your money can be overwhelming and stressful.
Her knowledge and comedic responses helped ease my anxiety.
The wait time time was around 5 minutes, which was to be expected during the middle of the day.
Stephanie answered the phone and was incredibly helpful and proactive in helping me.
This was the first time i called in, and i am glad that i chose summit.
She's a terrific asset to your one nev c u team.
Not only did he greet us but he made us feel very much at ease and comfortable about being there.
He not only gave us information on the bank itself but advised us on all the services they provide.
What struck me the most was that this is how banks used to be.
Open and friendly yet business like and not at all like the "big" banks out there.
The tellers welcome you and really enjoy being there.
We were offered cold bottled water which was greatly welcomed since it was a hot day.
This is the bank you might want to consider if you're tired of the mega banks.
I use mary for all of my personal business, but more importantly refer her to all of my clients.
If you want the best insurance agent, at the best company, call mary
Margaret mims gave us great service.
She was very kind to my father whom is hard of hearing.
Customer service depends on when you go and what location.
I have never been in the fort apache location, i only go through the drive up atm machine.
There is never a line, i get to sit in my car and it takes two minutes, no hassle!
I have everything through these people!
My cars,car insurance,homeowners insurance,personal loan, and credit cards.
Their customer service is by far the best!
Currently even looking into refinancing my house through them as well.
All i do is open the app and i can see all my accounts and pay bills.
Absolutely love this company and it's high standard of customer service!
Thank you to all that serve this great country!
They get a 3 for the branch and a 5 for device and ease.
However, the loan process and ease of it was great.
Opened an account here when received a 150$ offer to open an account in the mail.
I just so happened to be looking for a new bank so gave it a try.
After a little over 3 months i met all the requirements and received the 150$ in my account.
I also like their online banking and app very easy to use and great layout overall.
Sure they could use more locations but joining a smaller bank you know that going in.
And 150$ will go a long way to pay an occasional fee if i need to use another bank atm.
Again awesome online banking setup and bill pay.
I have been with nevada state bank for almost 10 years.
It's an excellent bank to bank with.
In this amount of time i'm sure you understand that i've had a couple skirmishes with them here and there.
Nothing big where i needed to open up a new account somewhere else.
I like that there are a lot of these banks in town so it can be quite convenient.
Other than that, customer service has never been that bad.
Could be better at times, but once again i have nothing to really complain about.
I have been a member for 15 years, and kept our accounts as we moved around.
Service at uwcu is always amazing.
They are always a year or more ahead of others in terms of technology and convenience.
Surely this can't be this hard???
I've had my cc number stolen overseas, and they called me within an hour before i knew anything was awry.
They took care of everything for me, and i never had to call some anonymous call center for help.
I didn't always value this, but i've used some bad online banking.
Oak bank far exceeded my expectations.
Do not go here if you are expecting a typical banking experience.
Even their mobile banking competes with large competitors, which can be a concern with smaller banks.
So are you ready to lay down roots in the madison area?
Do you want to trust your bank, even in this age of certainty?
Oak bank is personable and professional.
By fitchburg, in fitchburg.
We're all in this together, my fellow citizens.
This place is worth checking out.
Chris austad was a true banking professional today!
He was able to help me through a situation where my accounts were compromised by fraudulent activity.
He gave me peace of mind and set me up with new accounts.
He was a pleasure to converse with!
I will make this my new home bank of america!
This bank gives me faith in banking.
I have had terrible experinces with *other* financial institutions.
I am so grateful that in serving one is able to join the usaa family.
I have never had one problem, complaint, nor issue with them at all.
It's like being in a very exclusive club, without the fanfare.
Chase bank is one of those exceptional banking institutions.
But your account is the quarterback- that is their job.
Inside the branches, the representatives are always nice and super patient; thanks- my brain is like dial-up at times.
If that's your style though, the atm still gives large bills.
Chase, i'll continue to bank with you because you guys are awesome, and i love awesome.
Keep up the good work.
Unfortunately  i have to pay their $3.00 fee & my bank's fee for using their atm.
I asked to meet with someone re debt management.
I met with jessie at the junction rd/old sauk branch.
He was extremely professional yet very approachable.
Jessie gave me a number of good suggestions but did not try to "sell" me summit credit union services.
I really liked working with him and trusted his expertise.
Ultimately i did become a member of summit by opening a couple of accounts with them.
I highly recommend summit and jessie to anyone who has questions re debt consolidation or any other financial needs.
Thanks much summit and jessie!
First time chase user and it was a good experience to say the least.
Coming from bank of america most things were very similar.
Neither of these things was offered at chase.
Despite that, chase was a solid option since boa isn't in cleveland.
Its in a great location.
All said and done, i would definitely recommend chase.
They have a ton of good services they're just a step behind boa.
This branch helped out my bro and i big time!
She handled a difficult transaction that branch locations usually don't deal with.
Went above and beyond, and what could've been a bad situation turned out good!
Best bank in town.
Branches all over, staff are friendly and courteous.
Highly recommend their services especially for business accounts.
I have to tell you about one of your employees.
He has a very professional manner, dresses very professional.
Because of him,i will tell others about the great experience i had there.
He greeted me with an sincere smile and kept it on.
So many people just don't go the extra mile, but he did.
Thank you marco wibowo!
After about 6 months with nevada state bank, we couldn't be happier.
Who knew a bank could be this good?
Everyone is knowledgeable, competent, friendly and very helpful.
In particular, kim has been very helpful, especially expertly helping us with an important and complicated wire transaction.
Thank you corie and nora.
This bank is amazing!
The staff work so hard to get things done and quickly.
They are so nice and welcoming when i walk in.
I would highly recommend them!
So nice for hawaii residents to be able to withdraw some cash to replace what went into the slot machines.
Would be nice if i came here to make a big deposit some time instead.
I always have a knowledgeable and friendly representative help me out.
Quite simply the gold standard of banking and insurance in my book.
I had an excellent experience at midfirst bank in fountain hills recently.
At the last minute i needed some documents notarized and i met with sherri c, assistant banking center manager.
She was quick, helpful, kind and thoughtful and saved us a lot of time and stress.
It felt to me like she was the kind of person who put herself in someone else's shoes.
It was a very pleasant experience.
I highly recommend this bank.
This bank was originally recommended to me by a friend 3 years ago who also couldn't say enough about them.
Margaret and corie are amazing these ladies both go above and beyond for their clients.
I have never had this kind of experience with anyone.
Margaret opened my teenage daughters account for her and spent so much time with her.
I am so grateful to have these ladies be apart of our banking experience.
They have far exceeded my expectations and have made us feel like family.
I had the most amazing experience at this bank.
Thank you chase for helping me to help my children.
Christine was awesome and made the process for getting my credit card so easy.
She even followed up with me to let me know about a special program for travel benefits.
Thank you christine for my most amazing experience.
You are a blessing to those you help.
Thank you chase bank!
Our family has been with nevada state for over 20 years.
Chris is very professional, friendly and helpful.
He always makes our personal and business banking experience easy and stress free.
He was friendly and explained everything thoroughly.
He made us feel like we knew each other and were having a conversation with a friend.
Therefore, i'd like to provide my 2 cents.
My experience with this branch had always been positive (other banks just can't provide).
Dont' be wasting valuable resources and be a whinner when you are there asking for help to be spoon feed.
I just moved into town and have never opened a bank account separate from my parents.
I had the most amazing service from jose!!!!
And he introduced me to everyone in the room on first name basis and i felt so welcomed!!!
This actually makes me excited to go to the bank now to deposit checks.
My go to place for all financial matters.
If you are employed by uw you get great discounts, take advantage.
I like the long hours and the staff is always really friendly.
I do appreciate the big drive thru, easy access and enough space to go around.
When i was younger, i had such a hard time with banks!
When i finally signed up for usaa, they actually took the time to educate me about my finances.
Funnily enough, what turned me onto usaa was a car accident.
At the time, i was with another company, and the person who hit me had usaa.
They treated me better, educated me, defended me... which was way more then my company had done for me.
Thanks usaa for being there for me through all of the bumps in the road!
Its what you expect of a military bank.
Friendly employees and no lines.
They helped me get cash and i was on my way rather quickly.
I come here to drop off my rent check.
I never have a very long wait, and the tellers are very helpful.
For this type of transactions this branch seems very good.
I went into the bank today to resolve some charges on my account.
Thank you ladies, i will definitely be back and will refer my friends and family.
The line moves quickly.
The service is polite and friendly.
They went above and beyond.
The chase bank staff is great.
We don't typically write reviews but this branch deserves it.
We recently moved to the scottsdale area and the bankers at this branch have been incredibly helpful since day one.
They've given us information to help us simplify our businesses and helped us with merchant services.
Deposits, wires, opening new accounts etc.
Have all been done quickly and efficiently.
We appreciate this branch a ton and will be back regularly!
Great card good phone service never have a problem.
They do not charge a fee if you go over balance
My go to lending team!!!
As a realtor®, you need a lender you can trust and count on.
Tim george and his team are the ones!
They communicate every step of the way!
If you are looking to purchase or refinance i wouldn't hesitate to give them a call.
I absolutely love one nevada credit union!
They've worked with me financially for years and margaret mims is amazing!
This location is the credit card underwriting office for usaa, not a branch of the main federal savings bank.
Located nearby to the headquarters, this uw credit union is a decent credit union for all your banking needs.
Along with greeter front desk to route where you need to go next.
The line for the tellers are decent and moves relatively quickly.
The restrooms are also very clean and modern.
There's also a cute play table for kids in the corner with small chairs to play while waiting.
Quite adorable with some children books to keep kids occupied.
There's a station for free coffee and water.
I was a bofa gal when i was in ca, but have since become a chase gal in nv.
They first got me with their credit cards, specifically the sapphire and now reserve.
But of all the branches i've been to, this one does have really good customer service.
The banker i spoke to was patient and courteous when i asked my 101 questions.
He even gave me good referrals for insurance and security.
If you need a bank and relationship manager/bankers, go to this location.
They are awessone in there.
Margret mims is the best!
Very helpful and curtiuos to all of their members.
All around great people.
Patient and friendly always looking out for the best interests of clients.
Glad i switched over from my previous agent.
Have had nothing but positive experiences with gary garrett and his office staff.
I have been using this location for years and i have never had any issues.
The staff has always been very friendly and always answers any questions i ever have.
The only drawback to this location is the parking.
The parking spots only hold about 8 cars and during the day it's difficult to find a parking.
I have been going to this bank for about a year now.
Staff is always friendly, i had a charge they reversed, and the managers are great.
They always take care of me when i show up needing a lot of change on short notice.
Of all the chase bank locations i've been to (which includes several states), this location is by far my favorite.
The staff here is friendly, professional and efficient.
I've never had to wait more than a minute, and the staff always processes my transaction quickly.
At other locations i get frequently annoyed at how the staff forces small talk.
They notice my out of state id, etc.
And start chatting me up.
I don't have that problem at this location however.
The staff is kind and makes me feel welcome but they don't waste my time and i really appreciate that.
They have a drive thru, a drive thru atm and an additional atm inside.
If you like chase (which i do), this location is one worth visiting.
I love my bank.
I have a problem one phone call and they got it.
Banking with them is so simple for me.
My go to bank, 15 min walk.
Staffs are helpful and friendly.
Good location for everyone in the area.
Lots of restaurants around the area and family owned stores.
I was tired of paying such a high interest on my car loan i decided to refinance.
He answered all of my questions and made the entire process quick and easy!
They offer great incentives and i walked out with a super low rate.
Staff is very helpful and super friendly
I have to mention...the customers who come here are chatty and slow.
Good location and staff are super friendly.
Downsize is only one atm inside but there is a drive thru atm.
Busy on fridays and long weekends.
Clean stores and financial advisors are super knowledgeable and friendly.
5 stars if staffing levels were better and extra inside atm.
This review is for the us bank not inside the smith's (but shares a parking lot).
4550 address is not the one inside the smith's.
4600 is the address for the one inside the smith's.
Anyway, i've been coming here for well over 4 years now as my main us bank branch.
I've seen many employees come and go.
I not once have ever been met with rudeness or any attitude.
The customer service here is always excellent.
They care about their customers here, and it shows!
Highly recommend if you are a student or in the military.
Adam, hannah and team were so helpful from the start.
We were first-time home buyers and weren't super familiar with the process.
Every time i called bay equity though someone was there to answer the phone and had great customer service.
Just genuinely looking out for us.
We were so lucky to have his knowledge, our rate would have been at least 1% higher without him!
On top of that, we had no fear whatsoever that our loan would close on time.
I appreciated working with them and definitely recommend them as people you can trust!
One nevada and monica martin helped me with a signature loan.
The amount i asked for was not granted due to my earnings.
They had a counter offer and i gladly accepted.
I did not know counter offers even existed.
Monica martin at the bonanza location was a key factor.
She communicated with me quickly and had paperwork signed and sealed in a week and only took 5 min.
Monica should be recognized for her caring about members  and her professionalism.
Thank you to both k.
This wells fargo was one of the last to open under the wachovia nameplate.
Shortly thereafter the conversion was complete.
It's clean and the staff has always been very pleasant.
The center is easy to access and nicely laid out.
The branch manager is knowledgeable, personable and professional.
I handle all of my branch banking needs there and we even rent one of their safe deposit boxes.
I know that you will enjoy doing business with her.
I have been banking with onenevada for over 34 years.
Financial service rep margaret mims is amazing.
Very friendly, helpful and always eager to solve any issues i have.
Would not recommend using onenevada for any real estate or home mortgage needs though.
I give them one star for service here.
Trying to get through to any of the loan officers is impossible!!
They are either not available, busy or on vacation.
I made a comment on their facebook page and a manager had another loan officer call me.
They have been very helpful and happy for my business.
Adam took the time on a weekend to go over all my options of purchasing a new home with me.
I am excited to work with adam and his team and would refer all my family and friends to him.
The boles team has been available to me whenever i needed to ask questions which is very rare these days.
We had a recommendation on this company from a few people.
Our loan went smoothly thanks to ken sarna and his team at jfk.
I have banked with usaa for over seven years.
They are hands down better than any local bank.
They treat us like family.
We apply for all of our loans on our phone and have an approval fairly quickly.
We don't have their insurance, so i cannot vouch for that, but all other services are great.
I believe this location is just a satellite office that offers very little service.
But why even go there?
I take photos of my personal checks and deposit via mobile.
Absolutely the friendliest staff and great service i love aloha pacific great cd special!
Megan and the management have always helped with whatever i've needed.
This is the best branch ever!
Aubrey has the best customer service!
She is a teller at the bank and always takes care of all my account needs!
Joe is the loan officer!
He was amazing to work with answered all mine and my husbands questions and was very easy to work with!
Tiffany runs this branch very well!
The people were super on the ball and i was shocked when i read the reviews.
I worked with rachel, head of business development, this young lady was so professional and easy to work with.
This event was to get to know their customers.
Once a customer came in they were greeted with a smile and these employees were working past 5 and smiling.
The business is clean, attractive and inviting.
Please give them another opportunity.
Carmen martinez the branch managerwas so understanding.
Amazing cs she cashed my check.
Now i can pay my bills on time.
Amazing service every time!
Everyone is always smiling and asking if you need anything.
Absolutely wonderful customer service!
This branch is one of the only two in las vegas that can give you a checkcard on the spot.
I zipped over during my lunch break.
The banker was super sympathetic and helped me get a card right then and there.
Helped ease my stress a ton.
I have been going to this branch for about 2.5 years.
I have always had friendly service.
They have been accommodating even for some of my oddball requests.
The manager has also been helpful and i have seen her jump to help me whenever she was able.
Been with one nevada for 4 years now.
I really enjoy banking here.
So far, so good.
I'm opening a new account.
Everyone has been super friendly and helpful.
More so than my other bank who shall remain nameless.
*cough...wells fargo*  i was helped by lisa, a trainee, and margaret her trainer.
Lisa didn't stumble with her words while helping me.
No waiting 5-7 business days for "the real" card.
Annnnd...i was given treats while i waited...and it wasn't those nasty suckers that other banks give out.
I think this may be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
Review for merchant services....
I come in to make deposits for the company from time to time.
The staff here is friendly and professional !!
They move quickly and treat you like you and your time are important!!
Thank you for this !!!!
Love mary and her team!
They are always so helpful and willing to go the extra mile!
Everyone is so friendly and helpful!
She's professional, timely and and always responds to me in a timely manner.
Casey is definitely on top of it!
The whole loan process could not have gone any smoother.
She is very upfront and honest with all fees and timelines.
Everything was nothing short of spectacular.
Thanks so much casey!
Most of the time there are no lines.
Office is nice & clean.
Staff are always helpful & friendly.
Associate justin is awesome!
And amazing and great!
It was an easy and, dare i say, fun experience.
Thank you, margaret, for making it an easy process.
From the get-go the customer service was excellent.
We were greeted as soon as we walked in the bank, offered water and made quite comfortable.
Three separate bankers approached us to ensure we were being taken care of.
We opened an account and found the process to be quite easy, and for banking, surprisingly painless.
We have additional meetings set up to discuss some issues like refinancing our mortgage or perhaps even new vehicle.
This experience was excellent, and mirrors all the previous experiences i had when they were servicing a different account.
I am very glad we made the decision to move our money to wells fargo.
They were friendly to my pup and engaged in pleasant conversation.
Love this bank and all the people whom work here!
Andrew h is exceptional.
Every time i returned to this branch, he would remember my name and it ask about my day.
You do not find customer service like that in 2018.
If all bmo harris bank employees and policies were as customer centric, i would likely still be a customer.
I just bought a house in the madison area (relocating from colorado).
My realtor recommended oak bank for my mortgage, and i'm so glad he did.
They were extremely fast with their decisions and made sure everything went smoothly.
Carrie montgomery was so friendly and helpful.
She answered all my questions and returned phone calls right away.
My email account cut out on me the day of the close.
I was freaking out i was going to miss something important.
Carrie made sure everything went off without a hitch.
I will definitely use oak bank again.
My wife and i just recently switched our banking services to us bank.
The process of opening our new account was quick and easy.
We had the pleasure of working with tiffany and leah today.
They were both super nice!
This location will be our main branch and we look forward to doing business with you guys.
I came to nevada state bank after the customer service at my former back went south.
I have had nothing but great experiences with this bank.
Their loan department is great and very easy to work with.
I have had no issues with my accounts with this bank.
This us bank location is inside the smith's grocery.
We first started coming here just every now and then to hit up the atm after grocery shopping.
We had lukewarm service at the stand-alone branch and prefer to go into the store branch.
The ladies that work there are very friendly and professional.
We have never had any issues with customer service or accounts.
I recently had my wallet stolen and had to change everything over.
First thing i did was call this branch to take care of my needs.
Kristen is the one who answered my call and took care of all of my acocunts.
I then had to go to the bank to sign some paperwork, which she did not delay on at all.
This branch is definitely our location of choice whenever we need something more than an atm can offer.
I have had all my insurance with mary contreras for the past 20 years.
Mary knows her stuff and knows how to direct you and keep you safe while address all your needs.
Recently someone backed into me in a parking lot and it was a saturday.
If you are thinking of getting insurance, look nowhere else but mary contreras.
Herself and her staff are top notch!!
Good service  i've been a member of the credit union for a very long time.
So far, it's been going very well.
I have a checking, savings, and ira account so i go to the credit union fairly often.
The staff are always helpful and friendly.
The facilities are quite nice.
Overall, i would recommend this credit union, over big banks.
I feel like the people here really have my best interest in mind.
I've never had any problems.
I don't normally write reviews, but recently i was at oncu and was really impressed with the customer service.
I was helped by marco wibowo.
I was looking for auto loan information and he jumped to help me and answered all my questions.
I walked away knowing more than when i walked in.
I'll be back for sure.
The interest rates were good, but the customer service was stellar.
Best mortgage lender i have ever dealt with!
Tim and his team were so helpful, answered all of my questions and were very professional.
Went in yesterday for an appointment with tony g. we opened an account for my son.
The young man who greeted us was very welcoming and kind.
Tony was also very kind and was helpful the whole appointment.
Normally not very impressed with this location but yesterday they definitely changed my opinion about this location!
Kylee and shelly were very professional, helpful, courteous and friendly.
I felt very comfortable and they made me feel okay.
They patiently explained to me everything that went on with my auto loan and gave me everything that i needed.
I would recommend kylee for anyone who needs an auto loan.
Thank you kylee and shelly.
As i am fairly new to the city of pittsburgh coming from ny i needed a local bank account.
I decided on pnc as they have both personal and business accounts and there are no fees.
I said i was interested in opening an account and they said it would just be a few minutes.
The staff where super friendly and very helpful.
I am glad i choose this bank.
I've never experienced the drive through banking at this location but i never really see people waiting.
This is for the bank in the parking lot --not the smith's.
I have been a customer for 7 years and always found the employees to be extra friendly and efficient .
My favorite employee is deondre templeton -- he  always helps me in special ways .
Always helpful, always professional!
Even though i have moved from mcfarland i continue to use their services.
We have had our business insurance with don for years.
The price is great and the service we recieve is fantastic.
Excellent service provided by marlene.
She has always provided friendly, helpful advice and assistance.
I strongly recommend dealing with this state farm insurance office.
Margaret gave the best service i have received in a credit union for as long as i can remember.
She was nice, courteous, and got me in and out the door.
I would recommend going to see her or any of the other members at the credit union.
Best insurance company in pittsburgh.
I have been working with chad and his office staff for 3 years and they are excellent.
I highly recommend them.
The bank itself is a five star for great service, but the parking...ugh...
It's in a very busy strip mall and parking is usually full.
Expect to hunt for a space and probably park far away.
Staff is very nice, and friendly.
Went in to open an account, and it was so fast and easy, i actually had a blast.
A nice change of pace compared to some other banks.
Hours on yelp & website has been updated.
After a year of banking at this location i found the tellers to be very accommodating and courteous.
We use them for business banking and they have been wonderful to work with.
Kyle miller my car loan officer was a great help in getting my financing completed.
Very nice,  offered help over and above to make as smooth as possible
They welcomed me with open arms and the customer service is great!
Always make sure to make an appointment!
The staff are always friendly and helpful, it is never that crowded.
Kyle is so incredibly nice and helpful!
Its really nice to walk into a large business and be remembered!
Highly recommend banking with 1 nevada!
This place is awesome.
I came in today, to get my vehicle refinance.
They offered me a great deal, i couldn't refuse.
The personal there, are friendly & feels homebody to me...
Especially, the rep. margaret... got some laughs & explained the process very well to me...
I definitely recommend, if your looking for a local bank, that makes you feel at home.
Looking forward to my future endeavours with them.
We recently closed a home refinance with adam and his team.
The entire process went very smoothly and communication was proactive.
This is our second loan closed with bay equity and we will use them again in the future.
Highly recommend this firm!
Clayton is the best business banker!
Never a wait and very helpful.
I literally drive 15 min out of the way to come to this branch.
This banker kenneth is gold!
Thank you for making my name change so smooth and an enjoyable process!
I would highly recommend gregorini state farm to anyone looking for insurance.
Unfortunately i don't live in pa anymore or i would still have my insurance with him.
The boles team from bay equity is simply the best.
I have bought and sold several homes and i would never use any one else for a purchase loan again.
The process from beginning to end was seamless, professional, and just an over all great experience.
I would refer them to all!!
I do banking and insurance through usaa and i love their customer service.
If i could give more stars, i would!
If your tired of being treated as an account number at your bank, you'll love arizona federal credit union.
The employees are friendly and helpful, and the president is responsive.
This was one of the best experiences we had with a loan officer.
Needless to say, we highly recommend casey moseman!
They do have great customer service, they take care my money well, and i enjoy doing business with them.
One of the best branches i have been to.
I have been banking with one nevada credit union for 7 years.
Kyle at the summerlin branch is by far one of the most customer service oriented workers i have met.
He's assisted me on 2 separate occasions.
Very knowledgeable and always has a pleasant demeanor!!
I will be making this my go to branch ;-)
I have my auto loan with them and i have 3 other accounts with them.
The customer service at this location is top notch.
Bankers and managers are very knowledgeable.
They know what they're doing and they explain everything no hidden fees...
I recommend everyone to go to lvac location for your financial needs.
I could not have asked for a better lo and processor in doug turner and jaclyn niehaus with great western.
They made the entire process of buying my first 'big home' a walk in the park!!
You can not go wrong using great western.
Thanks you guys made for the best holidays!
I sent her my documents thru the shoot.
She partially completed my slip then sent it back to me to sign and finish.
On a friday, during rush hour, this is highly unheard of.
I would definitely use this drive up teller if i'm ever in this area again.
She is truly passionate about helping her clients!
Mary is a genuinely caring person and goes above and beyond the call of duty for her clients.
I consider her a friend as well as my insurance agent.
I have now had my car and home insurance with mary for years and continue to value her expertise.
Most recently, mary went out of her way to help me resolve an issue i had with my hoa.
The issue was ultimately resolved successfully.
We recommend her highly for her expert knowledge, immediate assistance, and care that she demonstrated for us.
Money saved, lessons learned, and amazing results with my policies.
When i first walked into this cozy office, i felt relaxed and unintimidated.
State farm saved me so much money in comparison.
The education and detail i recieved from my extremely proffesional non-intimidating knowledgable agent was an awakening.
Jason mallon took the time to explain things to me , and not in a condescending manner.
Jason is the man to see.
He makes you feel relaxed and secure.
The outcome of my visit was satisfaction, dollarwise and trustwise.
I left with such a feeling of accomplishment and a security in my choice.
Thanks to jason and the jack mussey agency.
Now i can breath with easier lower payments for more coverage.
Check it out and see what they can do for you.
Could not ask for better & easier loan!
In addition, nicole rocks!!
It's a pleasure to watch that girl juggle!
Great experience dealing with al lizarralde and michele townsend.
Al and michele were both clear, they explained what documents they needed and why they needed them.
They returned every single phone call and email.
I truly felt like this company had our best interests in mind throughout the process.
Thank you once again for the awesome customer service, that is rare.
I was so angry, stomping mad when i made my way into this building today.
We have just transferred our state farm insurance from texas to arizona.
Hope at this location was a rockstar!!
She went  through our plan with us and helped us make the right decision about our insurance!
Fantastic working with this agent and his team!!
Thanks so much hope!
Well another good experience at the first bank i ever enjoyed going to.
Thanks scott husband you an amazing dude!!!!!
And thanks wells fargo for hiring people like scott husband.
I recently refinanced my auto loan with one nevada credit union.
I would like to commend margaret mims for her outstanding customer service.
I have been with another bank since beginning college 9.5 years ago.
I finally decided i needed to switch.
There were a few reasons i was drawn to pnc.
1) you can take dollar amounts out of their atm.
2) 3 bank accounts linked together-- spend (checking), reserve (savings) & growth (long term savings) .
No need to open 3 separate accounts  3) checking and savings have unlimited transfer.. something my current bank doesn't offer.
6 transfers then they charge you $10 to transfer your own money.. ugh.
Im excited to take advantages of all of the perks.
Was recommended bmo by a good friend and decided, why not?
It's seriously the best banking i have ever had!
He calls just to check in and i honestly don't know why i hadn't used bmo before.
I'll be staying for good.
Customer service at this branch is top-notch.
Welcoming, helpful, and invested.
Ricardo brown is the branch manager and he's an excellent banker.
Wouldn't want to sit down with anybody else for my banking needs.
Or really anybody at this branch.
I'd go a little out of my way just to do business at this branch.
Excellent experience every time.
Full disclosure:   this is not my personal bank, but i go often with family members who bank there.
The bank is clean, parking is plentiful and the lines move very quickly.
The tellers are friendly and efficient, and effort is put into a pleasant customer experience.
There are lollipops/suckers for kids of all ages at each of the teller windows, and the bathrooms are clean.
As a guest the few transactions i have conducted here have been 100 % positive.
I love this bank.
Super friendly, especially joshua.
They are very efficient and know the banking products.
I go here for business and have never been disappointed.
My recent experience with this branch was amazing.
Darlene was the nicest, most thoughtful and professional person i've encountered in a long time.
Darlene was so understanding and patient with us and went above and beyond normal customer service.
She was so sweet and caring and made this difficult situation much easier.
Thank you so much.
For a hands on banking experience, i recommend this branch.
Darlene and erica and the rest of the staff will take great care of you.
I came in because someone suggested i try them for banking.
I looked up their yelp reviews and i am extremely glad i went to see them today.
He was kind and efficient with a great big smile.
I'm so glad i decided to bank with them.
I give 2 thumbs up to kyle.
Nextier bank is by far one of the best banks around.
I have even started the process in moving my personal accounts to nextier.
I have been with usaa since 2001 and i love them.
I have never had s bad experience with them.
They have always been great service and i love the app as well!
Wouldn't change banks i have had bad experiences with other banks!
I opened a savings account with dsfcu years ago and have to say, i really like this bank.
The branch staff are always friendly and process my deposits and payments quickly.
I eventually opened a credit card account with 0% financing to pay off some debt.
No issues with that, worked like a charm.
When alliant, another credit union that took on my car loan, completely failed me, i simply switched to dsfcu.
Ever since then i've had zero problems with car payments.
I've gone to the branch on 44th st and also had a positive experience.
I understand others have had negative experiences, and i sympathize.
However, based on my experiences, i recommend this bank and branch.
Thank you, you awesome bank of america atm.
Although you don't talk much, you provide extremely fast and efficient service.
I like that i don't get charged a fee to use you.
The fastest branch in town.
I was in and out in less than 2 minutes.
Clients like me appreciate good customer service.
I found myself at the afcu on s. 48th.
Walking through the doors i was immediately greeted by two employees offering assistance.
Once i explained my situation, they graciously helped me with my transaction.
I was in & out with my cash without any issues.
I will (& have) recommended afcu to the family & friends we have in arizona.
Opened a checking and savings at this location the other day.
The staff was very friendly and helpful.
I even got $100 in free groceries from smiths.
It has to be done all on the same day.
Overall i had a great experience!
Mark lidel is a great.
He is able to get loans closed within 30 days or less.
He is dependable and really knowledgeable.
I joined usaa when i was a woc (warrant officer candidate) in 1967.
The cadre suggested that we consider usaa for our auto insurance, and boy, am i glad i listened.
I'm closing in on a "half century" relationship with them, and i cannot imagine doing business with a better company.
I realize that "...you can't make everyone happy all of the time.
I am not a big-bank fan.
The reason i love desert schools is that they are incredibly courteous, friendly, and helpful.
They are great about answering questions and sent i really care about the customer experience.
If you want a good bank where you will actually enjoy the experience, this is where you want to be!
Always on top of the ball with their customer service except one.
He talks more than he works.
I'm like please work and talk.
Multi tasking is key!!
They are very pleasant and quick and dont solicit a ton of services like retail banks.
They always have 3-4 tellers and i have never had a negative experience with anyone.
The parking lot is busy so be careful and the customers arr lollagaggers
I was where's from out of town ..lines were pretty busy but customer service is great.
Jennifer was the one who help me and i was very pleased definitely a five star
I opened up an account here for my wife today.
It was a pleasant experience.
The banker had a great sense of humor and it was simple and straightforward.
I left off 1 star because of the fees for those that have low balances.
It is almost like a poor tax.
I've been a member of this bank for about 5 years.
This is my favorite branch and i come here often.
I get treated with respect.. the atm occasionally doesn't work.
That's my one complaint.
Uw credit union is the best.
If you just need to do a fast transaction, the line moves very quickly and costumer service is a excellent.
I received usaa insurance through my dad who was in the air force.
I have nothing but good things to say about usaa.
The yearly dividends, great customer service, the best rates.
Several years ago someone got a hold of my cc and was charging a monthly fee to a website.
It took me a couple of months to notice it but when i did usaa was all over it.
Their fraud department is the best.
I've had mortgages with them, checking, savings and cc.
I deposit all my checks on my phone directly to my usaa account.
My paycheck is directly deposited to my usaa checking account.
Even if i could find a cheaper car insurance i wouldn't switch; usaa is to good to give up.
Uwcu is a phenomenal financial institution.
In all my dealings they have always been straight-forward and honest.
We have worked with matt deadman in the past and have been continually impressed.
Have you ever wondered how wfb can survive?
Service - the teller was great.
He was wearing a sweater so i could not get his name.
He was helpful, easy going, professional and gave me some advice about accounts for my teens that was actually helpful.
Then he introduced me to their manager and that was cool to.
First class in my book.
Location - right on eastern and st. rose parkway.
Easy in and out, outdoor tellers and also two outside atm and inside as well.
C.  atm - if you take over 100 from the atm, you might get some 50's with it.
If you go to the atm inside the bank, you generally get 20's only.
Overall, i liked the service and the friendliness.
I was on verge of leaving wfb for the exact reasons i like this one.
I felt anonymous, and indifferent.
Today, the experience here was great.
However i don't really understand how to bank here.
Not to sound old but i don't get their new machines.
I always have to wait for staff to help me.
Usually not a long wait.
The atm is usually pretty busy.
Great bank, super friendly staff and, well, there's always candy lol.
This branch is awesome!
Several time they have helped me when there was fraud activity on my account.
I took he advice and it worked.
I really appreciate the service at this branch.
I highly recommend this chase location.
I recently got married and wanted to combine my insurance with my wife's.
Mr. swanson took his time (2hours!)
With us, explaining in depth everything we had questions about.
I have been with uw credit union for a very long time.
I have had some minor trouble with them in the past, but they have always been very helpful.
Their staff are willing to go above and beyond for their members.
Can't say enough good things about mary.
I've been to this huntington bank location, oh, about 4 times since moving to the area in february.
Guess i could say i've adopted this huntington as "my" huntington.
This location is nice, inside and out.
Not your typical plain old ho-hum-looking bank building.
The location, in mcintyre square just off mcknight road, is convenient.
There's no denying the convenience of north hills.
So far, this huntington is no exception.
Now, they insure our cars, home, and our lives, literally.
Kent baker's office is a pleasure to work with.
The staff are so friendly and caring.
Whenever i call, they're happy to take the time to answer all my questions and explain everything clearly.
We're lifers with state farm, and we love this local office!
Thanks for all you do for us!
My husband has been with them since 1996, i've been with them since 2006!
Brianna has the best customer service that i've had in a while.
The reason i love this company so much!
Never really had any problems here.
Friendly employees and the complimentary water is always flowing.
We have been using state farm, cie taylor agency for the past six months.
Our agent torrie tyler has been exceptional in servicing both our auto, and renters policies.
I would highly recommend this agency to all of my friends and family.
Once they meet you, you're like family from then on.
I also love the new location!
They have an atm that i use whenever i need to whenever i am out this way.
I'm very appreciative of the staff here, especially justin.
All the staff members are so friendly, full of aloha (no pun intended).
He is very knowledgeable, informative, professional, efficient...
Pretty much all of the above.
The establishment pretty much never has a line, so clean, and feels like home.
You're always greeted with a smile, and you always feel warm and welcomed.
Great service, always knowledgeable and courteous.
I have been customer at this branch for many years and every experience was top quality.
I've baked with boa, chase, and american savings in the past.
Usaa blew all of them away, as far as service.
They remind me that they value my business and they are so personable when assisting.
Anytime i need something done, such as, fax, email, online assistance, they are prompt.
I always have a resolution to my problem at the end of a call.
When dealing with my investments, i get off the call more knowledgeable and empowered.
I have confidence leaving my money in their bank.
I'm in it till the end!
Melany was super patient, genuine, and wasn't pushing sales solutions.
My time with her was smooth and she covered all details, notably my favorite banker interaction.
I worked with matt on a heloc.
He made the entire process seamless and very efficient from start to finish - not to mention timely!
We were able to close quickly.
I highly recommend him.
Or at least it's what i've experienced.
Thank you, margaret, and thank you, oncu.
Mary and her team handle all of my insurance needs from the car, home and professional.
Mary takes a personalized approach to fit my needs.
When my son was in a minor fender bender, i felt like i was calling family.
Thank you, mary and team!
I will be making the switch very soon!
I've been with this office for years and i'm always satisfied with their service.
Would definitely recommend this agency!
I don't have generally good stories about banks...but then again, who does?
I have to say that my entire experience with one nevada has been nothing but stellar!
Suzie has been a charm to work with and the entire staff was very friendly when i came in.
With mega-banks you are less of a customer and more of a number.
She even walked me to the atm to show me how my account and card would work.
For a tech-savvy person this touch showed that she really cared about the whole process.
Thank you one nevada and thank your awesome employee suzie.
Everyone was very nice and professional.
I didn't wait at all.
The greeter/administrator in the front took care of my needs right away.
We have our main credit card here b/c my dear fil served in the air force.
I'm grandfathered in for marrying his offspring - the benefit ends here, i think.
They work with you on life insurance, auto loans, home loans, all things financial.
This is probably one of the friendliest banks i've been in.
The staff is so courteous.
They greet you at the door both coming and going.
The manager even opened the door for me once on the way out.
The tellers have manners too.
It must be part of some kind of incentive program or something.
I had to conduct some business at chase bank.
We were greeted by the manager and the teller was efficient and friendly.
I will make this my branch.
I like that they are locally owned.
The offer a high level of customer service.
Their rates (loans and deposits) are competitive.
Again, their customer service is top notch.
Everyone is extremely helpful and friendly.
You get the impression they really appreciate your business.
I am currently in the process of refinancing my house.
The process has been painless, efficient, and i am extremely pleased with the interest rate.
Added bonus - fresh baked cookies in the lobby every day!
My experience with this company was wonderful.
We went in to see about laptops and came out with a great laptop.
The price was just right.
I highly recommend this company to do business with.
Tell them elias sent you.
I have never received better customer service from a bank than what i have received from monona state bank.
Every time i enter the branch, i am greetly warmly and welcomed as a member.
The tellers are genuinely happy to help me with any transaction.
I can see where the rest of the staff gets their passionate customer serivce from.
I feel like i am a valued member at my local bank.
It's the way all banks should be.
It's the kind of banking that makes a customer say wow.
Not very re-assuring when you've sent all your confidential docs to a company.
This is my first time using this branch location.
Upon entering the bank we were immediately greeted and seated with bottle water.
The asst branch manager was very professional, nice and handled the transaction efficiently.
I will definitely be returning.
After speaking with someone, there was 1 unauthorized charge and they (chase) canceled my current debit card.
As soon as i walked in, i was greeted by one of the agents in a cubicle.
I explained the situation and she advised me that she was able to assist me.
I had to provide 2 forms of id and give her my old debit card, which she voided.
The whole process took about 10 minutes and i was out of there with a brand new card.
Just started banking with one nevada.
The customer service is amazing.
The tellers are so friendly.
I've never had a problem with anyone.
The teller that opened my account is named shelly.
She literally turned my day around by being friendly.
I have conducted business transactions inside and out over the last few months.
Everyone has been courteous, knowledgeable and friendly each time.
I love my 1nv credit union!
Kyle is our guy and is always very pleasant & ready to assist with all of our needs.
Couldn't ask for better service.
Especially in today's society, where good service seems to be on the decline.
The whole staff here is super friendly & always up beat.
So happy we bank with them!
This is probably one of the best wells fargo banks in arizona!
The guy that took care of us, marcus, was very nice and friendly!
I would recommend banking with these guys!
I can't really tell between an average bank and an extremely good bank.
But i can tell between an average bank and a really crappy one.
I'd say this chase is pretty average - good.
This was one of the worse banking experiences i have ever had .
From my experience with him isaac he could use more customer service training.
I've been to this location at least 40 times.
I have my mortgage with them.
Every time you walked in you are greeted by a smiling face.
The colors are extremely friendly.
I haven't had a breath of an issue with anyone or this businesses practices.
I've got no complaints!
They do everything the bank is supposed to do.
Bank of america has been giving me problems with my account...
So since i have my mortgage with wells fargo, i was thinking about switching to them anyway.
Carmen i want to say thank you.
Your staff and you have made our day and helped us a lot.
You showed us you cared and you helped.
Thank you and i highly suggest to go with wells fargo and this location.
Angie was very friendly and helpful.
She was able to answer all of my questions with no fuss and took time to explain everything to me.
The staff is always friendly and ready to deal.
If  your buying or selling you will leave with a smile.
The wide variety of items they sell, keeps me coming back for more.
If you go, ask for travis.
He is a good guy to deal with.
But, there are other sales people there, that can help you.
They always have plenty help their.
I came in to resolve some of my issues of my bank account and i got the best service ever.
The banker who helped me the name was victor .
The guys was very helpful and resolved all the issues.
Another manager mike and david help d with all the setup.
Great guys and great customers.
He helped us back in 2012 when we were in the market to purchase our first house.
Early this year, he contacted us with some information about the benefits of refinancing.
Although at first we were not interested, he was always available to answer my questions.
Kyle miller, who helped me out was knowledgable and understanding of the situation i was in.
Very friendly and more importantly quick & efficient.
I spent a total of 10 minutes inside and had all my questions answered with a brand new card.
I'm a satisfied costumer and would recommend this bank to anyone!
This location is always so quick and easy.
So it was no question when i had an issue with being overcharged for something i went into this branch.
I was happy to only wait a few minutes when i was greeted by brandon.
I have to say he was so friendly and helpful.
Before i knew it i was out of there and everything was fixed.
This bank is great.
They are very friendly and i have my business accounts here.
I have been working with them for over 2 years now and have had nothing but a great experience.
Much better than bank of america, my last bank.
Good fast friendly staff.
Place was very very clean, must be new.
Margaret and corie are the best.
Thank you so much for all the help.
This is part one there is a part two
I have decided to branch out my reviews to non-restaurants... so here goes!
This boa branch is always clean and the service is always friendly and quick.
And i have never waited in a long line like at other banks (or boa branches).
Gary has to be one of the nicest insurance agents i have ever met.
Not only does he have 20+ years of experience, but he truly cares for his clients.
I highly recommend anyone looking for any sort of insurance to give this man a call.
You'll be glad you did!
Very  friendly staff, first time at this branch.
April helped me out.
Great job and wow...
Need more bankers that look like you:)
We have traditionally had really great service from this branch.
We don't visit a branch often but find the team here friendly and efficient.
The branch is always clean and there are lollipops at the teller stations which the kids certainly appreciate.
Today's visit was a quick one to the teller line where we were immediately greeted.
There was no line on a friday afternoon - hallelujah!
We were in and out in a jiffy!
Love when that happens!
I lost my discover card (in my house) some time ago and still haven't found it.
I was so pleasantly surprised.
The entire process took no more than five minutes (maybe less) on the phone!
He checked to make sure there was no suspicious activity on my account, which there wasn't.
Then offered to send me a new card by fedex free to be delivered in 1-2 days.
It was honestly the easiest customer service experience i've ever had!
Devon, thank you for restoring my faith in customer service!
I've been with chase for awhile for both personal and business and i do love them.
The features they offer their customers are great.
The only issue i have with this location is that the parking lot is awful and oddly laid out.
I almost got a flat trying to figure it out last time.
Spoke with augustine regarding second party deposits and he was very informatively helpful!
I have never felt so welcomed and been treated so kindly in a bank before...
The manager, i believe his name was javier, was so exceptionally helpful and courteous.
Alberto was extremely diligent and polite.
All of the employees were smiling and looked like they truly enjoyed being at work.
This review is for 2311 w. charleston ave. las vegas location.
Very professional employee greets you in line with a clip board and asks what your needs are.
I was there to make a withdrawal.
He filled out the slip and i stood in line about 5 minutes before reaching the only teller.
However,  at least i was prepared to make the quick transaction and be on my way.
Very well dressed,  and super clean interior of the bank.
Way to go chase employees!
(i live in another state,  so thank god chase was on it's toes that day!)
This bank is the best one i've been too ever!
The customer service is spectacular!
The bankers are so friendly and will help you with whatever you need!
I recommend christian if you need help with banking or anything that comes to mind!
I've known dondrell for 10 yrs.
Hes a man of integrity.
I recently financed my vehicle with his office.
She put the deal together quickly and efficiently.
Nora poblador helped me with several changes to my accounts today.
This is my go to one nevada credit union location.
I opened an account over a year ago, and i have nothing but great things to say about the bank.
I would like to start off by saying, that the personnel is always friendly and extremely helpful.
Always providing great insight and mentioning all the different things that we as account holders, one nevada has to offer.
They truly take the time to go over every single one of your questions and concerns.
Like i mentioned before, i made the switch over a year ago, and couldn't be any happier.
I absolutely love one nevada credit union!
They've worked with me financially for years and margaret mims is amazing!
I dealt with margaret mims who was extremely helpful.
I have been treated amazing by one nevada since i first opened my account.
A star employee for sure.
Came in to open an checking and savings account and maggie was absolutely amazing!
The process for everything was smooth and i was in and out.
Thank you again maggie!
Love the fact there's a bank inside the gym.
You can do all your banking needs before or after your workout.
This is a full service branch.
If you need a car loan to even a home mortgage, they can help you with it.
Staff is always friendly.
Be sure to score them "5" if you get a survey.
Free checking accounts for military & students.
I have banked with this credit for some 30 years;  in those years i have had few complaints.
I find their customer service is excellent.
I was not happy with the process for online access when adopted but have learned to work with it.
Just the way the big banks like it!
Now the issue is to fund that account while incurring the least amount of transaction fees.
Luckily, wf personal bankers have no such limitations (at least my bank account is not that big, yet).
Anyway, i was probably at the branch for at least 40 minutes or maybe a hour.
Needless to say, the customer encounter experience i received today at this wf branch is top notch.
If wells fargo employs more employees like salma, their rating would go way up on every measurable metric.
Give her an award, a promotion and a raise!
She definitely deserves it.
My parents set up a savings account for me here when i was little.
And i'm so glad they did!
I have always gotten excellent customer service.
I now have saving and checking accounts as well as vehicle and home loans.
5 star rating for my man,  jared lindsey!
I always come back because i  appreciate his high calibre of service and is always on point!
Thanks you for always being incredible.
Also, they do currency exchanges without any hassle or runaround, which again, is something that is rare in modern banking.
I will definitely return when i am on this side of town and need to get some cash o la.
I've dealt with many banking institutions but none come close to the customer service of this branch and organization.
Setting up accounts (6 of them) is quick!
Every person i've encountered remembers my personal situations and always inquire about the status of my journey.
Feels like a great group of friends when i go to the bank.
In fact, my kids like to go to the bank because of the people (and lollipops!)
Most importantly, their ability to turn the impossible into possible.
Even though it requires out of the box thinking and strategies, they'll get it done.
He is second to none!!
He has an awesome side-kick too!
I love this branch.
Both bankers and tellers are very knowledgeable and always ready to help.
The only minus i would give to this branch is their atms (the new kind) that always get stuck!!!
But obviously that's not bankers fault so i didn't wanted to take the star out because they deserve 6!
(i was sure i'd have to wait 7-10 days to get a new card.)
I am a very satisfied accountholder and plan to stay with this credit union for a long time to come.
I've been a one nevada member since 2000 and will never leave them!
The location i frequent the most is the one on lake mead near buffalo.
The staff there is so friendly and professional.
I love this location out of all of the u.s. bank locations that i have frequented.
I'm always greeted by friendly bankers.
No matter what time of day i come here the wait is never very long.
I like free standing us bank locations over the in-store locations.
I use my chase~ ink card & my cahse ;)freedom)".
Although its an older location but the branch is quite wide and spacious.
The customer service guy was great and friendly.
Service was quite fast and the line were kept short and sweet.
They also have a nice christmas tree setup.
All in all its another branch from bmo but with good great service!
I can not say enough about how wonderful this branch is.
My house burned down 8 days before christmas.
When my insurance sent me a check.
I needed to be able to cash it without a hold being put on it.
That manager did not have to do that for me.
He has been so wonderful through this whole process.
I will always bank with chase and it will always be at this branch.
I've only ever had two problems with them and that's in a 7 year time span.
But this bank is the best.
But don't take my word for it.
Go find out for your selves i can guarantee u will love it :)
Usaa is consistently rated a top employer in phx, as well as the nation.
I have been a uwcu member for 3 years now.
Let me say, becoming a member here has been a revelation to me in banking.
Prepare to be wowed at uwcu.
You will actually feel like your opinions and finances matter.
All of their policies and procedures are fair and even helpful.
Say goodbye to feeling like you are getting screwed over.
Say hello to feeling heard and appreciated.
Great services, great customer service.
That's what uwcu offers!
Really above and beyond what even other credit unions in town offer.
This place is awesome!
My fifth third of choice, quick and the personal banker is extremely helpful every time .
Managers name is joseph franklin.
He will go above and beyond for his customers.
Will bank with them for years to come
Great service and great clients!
We are proud to serve you gilbert!
Come see us and let us prove the client is always number 1
I was visiting my parents in arizona over christmas and received a few checks i wanted to deposit.
I came here probably 2-3 times in a two week period to deposit checks.
The tellers were always very friendly (i used the same one twice) and knew exactly how to do the transaction.
My only issue was one time i came there was a huge line to see a teller.
The line was out of their line-up area thing and it took probably 20 minutes of waiting.
Had a great experience opening a new account with us bank.
The teller walked me through the products and services they offer.
This location is located in the smiths grocery store on green valley parkway.
He spent more time than he probably expected to but was pleasant the entire time.
I opened an account with desert schools credit union years ago.
I never did much with them since i have accounts at another bank as well.
I decided to start looking at options for an auto loan and figured i'd revisit ds.
I am so glad i did!!
I was welcomed by a friendly employee as i entered the camelback branch.
After no wait at all, one of their loan specialists (jeremy) introduced himself and showed me to his desk.
Jeremy was extremely professional, knowledgeable and made the entire process not only a breeze but very delightful!
I truly felt like a person and not just a number.
Except the many many fees for this and that.
Service: their service here is great.
I'm a regular here and i really appreciate how they remember my name.
They're really nice and they also offer more accounts and etc to up sale.
The drive through atm is kind of hard to get into when your coming in from the street.
Be careful in this parking lot people drive like nuts!
I have my ira, my homeowners insurance, my car insurance, and a credit card with usaa.
I couldn't be more pleased.
They offer excellent investment advice, and i recently had water damage in my kitchen due to a leak.
It turned into a mold issue.
And they were right.
Andy and joshua are very helpful and the spend time to address all needs
Exceptional customer service provided by knowledgeable staff.
I appreciate that he has "my back".
I've been a client of andrea's for over a decade and i've never even considered changing agents or insurance companies.
She's always professional, personable, and is quick to assist me anytime i need anything.
(that includes answering any stupid questions i throw at her.)
Andrea never makes me feel like a client.
You'd be hard-pressed to find a better insurance agent to take care of you.
Definitely go here to open an account
I think this location is suuuuuuper cool.
Ask me why..  why lena?
Lena: because the drive thru atm lets you pull out $10!!!
Yanno.. sometimes i dont want $60 cuz i dont need that much.. and sometimes $40 is just not quite enough.
So i'll pull $50!
Its even an option on the fast cash screen so you'll get that spiffy $10 even faster!..
Boy.. i've never seen this before.
Am i way too amused by this?
(my friend told me to do this).
They didnt do that..wells fargo does!
I didnt say that out loud cuz the answer i would get is 'we're not wells fargo'.
But i like bofa cuz they are everywhere.
Overdraft and the fees are outrageous!
Or just stick my lower lip out and hope someone feels bad.
I was referred to lori smolke at great western through lendingtree.
I got a really great deal, and perhaps better than that my experience working with lori went incredibly smoothly.
Of course i needed to come up with an arm and a leg, pdf it, sign it, fax it, etc.
But that is required of all institutions.
It was hectic and uncalled for.
My experience with lori and great western, as i said, was smooth as could be.
Lori always responded promptly and was always able to help with whatever i needed.
I definitely recommend working with lori!
I absolutely love how helpful and polite every employee at this location is!
I had to stop in a few times this past week and margaret mims is absolutely fantastic.
Thank you so much for your help!
I really like midfirst bank!
True five star rating!
Insurance can be confusing to me, but mary makes it so easy and comfortable!
Her and her team are awesome!
Great service and i feel like they really are there for me!
Easy to access with big parking lot and mail pick up right outside.
Always quick and painless when i come in there.
These guys (women actually as i've never encountered any dudes there) are friendly and super efficient.
It's a bit hard to find the place from the sidewalk, hopefully this photo will help !
Kyle miller helped me with a loan.
He was knowledgeable and gave me options so i could choose the best way to borrow at the lowest rate.
Friendly and professional, kyle was awesome.
It was a great banking experience.
I would definitely recommend oncu and kyle.
If used several different banks so far and chase has been the one the most satisfies my financial needs.
This specific location has great customer service and makes sure everyone is helped as soon as possible.
The manager also comes around to greet and make sure we are taken care of.
Had an accident and they handled it promptly, paying it all out within a few days.
Worked with the body shop of my choice, without a hitch.
Banking has been excellent customer service as well, even with dealing with complex fraud issues.
My favorite bank of choice and i've used a few over my years.
Cant go wrong here.
Employees are very attentive and friendly.
The parking is plentiful and the hours are very suitable.
Amazing company to do business with in every regard.
They stand behind their values.
They care about their members and they demonstrate that daily!
I just because an employee for usaa and may i just say...wow!!!!
Happies person in the world!!!
Only and best agent i've ever had.
This office is amazing and has taken care of me for almost 20 years!
The ladies over at nsb are the best.
They are so helpful and courteous.
I will be a forever nevada state bank customer.
Everyone at state farm was very kind.
If you need an insurance agent, contact mary!
Helen and ricardo - thank you!
What a day with wells fargo and i can not thank you enough for listening to me as a human!
Respecting me as a person!
We all fall on hardship sometimes and i appreciate the help, thank you helen saenz!!!
Not only do they know my name when i walk in the door but they know my children's name.
They always go above and beyond.
They will even come out to my car and take my cash for me when my kids are asleep.
I wouldn't bank anywhere else!
Amanda was a life saver.
Thanks again amanda and discover card
Erica is always ready to answer my questions and provide the best guidance she can!
They all couldn't be more helpful!
I've been a one nevada cu member for over 10 years.
Since moving to this side of town i have been using this branch.
The people here are amazingly friendly and know me by name.
I rarely visit other branches any more!
I've been going into this branch for about a year now.
I bought a house down the street and this branch is on the way to work.
I usually zip in and out of there.
All the tellers are awesome.
All know me by name.
The only downside to this location is that it is near a senior living neighborhood.
And let me tell you, the worst thing about this branch are the customers.
I am always getting cut in line.
Like an unreal amount.
Am i really that invisible?
One customer even told me i had a ridiculous hair cut.
Yet the poor tellers get the brunt of it.
Also, no one fills out their slips which makes the wait time even longer.
What's wrong with you people.
The slips are out there while you wait in line, theres even a pen provided!
Fill out your slip!!
Even so, when the tellers get chewed out, they never transfer that energy to the next person.
They just keep on smiling.
Kudo's to you guys!
Keep up the great work and great service!
The customer service at this location is phenomenal!
Chris helped my beautiful lover, christine,  and i open a joint checking account.
We just moved to az from alabama.
We were insured with mary several years ago.
Mary's office and team are caring, helpful and amazing!
I always get excellent customer service here, in and out in less than 5 minutes.
Security guard & tellers are all so friendly and efficient!
Sorry so short, but not much to say about a bank...lol!
The staff here are amazing!
I had some challenges with my account and scott mulvan was great about helping fix it.
Customer service here is way above average!
When my husband and i got married 9 years ago he had this account.
I was not sure about it because i have always used banks.
My experience has been nothing but good.
They loaned us money for a car at a much lower interest rate.
The i retest on our savings is better than the bank.
I have only good things to report about this branch.
This location does exist and is open for business!
It's next to jersey mikes sandwich shop!
Open 9-5 mon- thurs, 9-6 friday and 10-2 on saturday.
No one fights for their clients like mary.
Strongly recommended to all potential home buyer, casey is on the top of it, super aa+++++++++++ all western mortgage.
Best branch in the state.
These guys are all so nice and helpful.
Even we i move i'm going to be coming here for all my banking needs
Great service and great price!
Currently i have my auto insurance, renters insurance, auto loan, and life insurance with this agency.
They continue to help me save money on my insurance and everyone is very friendly.
I have been with state farm since i was 16 and i love their discounts for loyalty.
Hands down some of the best customer service i have ever received.
Thank you state farm.
Open till 7 and open on sundays?!
Your the best huntington.
Staff is always very friendly here.
They always have pepperidge farm cookies on the counter on fridays.
Started our relationship with usaa with life insurance about 4 years ago.
We don't live near an office so all of our dealings have been with the corporate office or on line.
Eventually, we'll be transferring all of our banking and insurance over to them..
Turns out they were premium bonds, and they were only cash-able in december....but debbie matthews saved the day!
She set me up with a line of credit and i was off on my trip with out a hitch.
National bank just moved to their new chi-chi location in the new development off bayview ave.
It's much more modern then their old location, and their hours have improved to serve their customers better.
If you need a mortgage, go see debbie...tell her the crazy red head lindsey sent you.
Chris was great helping me with opening another account today.
He was very detailed and accommodating with my needs today.
I have lived in vegas previously and i know that vegas people are not very friendly in general.
Thank you chris and staff at this location!!
Adam and hannah boles and their team are true mortgage professionals.
They were always available to take our calls or respond to our emails.
They were able to complete our purchase loan from start to finish in 14 days.
They are quick, knowledgeable and always willing to go the extra mile to get the job done.
They always have the customer's best interest in mind and will make sure you get the best deal available.
I highly recommend them for any of your home loan needs.
Great rates on loans and credit card.
I don't know what more you can ask from a financial institution.
I wholeheartedly recommend aloha pacific!
I no longer live in wi and i still bank with summit, all online and through cu services.
Never in last 24 years have i ever had a bad experience nor been treated unprofessionally, seriously; no lie.
No i did not receive any sort of remuneration for this post.
Well you know what, don't get mad the next time your account gets breached.
It's a bank, not the express line at walmart.
They're dealing with high amounts of cash on a daily and also rude ass customers(such as yourself).
Give them a break.
I love the staff here.
Josh, amanda, barb, and evelyn are the coolest/nicest tellers i've ever had the pleasure of doing business with.
We were about  to give up and just rent again.
When we first talked she was super pleasant,kind and answered all my questions.
Casey helped us make our dreams possible, i am glad to say that we are homeowners now!
I thank god for that day that our friend jessica gave us casey's contact info.
Couldn't have done it without them!!
Thank you casey for making it possible!
Mary is such a passionate person.
She takes the time to understand the your unique situation and needs.
She works hard to find the best plan for the buck.
I've used wells fargo for my last two cars.
The interest rates were great and i would do business with them again.
As banks go, chase has gone a long way to improve.
They now offer overdraft notfication so you can fix it before getting charged.
They have the scan your check feature allowing you to deposit checks without actually going to the bank.
And most importantly, everyone is very friendly.
I am glad i switched back.
This bank of the west location is by far the most friendly, knowledgeable staff in las vegas.
Thank you for your service and on-going professionalism.
I'm happy to be part of your family.
Love this location every single time i come here  everyone seems very nice .
They have great customer services i will definitely come back.
Best mortgage broker on the planet.
Casey is truly the best broker i have ever worked with.
She understands her customer needs, and provides the right solution.
She also has an in depth knowledge of the mortgage market, which makes dealing with her very pleasant.
Jfk financial is the best company to work with to make your dreams of owning a home a reality!
I wouldn't go anywhere else!
The tellers were super knowledgeable, helpful and friendly.
The only reason i came to this branch was to get an on the spot debit card.
The chase banker was able to resolve the issue on the spot and bring the customer's anxiety down.
This is presently my branch of bank of america.
The staff is helpful if you have any kinds of issues.
I appreciated the quick and compassionate service, as i was pretty freaked out.
I am shocked to read the online reviews of wfds.
Were excellent the 2nd time around, with constant updates on the status of my loan app and follow through.
I had my loan documents a day after approval and overnighted it back to them by fed-ex, at their expense.
Best customer service from margaret mins!
She helped me out tremendously!!
I love this branch!
I've been with this bank for almost 10 years and i wouldn't bank anywhere else!
Joshua and andy are very helpful and they spend time to make sure everything is addressed
This review is basically for a recent experience i had here.
I was greeted immediately and asked what i needed help with.
My problem was that another person was getting emails about an account they aren't on.
He made sure that the person's email or phone number wasn't on that account anywhere, which it wasn't.
So, unfortunately, he wasn't able to help me any.
I gave this experience a 4 star only because they weren't able to fix a problem that was their fault.
I did end up closing down the account.
Wonderful experience, i really hate going in to the bank.
Lost my atm card and alex burruel made my transaction painless and quick!
Knowledgeable and friendly staff.
I feel welcomed when i first walk.
I've only been there twice so far but the staff recognized me from the first visit.
We tried to get pre-approval letters from our banks and no luck.
They wouldn't help us figure out why it wasn't getting approved.
Found casey through yelp with amazing reviews and decided to try her out.
Working with casey was amazing.
She went through underwriter to get our pre-approval letter and everything went smooth sailing.
We were able to close 8 days earlier.
Thank you casey for helping us purchase our 1st home in vegas.
Will recommend friends and family to you!
I was in a tight spot and needed some money to pay bills.
They were very nice, but the process took almost 2 hours to complete.
Smaller chase location by avon lake.
Tellers provided great customer service, they were very pleasant and courteous.
I chose casey to handle my refinance after a bad experience with an internet company.
This was the smoothest transaction i've ever had in closing a loan.
From start to finish, casey was on top of everything.
I can't say enough about the level of service i received.
I wouldn't hesitate to recommend her to anyone who is looking to buy a home or refinance their mortgage.
So i was in a jam and needed some money to pay my rent.
Borrow money against your car?
I didn't even know this was possible!!
The whole process was really easy and only cost me a couple hundred bucks.
Hopefully it won't be necessary but if i'm in a jam again i know where to go.
Nobody wants to review a title loan place because it's really embarrassing.
And a lot of other things negative.
Like me :)  very friendly, professional, quick to make a decision, no crazy questions, etc.
If you need to borrow against your car this is the place.
Jeremy clemena, a member advocate at the branch, recently helped me with a small loan.
He made the process so easy and updated me throughout the process.
He's a consummate professional and i wouldn't trust anyone else with my finances!
If you are looking for a loan, opening an account, financial advice, and more, don't hesitate to go to jeremy!
My husband and i had applied for a mortgage with at least 4 other mortgage companies.
We had been told time and time again we had to wait  another year.
Throughout the purchase process, mike was always available either via email, text, or cell.
If we had any questions (and we had many), mike would immediately call or email us with answers.
We are extremely grateful to mike and the team at jfk for helping us purchase our home.
Opened a checking account with art!
He's awesome and very helpful!
Easiest account setup ever!
I am in the process of relocating to charlotte, nc and was calling local insurance agencies for different quotes directly.
I was shopping for a multi-policy quote, renter's+automobile+motorcycle.
Seems easy, but the renter's insurance needed to include covering my pet, a pitbull.
First, it wasn't an easy task to find insurance agencies that cover pits.
So i already feeling discouraged.
I was going alphabetical and here i was s-for state farm.
Tyler at this office chuckled and gladly answered "yes, we do, aren't they just big babies?"
Anyways, when tyler said "aren't they just big babies?"
I knew, he knew.
I was relieved - weight lifted off my shoulders, yes!
He was friendly and i received quotes promptly.
I can finally rest assured, that this transition will be easy.
Thanks tyler at state farm!
I needed a loan and she made the process simple and easy to understand.
I would recommend maximum title loans in chandler!
I will be a return customer for sure.
Another great experience with the newer guy today!
Blonde brown hair... younger... approached with a smile... eager to help!
Maybe she should retire??
Stop by for a soda, an awesome hot dog bar was abundant with accesories.
Love the "sausage" a.k.a.
I typically use the atm only at this branch, but decided to go in today.
I don't trust the atm when making a deposit, i'm a bit old school when it comes to certain things!
I was surprised they had a greeter that immediately welcomed me with a smile.
She offered to help teach me to do a deposit on my phone with the app.
After a couple tries i got impatient and gave up on the app..
I thanked her then moved on to a teller.
There was no line and three tellers available.
I don't know what all the bad reviews are about, maybe today was just my lucky day?!
The gentleman teller was friendly and quick.
It's good to know great service is available.
This'll be my go-to branch for now.. hopefully i won't have to change my review!
We love to travel and we just found our go-to place to exchange currency.
They give a good rate with no added fees.
The two ladies in the front were really nice and helpful.
They quickly did the currency exchange calculation and got me on my way.
Be sure to bring a passport if changing over $1000.
Park underground near the tower side of the building and take the elevator up to the first floor.
Go through the double doors to suite 101.
This place is amazing!
I called last week to check their rate/fees and how long it would take .
I needed euros, pounds and icelandic kronas, but i wasn't able to make it down until monday.
Sure enough she had it aside for me.
What made me more happy is their rate is better than any bank!
They don't charge additional fees and it is immediate!
Thank you so much for your service!
Tip: exchange is cash only and no coins.
If you are exchanging more than $1,000 usd bring your passport only or photo id and social security card
I've been with uw credit union for over a decade and have been very happy with them.
I'll never go back to a bank.
There's something about the service here that makes this hsbc branch superior to the others.
On weekdays, this branch tends to not be too busy.
However, on weekends, there's lineups for the tellers that stretch for several customers.
Every teller does this, which is quite nice.
There is an express lane for premier customers, however it's not that clearly defined in this branch.
The rightmost lane closest to the windows is for premier customers.
It's a little hard to find but definitely worth looking for.
Excellent exchange rates and great customer service.
Can't go wrong with this bunch.
Been using this specific chase branch since i moved to az in '10.
Never had a problem.
The employees are always nice and friendly and i've built a good relationship with them.
Wait times are awesome.
Never had to wait more than a few minutes.
Two atms outside and 2 drive thrus also.
I am very pleased with the level of service i have received from clearview federal credit union.
They process my mail in a timely manner.
Working with clearview is cooperative, simple and smart.
Other than that setback, i also wish i knew more about their investment practices.
As a member/owner, i don't feel that i am in reach of understanding and participating in their banking decisions.
Best insurance group to be part of!!!
Great rates for my entire family and i even saved money on my home insurance.
I highly recommend it to everyone.
My first time at this location.
From the reviews on this bank location i was kind of spective of it.!
But i had no other choice i was in the area.
Unfortunately the reviews on this location look pretty bad but i'm always optimistic.
Any who.. with that said i had a great experience..!
I was attended very quickly, by second i walked in by a bank teller.
I had several different currency bills and they exchanged all of them in one transaction.
Super happy i found this place.
I've already recommended it to my travel companion.
This branch is located near my house, so i frequent it for payroll and my own deposits.
The staff is friendly and the drive thru is quick.
It is a convenient location for me to do business.
This is a stand alone building with drive thru tellers and drive thru and walk in atm.
You can get literally anything that you need while on a car ride (mobile accessories, food, drink, snacks, newspapers).
Amazing amount of options.
But the key is the customer service, because their staff genuinely gives a damn about you, and treats you well.
I'll always be loyal for this place when on business trips to phoenix area because they deserve it.
The staff here is always courteous & the store is always exceptionally clean.
Nothing like a little hard work to earn something.
Thanks for offering this program barnes & noble!
What a great location.
Greeted at door, offered water, directed to the correct teller.
Line got big so they took resources from other areas and opened up more windows.
Held the door open for me.
Actually a very pleasant transaction when i normally don't ever have anything but complaints about banks.
My teller reyna ochoa was very pleasant professional and efficient.
Joellen did a fantastic job walking me through a new auto and renters policy.
She was patient while i shopped around and followed up when she said she would.
I look forward to joellen and her team servicing my policies.
Very clean well organized.
Staff were very friendly to alley.
There was a wide selection of products and staff were able to quickly locate wanted items.
This is an awesome office.
Very responsive and went the extra mile.
Ulyanna has called me on my birthday every year as well.
Even my previous 3 agents were good.
If we could keep out of state agents id stay with her office forever.
Any southwest or vegas peeps looking.
Check her office out.
Since it is summer time, call ahead to make sure they have what you need!
Also, notice the 4:00.
Also lucky that they had some pesos!
They didn't have as much as i needed not it was better than coming back!
Like others have stated, great customer service and polite even though i was in after closing.
If i could give them more stars i would!
This crew has helped me for a good three years!
If i have any issues or questions they were always available to answer them.
They never gave me attitude they were understanding and helped me through the issue.
She is really there to help you.
I appreciate you all so much!
Best customer service ever for a bank!
Tremendous service and people.
Been banking there for over 10 years now without an issue
I recommend them if you need your money exchanged!
No charges or fees :)
I had an overall good experience.
I had to wait to see a banker but it was during the lunch hour so i could understand.
Opened a checking account and it was pretty easy no hassle at all.
The staff was friendly, helpful and competent.
The few times i've been inside this bank there's been  no one else there.
So naturally they were pretty quick with service.
Quick and easy money exchange at great rates.
Funny thing is, the ladies behind the counter have not traveled much.
But they are making their kids travel (study abroad, live abroad, and so on).
Gourgous counter people ,very proffestioal, somtimes get you in right away.
I chose to just stay in there but i thought the consideration and manners were great.
Well before 30 minutes was up i spoke with joshua haynie who was absolutely fantastic.
I couldn't recommend it, or joshua, more highly.
Refi  rocky start, communication problems.
Looks like it's all sorted out.
If everything goes through as they say, i will be very happy.
This could be the dream ending...
You have many choices when it comes to banking, branches like this make me wonder why others still exist.
I'm no billionaire, more like a thousandaire but they treat me respect and service that is unmatched.
Allstars in the banking biz
Miss dejanay sollas was the banker who assisted me.
I needed to refinance my auto loan.
Dejanay was quite accommodating and professional.
She is kind and her customer service is unbelievable.
She took care of the entire process quickly and efficiently.
She made sure that i provide all the documents needed for refinance with one nevada.
I also asked her to open me accounts and she proceeded with grace.
She explained with utmost care and compassion all the information i needed to know.
Dejanay sollas is a problem solver and a sight for sore eyes.
She should be a role model for all bankers nationwide.
And thank you one nevada for having her.
Our representative, teresa popp was wonderful!
I couldn't be more impressed with teresa or happier with our choice for his first bank.
Thanks to a couple employees at this location, they helped me solve an uncommon checking account situation immediately.
Michael was extremely professional and helpful.
Very happy i chose to go to this branch.
Would definitely recommend if you're planning on opening a new account or credit card.
Convenient location (closest intersection: jones and spring mountain).
1 atm in the front, possibly 2 in the drive thru area in the back (never used before).
Staff was pleasant to interact with, just the way they were trained to do by corporate or the branch manager.
Plenty of parking spaces whenever i am here.
In which case try to use the center turning lane, and frogger your way over as needed.
Just be careful of north-bound vehicles that want to turn left onto spring mountain rd.
Don't want no real life game over head on collision or hassles with insurance companies and five-os.
Peace in the south china sea.
My bf and i finally decided to make the commitment and open a joint checking account for our bills.
We booked an appointment with ct, who was highly recommended by friends.
He walked us through everything he was doing and answered all of our questions.
He made sure that we were comfortable with our decision and even gave us options for future investments.
He's super funny, so it didn't even feel like we were there long.
I would definitely recommend him for your banking needs.
Thanks ct, you're awesome!
I took a visit to one nevada , and 30 minutes in i felt i had been a lifelong member.
Sometimes it only takes one person to represent a company, and shape your entire experience as a client.
Linda woodford was that person.
I have never felt so comfortable working with someone that i have never met before.
I went into one nevada to get the details on an auto loan.
I will absolutely be returning to one nevada to see linda whenever i need help with financial services.
My husband and i were on vacation in arizona and needed some hotel snacks.
We pulled into this store and were shocked!
Its a typical convenience store and then some!!
They have a wall of slushies (sugar free options, too!
What i liked best was the hot dog toppings!
There wasn't food splashed everywhere.
I don't drink soda, so the freshly brewed iced tea was a nice treat!!
There were even chairs outside where you can snack, smoke or just take a break.
The workers were friendly and courteous.
I wish we had a place like this back home!
I've been a part of the oneaz family since college about 14 years.
I love this credit union.
I've had three car loans including my most recent purchase of my outlander candy apple red beauty.
This time i had the pleasure of dealing with justin.
He's so helpful and patient with the whole car buying process.
So make sure to ask for justin when needing a loan and he'll make sure everything works out smoothly.
Great service by janet at this bank.
A new pin number and cashier's check issued/printed in less than 10 minutes.
I'm a happy girl.
The place is bigger than it looks from the outside and is clean.
No annoying music or tv playing either.
They had the a/c on perfect temperature as well.
Friendly staff members that always take care of me and my family.
Great rates, friendly and helpful service.
It was our first time but will now come only here for forex.
Super simple and fast.
Way better than the casino rate i was told at aria and no exchange fees.
This place is located in the tower and not the plaza.
It's a regular office layout.
I've come to this branch a bunch of times and they're always extremely friendly and willing to help out.
The lines move pretty quickly too!
I love 1 nevada credit union easy convenient always here for me
Four stars for having a security guard near the atm during business hours.
Makes me confident that my atm  withdrawels are going to me instead of a thug.
I have been to this branch numerous times.
So far i have had zero complaints.
I switched to this location because my agent's  office wasn't professional at all.
I started out with a young man named daniel who was very knowledgeable about everything i needed.
They have always returned my calls the same day, and took care of any issues i've had.
Branch employees do seem to be laid back in asking about accounts most of the time.
However, they do help me out all the time.
They also help waive some overdrafts when i did have checks deposited that may have not cleared yet.
Not all the time but enough to help and as much as they possible could.
Everyone is friendly and helpful....
I've known jared for over 10 years and have my auto/home and recently life policy with him.
I trust jared with everything from my golf cart to my life possessions.
Never a hassle and always great communication.
Convenient location with separate atm drive-thru for many people to drive up and use.
Never needed to go inside.
And what to expect and so on.
I also visited with a teller for change into smaller bills.
Great convenience store with good drink prices and gas prices.
Needed to wire some money fast.
Very helpful and accurate - just what i needed.
One of my favorite locations to go to!
Always friendly and accommodating.
They have many book events and activities that are friendly to families and kids.
Love coming here for coffee too.
Efficient, fast, and professional!
Did a refi on my car and erin had it done in less than a week!
The customer service was above and beyond what anyone would expect.
I was supremely pleased to know that there was no minimum to open the account for a child.
Thank you for everything and keep up the good work.
Fast is an understatement.
Two cashiers, two terminals, handling two customers at once - one on each side.
This is their business model - awesome!
Hot tea, iced tea, flavored tea, brewed tea, boxed jarred and sunned tea.
I think i will quit my professional job and work at a qt if they ever come to michigan.
My boyfriend and i go to this chase all the time, since it is the closest to our house.
The service is always great and friendly, but this last visit really impressed me.
We were seated with besart sezairi, i think i spelled it wrong, and he was beyond helpful.
Thank you so much, besart!!
I'm always in a rush & quickly explained my needs to heather pearce while making my appointment.
She instantly understood my personal & business financial goals & had an outline ready for me!
Heathers personality is fantastic!
She got to know me in such a short time & knew how to cater to my true financial needs.
Thank you again heather pearce.
Without brining anything into the review like interest rates or services offered i'll provide a review.
Their hours have improved over the years and now it is possible to get here after work on some days.
Whether you have to go to just the window or back to speak with a banker the workers are friendly.
I recognise a lot of faces always - turnover is low.
The place is always clean and the parking lot of large enough and private which is great for the area.
The atm requires you to get out of your car but it is accessible from outside.
This is located at the denison / w25th intersection which makes quick access to 176 and other highways easy.
Huge fan of this place, because it's real close to home.
This location is located next to albertson.
Parking can be busy at times.
Very nice and courtesy crew.
I have been coming here for two reason.
My father had his account here, and my credit union in california can be serviced from here.
Service: when my father passed away last year, i had to deal with desert schools for my fathers financials.
It was frustrated at times, they make sure all the paper work is in and they are very thorough.
Basically that's a good thing.
But in time, everything was able to be transferred into the estate account.
I was also very surprised that they will answer their phones in person.
Very convenient when you don't have much time to wait around for a call back or being placed on hold.
Just opened account, received wonderful service and so far so good.
The checking account had no fees and includes rewards as well.
Impressive that checks and debit cards can all be made on-site.
If only cali had pit stops like these!!
All we have is chevron's and am/pm which is no comparison to this place!!
I got a 44oz mango limeade for about 2 bucks or so!
They sold pretty affordable iphone charger as well.
15 bucks duracell brand compared to the $20 china knock off at the mall.
What do you want me to tell you it's an atm.
Put your card in and pull out your cash.
Thank enjoy your own money
Great bank so far.
I like my main branch on pinnacle peak but this is a good backup location close to my house.
It's a little more laid back and relaxed location.
They seem like good neighborhood bank.
Don't forget to check out the pinnacle peak location.
I have never had to wait more than 10 minutes to be seen at this bank!
Grade a service on all fronts.
I have always been followed up with if i left with any concerns.
Little bit of back story.
I grew up in tucson.
We had circle k's (ok) and quickmarts (usually ghetto).
I was instantly hooked.
I pull in and see the building is oval and their are chairs and tables outside.
Hmmmm, ok i'm intrigued.
Then i see a sign that says soft serve cones.
Qt raised the bar on itself.
You have exceeded expectations again!
I stop at this location after work sometimes and i find it to be very convenient with drive up banking!
The lines aren't normally long and the tellers are friendly.
Figuring out how to get into the parking lot was i have to admit odd for me.
When you pull in where i did, you have to drive up and around to get to the bank.
I wasn't sure i was in the right spot.
It looks like they have more building maybe to do and it will be more complete at a later date.
Best mortgage experience ever.
Greg and state farm bank made it very simple and painless.
Loan was funded quickly and with ease.
I love working with the ladies at this office.
They are always kind and helpful and always follow up to see how we are doing.
Their customer service is great and would highly recommend them.
Twas the  friday before new years and the bank seemed to be packed.
They had 6 tellers with a greeter.
Before i knew it, i was in and out due to them being soo efficient.
They shortened the line by taking customers who had deposits only, in the drive thru area.
This is my new go to location.....even though its kind of far from my house.
Joellen and her team are great.
They are knowledgeable and professional.
Great service and a great company.
I love this store.
But their book selection doesn't feel as good as other locations.
I really enjoy going to their deal section and looking at the cookbooks on sale.
You can get some great deals on really good cookbooks.
Looking forward to my next trip.
Thanks bank of america and thanks victor
It is not very crowded and most visits are quick and painless.
A long time ago, well a few years ago, this used to be a wachovia.
And when i needed to go to wf, i'd have to go down to albertson's to visit their mini-branch there.
Ps...this is my 300th review!
Jessika is the reason why i became a wells fargo customer.
She's very helpful, patient,  and ensures my banking needs are met.
Shout out to kristen for giving us a hand!
I am moving from virginia to arizona and was referred to mike miller's agency by my virginia agent.
Shelby answered the phone and we have spoken many times since then.
She is the nicest, most welcoming person i have ever spoken to on the phone.
Both her and the office manager, matthew, have worked hard to make sure my policies transfer seamlessly when i move.
I am so happy to have been referred to this office.
Thank you to matthew and shelby!
Went to open an account for my 16 yr old daughter.
She is so excited to deposit her very first paycheck.
The bank attendant who helped us was so clear and understanding.
It was a great experience for everyone.
She received her bank card today and screamed with excitement.
Not really sure why, because she is saving for college.
The best customer service.
You won't wait long and they respect your time.
The associates are very kind and  helpful
Once again you were right.
I had no idea this place even existed.
Plus i felt secure and confident buying my euros here.
Bring your parking ticket in with you to get validated  (even the parking was reasonable  $1.00 per 30 minutes).
We were only in the office for 10 minutes (with 3 people ahead of us).
Otherwise you will be looking for it.
We will be returning for future trips.
In order to establish nv residency, i had to get a local checking account.
I researched all the lv and nv banks and this is the one that i picked.
Setting up my new account was very easy, and the customer service at this branch was great.
There is not enough parking, however, or i just went there at a very busy time.
Overall, i have been happy with my new account, and happy with my choice.
She informed me she would handle my problem.
I am new to henderson or las vega, and i depend on yelp at all times for good information,
I was referred to ulyanna by my mother for my homeowners and auto policies a couple years ago.
Both ulyanna and daniel have been always extremely helpful!
The service is so personal!
Today was the first time my fiancé and i met either agent in person and we had a wonderful experience!!
Ulyanna was so personable and she had a genuine interest in our lives.
She also took the time to explain our existing policies and different options that were available.
So, i would say it's definitely worth a personalized quote.
Tell them i sent you!
It's not my favorite location but i love the bank.
Mesa riverview is my peeps!
But a close 2nd is this branch
The best prices in town, i've done the research for you.
Extremely reasonable better than bank, airport amex any of them.
Save your money and go here
Honestly, i hope everyone reads as many reviews as possible before doing business with anyone.
The greeter came out to welcome us within 5 mins of walking in, signing in & sitting down.
Representatives are nice & engaging.
At the counter, the bankers always offer my children a sucker before leaving.
Keep up the great work!!
Went in to set up a checking account for my trust and the process was super simple.
All of the staff was welcoming and the gentleman who set me up, patrick, was awesome.
Highly recommend this location!
In planning my first trip to europe, i was getting overwhelmed at the thought of exchanging money.
In my research, i found this place.
The reviews were fantastic so i figured i would check it out to get some of my foreign currency pre-travel.
The rate listed on oanda was 1.2718 and 1.5458 respectively.
I was shocked that they were so close.
So, my decision was made and i was on my way!
When i first pulled in to the parking garage, i have to admit, i was scared.
I parked  next to the elevators and ran right into them with my cash.
There was a security guard in the little lobby area there so that calmed my nerves.
I walked in and the place was empty except for one lady behind the counter sitting in a desk.
All the exchanging was done within 4-5 minutes!
It was so easy!
What a breath of fresh(non-corporate banking mentality) air.
I will def use this place again!
The agents at this location are very nice!
We used to live around there and even though we moved, we still like to stop by.
The girls are so sweet and they are always asking about our kids and family.
We miss being so close.
This is for shelby and this location.
Great customer service skills!
As for the teller we all make mistakes.
My husband should of re counted the money as well before he left.
Im glad we were able to get it back!
The exchange rates here were good.
I bought yen with dollars.
Location: i felt a bit lost, but was able to locate it with some guidance with the people there.
I parked in the garage and got my ticket validated.
The place looks clean and it was easy exchanging at the counter.
It does feel sketchy from the old building and the people around.
Driving here, there were some construction going on around the complex.
This place is convenient to me as i work around the area.
It was only a few minutes away and is now my favorite place for currency exchanges.
I had to exchange euros for dollars recently and foreign money exchange came very highly recommended here on yelp.
All this even though i have an account at the bank.
Instead of dealing with all that i took the yelpers' advice and went to fmc.
I'm happy i did.
Super easy to find, quick, friendly transaction and i got exactly the dollar amount i was expecting.
A very pleasant experience.
So, to recap, fmc was great.
My bank can suck it.
Banks are banks, and generally evil.
The people who work here are quite nice and make the bank a reasonable experience.
That gets them four stars, despite being the root of all evil.
Best bank i've ever used!
At bmo they didn't make this a barrier.
I love the mobile app because i can check my balance, deposit checks and transfer funds without leaving home.
Great customer service at the bank itself.
I can't physically use the atm so i go inside to make deposits, and i always get wonderful service.
The tellers are always kind and helpful.
The lobby is clean and well kept.
Today i needed to replace my debit card.
I recently became part of the first credit union family and i'm happy i did.
My dealings with ericka and holly were great.
I also visited the branch in chandler and they were awesome.
I was provided excellent service and was made to feel welcomed.
I really appreciate receiving first class service.
This is the location located on the northeast corner of green valley pkwy and sunset drive.
I stop here from time to time and i have always been pleased with the service i recieve here.
When there is a line, it always moves at a reasonably fast pace.
The ctellers have always been friendly and pleasant, while still being efficient.
Was here a few weeks ago and the gentleman who assisted me was quick, professional, and very friendly.
He made the transaction painless and enjoyable.
Another gentleman even offered me a bottle of cold water.
This place is wonderful!
They are as good as all of their reviews!
Park down in the garage & it's a bit of a hunt to find them but just ask security.
The ladies are so friendly & helpful and no extra fees.
Just the buy & sell rate!
Best i've heard of in las vegas!
Bring in your parking pass & they validate it for you!
Mark and his team are great.
Jody treats us like family.
I highly recommend this agency for all your insurance needs.
They are a full service state farm agency.
They also offer financial services.
I called today and spoke with joey, i needed assistance with one of my patients bank accounts.
After joey got authorization from the patient, he was able to assist me so that i could assist my patient.
You made today a little easier.
I called on two different occasions with questions, i spoke with 2 different women, both were pleasant and informative.
I finally went down to exchange dollars to euros.
The woman who helped me (missed her name) was soooo nice.
She was helpful and quick to exchange what i needed.
I expected more of a hassle but was pleasantly surprised at the ease of the transaction.
If you're going to enchanted more than $1000us be prepared to bring additional documents.
I was not so i didn't have any problem.
Couldn't find euros at the casinos either.
I'll be back again before my trip to exchange some more.
Absolutely incredible customer service and so easy to exchange at the current rate, no additional charges.
Was able to get the swiss franc and the euro with no problem.
Tip - follow the other tips for parking, but make sure you park near the tower elevator parking.
It's not in the plaza.
I've been with clearview for 27 years and have always loved all the employees who have assisted me.
Recently, i spoke with jean for an auto loan and she was extremely friendly and personable!
Central illinois was my first bank account out of high school and i love them.
I'm leaving central illinois and leaving this bank is going to be one of the hardest parts.
With their new acceleration banking, it's the best rates i've come across.
Service was always personal and (up until a few years ago) i always recognized faces.
Your best branch managers and long time employees are leaving and your current employees just don't seem happy anymore.
You're trying to draw in people who don't want to bank with big banks...so don't be one.
Two months ago, we experienced a flood in our home, which damaged a large part of our kitchen.
It's never fun when there's extensive damage, but we weren't worried, because we have homeowner's insurance through state farm.
Almost 30 years and two claims, state farm has always come through for us.
I contacted our local agent, mark citsay, and explained the situation.
More importantly, he followed up weekly - sometimes daily - with the state farm estimator and claims specialist.
Mark citsay has been our agent for nearly 20 years, and it's this kind of dedication which proves why!
Ulyanna and her staff have the best response time i have ever seen when i need a question answer.
This office has one of the best customer service i have ever seen.
I now have all my insurance with ulyanna and state farm.
Auto, health, workers comp., you name it.
I highly recommend and with their competitive quotes they are certainly one of the best.
I've been meaning to try this place and finally had the opportunity to do so.
They always have the best rate!
Staff members are courteous and friendly!
The only thing i hope is that they can open late on some days!
They close at 4pm which is not easy for me to make it there!
I highly recommend them.
I exchanged euros today with out calling ahead.
Yahoo shows 1.115 euro to 1 dollar...they paid 1.1380.
I'm so glad i noticed they are downstairs from my office before my vacation.
Nicest people in the world.
Some of these reviews are hilarious.
Use an atm bro or get direct deposit.
If anything you're holding me up because the bank makes no money off you.
Don't want to wait in line?
Here's a solution: manage your money better.
Stop needing your $500 available today instead of tomorrow.
You're wasting everyones time including your own.
Also, taking a picture in a bank makes you a creeper.100% creeper!
I was literally in and out!
There was no line, and i was assisted by elizabeth, who was very kind.
They gave me $585 cad for $545 usd!
Plus they validate your parking!
They are the best :)
This place was a little hard to find because it's in a nondescript office building.
Parking is underneath the building in a garage.
Make sure to take your parking ticket with you to get it validated by the foreign money exchange too!
When i got there i was instantly greeted and helped out.
They exchanged my peruvian soles for pretty much almost an even rate.
I was in and out within 5 minutes.
This place is awesome for exchanging currency.
I've only been to the atm here but everything works great and is fast.
It's also in a good neighborhood so i don't worry about getting cash late at night.
Really happy to have this bofa not fare from my home.
The services are really good and the staff is really friendly.
What i like about this place is that they have a really big parking lot!
Thats always a plus.
Only downside is there is always a line!!
But the staff is very freindly !
I came in to update my code for my sf bank card (yes, state farm has a bank people!)
Ana was quick to acknowledge me and very friendly while assisting me.
She was very helpful in getting me in contact with sf bank.
She got me water and made sure i was ok before i left the office.
Thank you ana for helping me out and making this experience seamless.
One of the best i've been in.
Huge selection, nice layout, awesome staff!
I don't even remember names of people i met yesterday, lol!!
I am impressed with one of the banker, her professionalism, knowledge, and just the way she is... a great person!!!
This is customer service, treat everyone equally.
I really like this location it is so much faster than the one in goodyear.
The staff is much more friendlier.
They also look like they know what they are doing.
Easy access for me just to exit freeway and walk in and walk out.
There are no drive thru tellers which is fine because there is plenty of parking in lot.
This location is right next to albertsons.
This store is always very busy, but you can still get in & out quickly.
The employees are awesome.
I like the large selection of drink choices that are offered, self serve, refrigerator section or made to order drinks.
Then there is the huge selection of food items, which includes snack foods, fruit, sandwiches, breakfast and lunch items.
No matter how busy you do not have to wait long to fill up your gas tank.
I went here to exchange usd to euros.
The transaction was easy & fast!
I also got a great rate, extremely reasonable.
Based on xe, the euro rate was .88€ = $1 usd.
They exchanged .86€ for every dollar.
Not bad at all.
Don't get fooled by travelex.
This is the place to go!
This is my favorite bank of all time.
I've been a loyal customer since community bank of nevada fell to fraud and they haven't let me down since.
The other lady's in the office were also helpful ..
Thank you all for the exceptional service and smiley faces
I love this branch.
Every time i need something, they are super friendly and fast.
I've never waited in line because they're always plenty of tellers.
Dalton has helped me with a couple of routine things and has always been efficient, friendly, and professional.
The manager hector is awesome and always says hello.
I would definitely come to this branch just because of the awesome crew working here.
Great customer service happens every time i visit this location, i have started skipping the atm.
She had my daughter's best interest in mind the entire time, i made the process extremely easy.
We will definitely be doing all of our business with zarina and wf.
I only get to exchange 200 usd to mexican pesos.
I guess i should have called ahead of the time.
According to her, mexican peso is the hardest one to keep.
Just a little fyi.
One other small detail, thanks for the little cup of coffee in the morning!
I've been going to this wells fargo since i've moved into my new house.
There is not anything wrong.
The tellers here are all nice.
The atm deposit has been a lifesaver for days where i need to get to work.
Ive been banking here for a little over a year and so far its been a great experience.
What puts them over the top for me is an experience i had earlier this month.
I was scheduled to have money taken out for an automatic payment on the 5th.
This is what a great bank does!
Could not be happier with banking with cib but only have a slight complaint.
I called ahead to make sure they had pesos, since i read in a previous review they run out.
I was able to come in the same day to get pesos.
The fee was about 3 percent.
Not too bad in my opinion.
Park in the underground parking lot, go up to the 1st floor and follow the signs to suite 101.
They will validate your parking ticket no problem.
Open a checking account and chase will give you $150.00 after your first direct deposit ..
I called my agent and when i discovered water leaking from my attic, and they gave some amazing advice!
I wasn't directed to the claims department, instead they suggested i call paul's restoration and carpet.
Who offered to come out the same day to investigate the damage.
This office had been nothing but amazing and helpful always answering my questions.
Gotta say - i wasn't really expecting such good and personal service.
I was not able to bring items in to the office but they were happy to look at pictures.
Mario got back to my email within 24 hours.
While they did not have a market for my items, gave me great and valuable information and advise.
I'll be back for sure.
It's exactly like every other barnes and noble i've ever been to, exactly.
It is usually difficult to get very happy with any bank.
By their very nature banks tend to suck...
But, not so with wells fargo and especially this mini-branch inside a safeway supermarket.
He set up accounts for ar, ap and equity.
Then he went on to approve a line of credit for the company that far exceeded what i expected.
This is the only place to do currency exchange in vegas!
Not the only one that does it, but the only one you should be doing business with.
Their rates are very fair.
They always have what i need.
They are vey good at what they do.
To the ladies at foreign money exchange, thanks for helping me out for the past sixteen years!
I was introduced to a personal banker named candice moore.
She was extremely helpful and very pleasant to speak with.
I will be coming back to this branch just to bank with candice.
I've banked with both the cotswold and noda branches... both have always been great to work with.
When i saw paura h's 1 star review i couldn't let that stand on its own.
Seriously everyone i have worked with at either location (i live right in the middle), has been great.
Oddly enough, fifth third bank does not serve food.
Yelp really is better for, you know, restaurants.
That's probably why this awesome bank only has 2 reviews.
My experience with clearview has gotten even better with the mobile app - now featuring mobile deposits!!!
I no longer have to worry about getting my checks to the bank; i can deposit them from anywhere, anytime.
Best thing to happen in my personal-banking life!
There are thorough, quick and pleasant to deal with.
They have a top-tier financial rating and are competitively priced even with companies that have a lower rated financial backing.
Great insurance through great people, i highly recommend this office.
Came in to this bank to wire money.
The teller we spoke to was nice and referred us to the banking manager linda.
Linda did our wire transfer and helped us order checks and change our address.
I felt like we known her forever lol.
Very pleasant lady and made this visit memorable for me and my wife.
We will definitely be using this branch for our banking needs.
On rare occasions, however, you need a little more.
Then the guy offered to fax it all for us which we thought was pretty cool of him.
If that's kind of customer service doesn't deserve five stars i must be missing out on something.
Other than the upstairs restroom being a disaster, i enjoyed my experience.
One employee approached me and asked if i needed any help.
She did her best to assist.
The upstairs level for children and teens was nice since my wife and daughter were with me.
I think at least this location is more welcoming.
There are some sitting areas for  reading.
I didn't feel rushed or pressured to buy anything.
I went in here to open a checking account.
The bank is very clean and everyone was very professional.
The staff seemed to know all the customers names and were very friendly.
So far...the experience has been great...i'll write another review after more time with the account.
Anna grigoryan provided the best banking service i've ever had with wells fargo.
I had some issues with wells fargo dealer services and the disconnect between the bank and the loan provider.
She was very professional in her articulation, demeanor, and appearance.
Anna is the best banker i've ever dealt with at any wells fargo branch.
If you need any issues resolved with your personal banking, i would highly recommend speaking with anna.
My husband and i have been members of first credit union since 1990.
There are tellers at each location that know me, by name, when i walk in the door.
I will always bank with a "credit union" as opposed to a "bank".
Website is good and easy to use.
Remote deposit is a great feature which allows me to take pictures of checks to deposit through the fcu app.
This really reduces how many times i need to actually visit the bank.
Also, a unique and powerful feature of credit union banking is "shared branch banking".
There are credit unions closer to where i live (arizona federal and truwest) that offer shared branch banking with fcu.
If i need to, i can go into their location and withdraw funds or make deposits into my fcu account.
I felt that there is another perspective to share....
Nice place, call ahead if you're getting pesos as they run out fast.
Staff is friendly and professional.
She was very sweet and helpful.
She even followed up to check and see how things were going with the account.
If you are in the area and have any questions, i would definitely recommend going to her.
So i'm in phoenix dealing with my father's affairs due to his passing.
I need to stop by and deposit some money so i find this gem.
The staff here are the friendliest i've ever met at a bank.
The tell introduces himself, shakes my hand, and is as helpful as it gets.
I went there the previous week and had the same experience.
This place definitely understands the idea of customer service.
If i lived in phoenix, i would go out of my way to bank here.
Matt and his team are super friendly, super efficient and helpful!
I've never met a branch in all my years behave this way.
I love going to "my" branch and taking care of business.
You see, they make me feel like i am wanted and that they care about my business.
Now when does this happen in the banking industry??
Right on you guys!
I will always recommend bofa scottsdale rd.
& flw any day of the week.
Very unhappy with wells fargo so went looking for somewhere else to put my money.
After several personal recommendations and lots of online research we chose one nevada.
We were fortunate enough to get dejanay as our financial service representative.
What a fantastic experience.
Even though they were very busy dejanay gave us all the time we needed.
She even explained why she stopped working at a traditional bank.
I manage a call center and know what good customer service looks like and this is it.
We will be moving all of our monies out of wells fargo and over to one nevada.
After extensive research, one nevada credit union is going to be my bank!
Will finally be ending my over 20 year relationship with wells fargo and unraveling all that goes with that.
Stopped in this evening and was immediately helped by the branch manager who explained all the great services to me.
He referred me to kyle who totally set me up.
Couldn't have been nicer!
Kyle re-explained the account choices and benefits!
Can't wait to utilize it all one nevada has to offer!
The location is convenient.
There is a atm inside or plenty of tellers on hand to help you inside.
I wish i could say more but that about sums it up lol.
Very professional and honest with a caring attitude - great job!
I am glad and thankful to have state farm - mark citsay as my insurance agent - thank you
Highest quality, discrete and better than market rates.
This is a nice qt.
It's right next to where i work so that's a plus.
It's very large, clean and the staff is friendly and efficient.
Friendly staff, i did buy some things at a good price, they seem fair to deal with.
Only $2 for season box set dvd
While i've been to many td branches, i want to highlight this one for their regularly excellent service.
I made it a point to let their branch manager know, who was thrilled to hear it.
It seems as though they make an effort to please the neighbourhood clientele.
It's nothing against them, but really, why settle for anything less than the best?
This is my preferred chase location.
Tellers are always nice and helpful.
They have not replaced them with atms and i hope they won't.
I have never had the personal service as i have had with this specific insurance agency.
They have made all of my insurance needs a cake walk.
The costs are low for the maximum amount of insurance without any hassle.
I would highly recommend joe janet state farm and his entire staff for any insurance needs.
Their costs are low and their coverage is more than adequate.
Way more than adequate.
They continually attempt to save me money on all services rendered, to give me the very lowest possible prices.
I am amazed at the service and the amazing staff that is available to me from a mere phone call.
They always keep me well informed of any new services that are available to myself or my family.
I have no intentions of ever switching to any other company.
Joe janet state farm has me covered!
I also love the entire staff!!
First impressions:  located at the corner of mcclintock and southern the branch was fairly empty at 2pm.
This to the customer service i am used from the branches in indiana.
It was refreshing to find it again.
This may become my home branch while in arizona.
It is my humble opinion that all banks suck.
With that said, i actually like the people that work at my citibank.
They are always friendly and very helpful.
Even the security guard that usually stands outside is hospitable and talkative.
I really wouldn't change a thing about this branch.
One star was deducted because they are a bank, all banks have some crappy policies.
Nothing against this branch in particular.
I felt welcomed and as if she was taking care of me like i was family.
The lowest interest rates around!
They have gas, food, clean restrooms.
They have it all.
Stopped in for some healthy snacks while traveling and were not disappointed.
This place is the best!!
I checked the exchange rate online before heading into foreign money exchange and their rate was spot-on.
They also told me they exchange money from u.s. to other nations currency.
Glad i found them.
The staff is efficient, kind and lead by a great bank manager.
I'm very pleased to call this location my branch.
To anyone who banks with jp morgan chase in surprise this is an excellent place to bank.
Banking should assist you, not be painful, this branch makes sure of that.
Keep up the great work.
For once in my life i actually got great service.
Keith graham (teller) was very helpful and courteous.
I have nothing bad to say about the service i received.
Hire more tellers like him.
Usually bofa always gives me problems but not today!
I will recommend this place to all my friends.
I am so excited to be a member of the one nevada family.
I opened an account with kyle miller at the e. serene location and he was extremely helpful, friendly and knowledgeable.
Looking forward to uses all of the credit union benefits.
I called ahead (i strongly recommend you do this), to see if they had two relatively rarer currencies available.
I told her i would be in within a few days and thanked her for her time.
The lady sitting at the back desk responded very rudely and abruptly with "and?!?!?!?
What am i supposed to do with that information?"
I said "well um, ok then..." and she then asked "can i at least have your name or something?
How am i supposed to know who you are?"
After i gave her the information she asked for, she went to the back and got the currency, and returned.
She was a lot nicer to me after she returned.
It was almost alarming actually how quickly her personality changed.
Regardless, there is zero excuse for this behavior.
That is not how you treat customers, especially customers who are not being rude to you.
The office itself was clean and well kept.
They validate your parking which is a nice bonus.
Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the exchange rates here are amazing.
I honestly do not think you can get currency for these prices anywhere, and you certainly cannot in nevada.
The fifth i would give it if was open later hours for sure!
This is an excellent small bank that treats their customers with respect.
My branch is bell rd and 7th st.
I highly recommend this branch.
The atmosphere was relaxed and i did not feel stressed or rushed.
Definitely like this credit union.
The tellers are always smiling & helpful and wait time even on a payday or friday is pretty quick.
I do like that this location is open until 7pm which is great for folks that work.
If you are in need of a bank/credit union you should give this place a chance.
Brad at e loans has been very pleasant to work with.
He does what he can to help.
I've had my lian with them for years and i can say he is responsive and straightforward.
I'm almost 82 years old and my husband recently passed away,leaving me trying to understand the finances.
I used to work at a bank and then you got all your interest from savings.
Mr juan hernandez was kind and wonderful.
I have dealt with him multiple times including setting up high school checking accounts for my teens.
He is always upbeat, genuine and expeditious.
He does a great job instructing the teens on banking issues.
No doubt there is too much paperwork involved in opening accounts anywhere, but justin makes it as painless as possible.
Remember to call ahead to make an appt.
I've been using this branch for many years without any issues.
The service has been consistent, professional, and efficient, as each time my transactions have not been straightforward or quick.
Thank you to all for your service & efficiency, much appreciated.
(the bank itself is conveniently located & clean, and the greeter was helpful & friendly)
After complaining about the terrible branch on tropicana and decatur.
Old bank but does the job and the lines are not as bad as the other reviews.
Nothing but a good experience here.
Jamieson was extremely helpful in setting up my account and my kids' accounts.
I am excited to be a new wells fargo customer.
And they always offer water.
I am so happy with this office!
I am glad i switched agents.
Mike is very knowledgeable and helpful.
The office is very professional and attentive.
They explain your coverage in detail and help find the best cost and coverage for you.
They also provided me with choices for a driving program for my teen daughter.
I highly recommend this office for your home or auto or mutual fund needs
I love this chase bank!
The tellers are so nice and detailed oriented.
Today i had the pleasure of dealing with tori what an incredible personality!
I felt like i was working with my life coach she was validating and made me feel awesome.
She handled the business professionally and flawlessly.
Tom her manager was just as awesome.
This is a great bank/credit union location just off the las vegas strip.
Great employees that are helpful and quick.
They have plenty of parking and easy to access.
The tobias team was absolutely wonderful during the process of me purchasing my first home!
From top to bottom everyone i worked was very accommodating through a very nerve racking process.
I would recommend them to all my friends and family!
Thanks again,  jason burton
Great service, easy parking in the underground garage, and the exchange rate was fair.
So far not impressed with our choice of a financial institution in nv.
Signed up online for a joint account, my document to sign came through fine, hubby's we had issues with.
In the meantime we have no access to our funds.
Tried to click to pay, doesn't work without an activated card.
What good is a bank that you can't get your money out of?
After posting my review i was contacted by vickie who was very apologetic and helpful.
Great customer service and thank you for your prompt attention and assistance.
Very friendly and accessible staff.
Easy to get in and out of with no super long waits.
This branch of wells fargo consistently provides me with the best banking experience i've had.
Kelvin and his staff are friendly and courteous and understand customer service.
Reminds me of how things used to be.
Good job kelvin, keep it up!
This is a great place to exchange money.
I have used them numerous times to change $ for whatever.
Every time i have found no commision and rates very close to those published on the internet.
I always call ahead just to make sure that they are carrying the currency that i am looking for.
They also gave me a bunch of small bills, perfect for travelling on vacation.
I've banked here less than a year, but i have had nothing but top rate service so far!
I originally applied for a checking and savings account online.
Then i applied for a credit card online.
Most of my direct dealings have been on the phone or using the drive-thru, but their customer service is excellent.
I stopped in here real quick yesterday.
Needed to get some spanish flash cards for my daughter.
Wow, i have never seen a barns n noble with two stories.
He was very friendly and helpful.
If i had time, i would have loved to browse longer.
I'm surprised by the low yelp reviews for this chase branch.
I've experienced nothing but positive service from this branch.
Fast, friendly service, and a personal salutation are the norm.
Truly enjoy utilizing this branch for my banking needs.
My fave bank location because of the merchant teller.
She is so nice and always knows me
This is the place for large amount exchanges!!!
Wells fargo does currency exchanges with no fees for their customers with their profit coming from their buy rate.
Their buy rate is very, very good compared to other banks.
We were looking to do yen to usd and they offered $1.20 per 100 yen.
Not bad at all.
I called fme and they offered $1.26 (5% more than wf).
One gripe, which others pointed out, is that they do exchange in front of everyone.
My teenager said "this is the best qt in the world!"
I love this store.
Favorite barnes and noble in town.
Two floors of books, music and gifts situated in a gorgeous outdoor mall!
I have to agree 100% with the previous poster, dawn.
I have only banked with this location for a couple of months, through my employer, and they are awesome.
Running to the bank is not a task, it's a joy, all because of this group of people.
Keep up the good work, guys and gals!
I be been with state farm for 8 plus years.
Same location 2 different reps. jodi by far the best ever!
Very caring, takes care of my needs in a timely fashion.
Takes care of all my policies including all of my life insurances.
For sure my next exchange will be with foreign money exchange...
Went in and there was a line.
Been to other ones in vegas and have to say i am impressed with this branch.
Will be coming here more often.
I was greeted by a lady.
She was really nice.
I exchanged dollars for japanese yen.
They asked for my for my address info and that was it.
I paid i cash.
I was in and out of the place in less than 5 minutes.
The only issue i had was i didn't know that i had to park in the convention garage.
I thought i had to pay, but they will validate the parking garage ticket.
So all is good.
All you gotta do is park, go up the elevators and you will find this small hidden gem.
Will be back for sure for any needs to exchange money.
This place is cheaper than my bank wells fargo.
Linda really helped me out with opening an account today.
She was prompt so i wasn't in there a long time like other banks.
She also explained to me the options i had about setting up different accounts to better my credit.
I will definitely go back to see her when i have any questions, or want to open any other accounts.
I regret that i forgot the name of the teller after i left.
She was very sweet.
If i ever decide to switch banks (which is always a possibility) this place is my first choice.
Also saturday hours, open until 4pm.
Flora helped me out great people go check them out.
If you are in need of some help go see them
The parking entrance isn't very visible from the street.
You have to turn into the curved driveway in front of the building.
It doesn't look like it, but there's an opening that leads into the underground parking lot.
Look for the signs directing you to the "tower" elevators.
When you exit the elevator, take the doors to your right to enter the "tower" building.
Go down the hall then make your first right.
Otherwise, you can enter through the front of the building.
If so, the place is on your left as soon as you enter.
Oh, don't forget to bring your parking ticket to get it validated at the shop.
The rates are pretty reasonable here.
Stopped in, told them what i wanted, filled out a short form, and receive my currency.
Straight forward and simple.
Went in the other day to take care of some work and grab a coffee in the cafe.
Kiki was such an awesome employee, very kind and helpful.
I recently had an issue with our account, i went in quite upset.
David helped me and did what was right, he took corrected the issue!
Thank you david for stepping up.
David also mentioned passing our information along to someone who can handle our accounts to offer a more personalized service.
That person, brandon has already called us.
The location is convenient and everyone is always pleasant.
I will miss karen.
I wish her the best.
Security guards do patrol the premises.
Despite the cons i noted about fme, from my experience they've always offered the best exchange rates in town.
I will never go back to a bank ever again.
Credit unions have won me over.
Uw credit union has won me over!
This location in particular is the best location throughout the madison and it's surrounding area.
As for the credit union itself, their are super fast!
I mean jimmy johns fast.
A few years ago, i needed to buy a car since my old one broke down on me.
I applied for a loan on a sunday night.
I kid you not... by 10am the next day, i was approved and the money was in my account.
I was blown away at how fast they work.
I am treated so much better as a customer.
She then helped me and directed me how to deposit using the atm outside under 100 degrees summer heat.
Good customer service brionne!
Thumbs up to midfirst bank.
We have our business account with them and there was some fraudulent activity.
They caught it before i did and acted immediately saving me what could have been a lot of money.
It just reaffirms our decision to move our business to this great bank.
Antonetta and nelson have been great to work with.
We first went to midfirst when looking to refinance our business loan.
Tom (at 64th & greenway) went above and beyond to pull off a complicated deal.
Now after this i am even more impressed with the bank and the staff.
I decided to convert over to chase from another well known bank, and i'm glad i did!
Frankie was the banker that helped me and he was so nice and friendly.
Ask for him if you go in!
Very happy with the customer service so far :).
I recently moved to las vegas to buy a home.
The management and staff at this branch were exceptionally friendly and helpful.
After only a few visits they greet me by name.
I needed to prove to a mortgage company that i had made a deposit in the bank of america.
It saved our deal.
Everyone was helpful and friendly at this branch.
They seemed to have a lot of regular customers who were greeted by name.
The manager hopped up to help my 94 year old mother when she came in with her walker.
All in all, a food experience.
I appreciate the roomy space that emitted positive vibrant energy, yet also made me feel quite at home.
It's a new style quiktrip, can't beat that!
It's like regular quiktrip but even better.
They have even more food choices including made to order smoothies, frozen yogurt and ice cream.
The bathrooms are super clean.
The store is super clean.
I needed a notary for some legs documents.
I walked across the street and found three at this bank.
They were very friendly and didn't charge me anything.
I actually got good service from a bank.
Gigi in accounts was very helpful and nice.
I got 2 accounts set up with no issues or problems.
Thank you chase bank.
Every time i come to chase they are very welcoming!
Due to good history with chase they waived a $30.00 fee.
Plus they have suckers and coffee!
What more can you ask for :)
The banker who helped us was very nice and friendly.
He even gave me a free stuffed chase dog haha.
They had a promotion where they'd give $125 after the first direct deposit to anyone opening a new chase checking.
Holy smokes, after my first direct deposit i had the $125 in like 2 days from chase!
This branch has drive up banking, which is very convenient, and everyone is always very friendly and helpful.
Totally loving chase and this location so far!
My experience with foreign money exchange was good.
I asked $500.00 or the closest to that amount so as not to get a weird amount.
They gave me pesos.
Really easy and professional.
Not rude at all.
Pretty good rate to boot.
My wife and i love wells fargo bank.
Very polite, knowledgable people, great hours, the kind of bank everyone hopes for.
My wife loves it so much, she got a job there!
Opened an account pretty quickly, no issues, very helpful staff and learned about a credit union to boot.
I'll update after a few months of use.
Best bank of america, ever!
We bank at a lot of locations; everyone here makes your business feel valued!!!
Thank you to karen and jessica, they are always friendly and helpful!
I love coming to this location!
This is my guy's bank.
I had some errands to run, so i went to complete a deposit for him.
From what i can see, there is only one drive up atm.
The other ones have the space tubes that go inside to a teller.
It was a short wait last night with the one car in front of me.
What i like about wells........ their deposit slot is not separate.
There is only one slot, located decently in the middle.
Located on commerce street, this is where the majority of culinary workers go to sign up for their benefits.
The workers were quick, efficient, and courteous.
Also, check their website as the deadline has been extended and there will also be longer hours.
One of the perks of my job is i get to do a lot of travel.
I love to try new restaurants whether they are mom and pops, fine dinining, chains or fast food.
They all have a place in my enormous belly.
One dirty little secret that i can now share with the world: i like gas station food.
Here is a new one to add, quiktrip.
We don't have them in california.
They put my favorite, am/pm, to shame.
It looks like they take great pride in their food.
I have visited a handful of qt's in my travels but just got water and fuel.
After a long day i was tired and ready to get food.
The country sausage dog is what you might think it is, sausage rolled like a hot dog on a bun.
If you like breakfast sausage you will love this treat.
I classed it up by dousing it in the cheese sauce.
The kolache was next level.
A spicy hot dog rolled in this sweet bread and baked.
It reminded me of being a kid and making hot dogs wrapped in the pillsbury crescent roll dough.
Ultimately, this place hits the mark.
Friendly, clean, tons of selection and fuel.
This place is a must for any road trip.
Can't speak highly enough about banker zack tribby!
He was helpful, professional, and a great sense of humor.
The people at midfirst really take care of you and make sure your needs are met.
My personal banker cabrina le, is always ready to answer my questions, and solve my problems.
Great store, great location near a large outdoor mall.
The employees are friendly and very helpful.
The selection of things to browse and purchase is exceptional.
This is the to go to place if you are in las vegas nevada and you need your money/currency exchanged.
The staff were very welcoming, friendly and helpful.
I parked in the building next to it underneath it has plenty of visitor parking.
$1.00 for the first 30 minutes which is all you need.
I would recommend going to this place over others.
Banks don't have certain currencies in stock and you have to order it a week in advance.
Not at this place.
It's available for same day service.
This is a small wittle bank.
The two tellers seemed nice.
My favorite part is that there was nobody there which surprised me given it's a saturday.
My only complaint is that i used the atm outside to deposit and it seriously took 15 minutes!
!which led me to use the actual humans inside.
Looks like i found my new bank
They follow the rules and take time to understand.
Banker alicia is a great person and very passionate banker.
She helped me with​ my banking issue very helpful way.
She finished the job during the conversation with her.
It didn't seem like i went to banker rather it felt like i was talking to my friend.
For her customer service,​ i will give 5 .
I called to see if they had a safety deposit box and what sizes.
I talked with dalton who was very helpful.
They had all sizes available except the largest one called a body box.
Also very reasonable annual fee.
This bank is huge with plenty of tellers to help you.
She offered assistance before she was even settled just so we wouldn't have to wait in line any longer.
She was so sweet and professional, which made the experience pleasant.
This branch always provides excellent customer service, thank you boa!
Darian, our personal banker had called to see if we needed to refi our car.
I scheduled w/ darian for that & also for mom to get help on her new account.
I can appreciate honest customer service.
He was helpful, kind, honest & professional.
After, i had to make a deposit.
The teller said she saw the birthday alert & just wanted to wish her a happy birthday.
The elderly lady left all smiles & happy.
I like all of the wells fargo's & their online & atm services, but this particular one is awesome.
Next time you're in there, be patient & enjoy good customer service that is hard to find.
This is a great branch of huntington bank.
There are 2 consistent tellers that know exactly what they are doing and are always friendly.
There is never a line for service.
I do attribute that to the fact the tellers are efficient andknow what they are doing.
I would bank at huntington bank only because of this branch and the service that i receive.
If you are looking for a great little downtown bank this is it!!
Sherryll is my bank lady, she's got a great personality and a strong handshake.
I trust her with all my business.
Amazing customer service at this location too.
I'm always around, i actually get my nails done in the same plaza too.
At chau's nail & spa so i'm being honest.
I've been banking here for over 2 years now, love it.
Super easy & friendly.....exchange my so fast,might have trouble finding the building
I always love my wells fargo banks and like this one mostly for it's convenient location.
Came in and was helped quickly, the teller was friendly and provided good service.
The bank was clean and had multiple tellers available for help.
Will be back again.
Been a member for many years.
Always willing to help you.
Online banking is easy to use.
I love all quick trips.
They have clean restrooms they can help two people at one time.
There ice is the coldest.
There bananas are yellow.
A great place to hang out.
Good selection of books and magazines.
They are very helpful locating books and will order for you if you don't find what you're looking for.
There's plenty of parking.
It's a good place to bring kids too as there is a good children's section.
Joanna morris was very helpful.
Now i am thrilled because of the educational services she provided.
Great service  dori the manager and her team are very professional and kindness!
Staff is always helpful and courteous.
They care about having my business.
Convenient location but it does not have a drive thru atm.
You can choose how you want your bills back, in $1,$5$10$or$20
Even bryce (the teller i usually speak with) joined in the effort.
By the way, this was by no fault of this branch but rather my california credit union.
Problem addressed and rectified.
I truly believe in professionalism and actually taking care of the client.
This trio, along with entire staff, has displayed courtesy and professionalism every time i've been in!
I think i am going to establish a new account with this bank.
Highly recommend this bank for all your financial needs.
Thank you again, wendi, laura and bryce.
Thank you george dammeir for being great at what you do and offering fantastic customer service!
I have been with state farm and joe janet's office for over 7 years now.
I actually signed with them after some terrible experiences with a local american family office.
I have to say that in all that time, i have always received friendly and attentive service from this office.
As good as it gets!
I love banks that are in old historical buildings!
I love to see how they incorporate the old with the new.
I assisted my client with his banking needs and the staff person was very nice and helpful.
After my bank turned me down (told me to go to the airport!
The customer behind me in line suggested foreign money exchange.
This is a wonderful place.
The women working there were patient and explained the system to me.
They didn't even seem to mind that i had a complicated order (ordering several currencies).
This was a very easy process.
And i highly recommend them.
This location itself is a little hidden, and the area is under construction.
But i didn't have any issues (and they validated my parking!)
I'm so grateful the guy behind me at the bank knew about this place.
I've said it before when reviewing other fcu branches, and i'll say it again:  banks suck!
First credit union is not a bank.
They report to no shareholders, no investors.
There's just the members (like me!).
Service is better, fewer (and smaller) fees, and a full-range of services.
The only down-side is fewer locations.
Fcu also financed my last car, and our home.
Come to a credit union.
I am happy with this one, but there are other cus to choose from (which you may qualify to join).
I can comment on the cafe most of all as this is my study hall area.
It's always clean and always cool and quiet.
The staff in the cafe is very friendly and let me know what the specials are.
They even ask me if i'm doing ok on my beverage too.
4 stars in my book.
The woman who helped me was so nice.
This company is an absolute pleasure to deal with.
They are professional, efficient and hassle free.
Banks take too long and make you jump through hoops to get financing.
Prudent is a much better alternative when you need a quick loan.
They know their clients by name and treat them with respect.
This is one of the few full service branches of citibank still left in vegas.
It has all the services but it will be busy most of the time.
Be sure to leave enough time if you are going to need assistance, especially on friday.
It open on saturday but i believe only till 2 pm.
And get there prompt because they will close those doors on time.
I have been a customer at this branch for 20 years.
That is a long time.
This was many years ago and george helped me with taking care of these issues.
He was concerned, compassionate and professional.
Toni marie has also helped with deposits and ira accounts.
All of the above are very personable and knowledgeable at their jobs.
I've had great experiences at this branch.
Both with the tellers and the sit down bankers.
I recommend coming to this branch if you bank with chase.
Whenever i'm over in the kannapolis/concord area, this branch is pretty convenient for me.
It's in a shopping center with harris teeter, along with several other smaller shops & services.
The tellers here are very nice & efficient, although generally, i use the drive thru atm.
There's plenty of parking & easy in/easy out access.
I have banked here for years and have been very happy with their services.
I have personal accounts and business accounts
I've been banking here since i was young.
The staff is so friendly, and extremely helpful!
Natalie and miguel are my two favorite employees at this branch!
The greenway location matt is awesome too!
Highly recommend banking with midfirst!
They make everything so easy on you!
Great bank, excellent location on the corner of scottsdale rd.
& frank lloyd wright blvd.
Went in an out of the branch in less than 5 minutes.
Security guard stand on-duty during normal bank hours.
Lots of parking spaces.
This bank is very close to my house.
But, i had never gone there.
Even though i have an acct here.
I don't know why!
But, know i have been here 3 times.
Both times have been really good.
Wells fargo always thanks you for your bussiness, which is really nice.
Lots of parking, as well as a drive through.
The tellers are very helpful and friendly.
I needed my last statement printed up.
No problem they did it in minutes and they did not charge me.
I am very happy with my customer service here every time.
Thank you wells fargo!
I had a great experience working with allison hilliard at goodmortgage.com.
She makes herself available to answer questions and made the process run smoothly.
My experience was hassle free and i recommend goodmortgage.com for competitive rates and superior customer service.
I bought a nook from this location a year and a half ago.
Today i had to return it for a third time, not barnes and nobles fault, for a new one.
I had james helping us because the nook people were fighting us for this return.
James spent over an hour and a half on the phone making sure we got the replacement we asked for.
He was awesome and i am very impressed with his dedication to the customer!
Christopher kidd is the best!
I had to come here in december when chase decided to cancel my credit card.
They wouldn't even let me talk to them on the phone and fix it that way.
So, 5 stars, chris.
I've used fme twice now, one trip for euros and the second trip for chinese yuan.
I will always exchange my money here before going on a trip, great rates!
I was in an out in about 5 minutes, make sure they validate your parking!
It's a credit union.
What more can i say?
Open an account for the benefits and diversify your funds.
Convenient and quiet location in downtown phx.
However, extremely easy to find.
When you drive to facility, park vehicle in underground parking under "visitor parking."
Take your ticket with you to be validated at foreign money exchange.
Enter the building marked tower not plaza.
As soon as you enter, foreign money exchange is on the left side.
I requested $100 worth of euros evenly divided between two people and staff complied.
I had to fill out a sales slip with my name and address.
You must pay in cash only.
I then had my parking ticket validated by staff placing a green sticker on it.
Otherwise, i will also use an atm while there.
Was in and out in under 5 minutes.
Would definitely return again.
I just want to take a moment to recognize eric f.  at your location.
The company i work for comes in weekly and can sometimes take a little longer to get in and out.
Eric was great and efficient.
He made sure that everything was organized and didn't rush which most people want to do.
Thank you eric for making a common visit great!!
Very nice location, customer service is very good.
Daisy the rep is very nice and knowledgeable.
There is a brand spanking new td canada trust in town and it is just off macleod trail.
So there is a lot of parking and hardly any line-ups.
I have been a client of td for over 15 years now and am extremely satisfied with banking there.
I have my car insured at td as well as an accident insurance plan established there.
They have also gifted me with my first credit card in 15 years.
Td was very quick to courier me a replacement card in 48 hours at no charge.
How can you beat this service?
Pam and everyone at the bank are very nice and provide great service.
Have been there for 15 years and never have had any issues with the service.
I really do love my bank, as strange as that sounds.
Td canada trust offers customers great banking solutions  during hours that actually work for them.
This is always incredible to me.
Additionally, when i was recently visiting nyc, td had banks everywhere.
I'm not even kidding--i must've seen at least five around midtown manhattan.
When they say they are everywhere, they really aren't kidding.
Amador in the business services dept was very helpful and easy to get along with.
All of my mortgage and personal services were handled professionally.
Ladies are wonderful and gives you awesome advices.
Validated my parking stub too.
Tip: we found place easily by reading other comments on here.
Rates are awesome and worth the trip.
I don't really have anything bad to say about this branch.
Sometimes the wait here is a little long as they don't seem to operate with alot of tellers.
I have used a bunch of their services including the 24 hours atm and notary.
It's very convenient being so close to where i live.
It's convenient to have so many other stores close by.
Shelly has taken care of my mortgage needs for several years.
Both times very easy, fast, and convenient.
I'm going again this week and expect that i will have the same pleasant experience.
Thanks for making the process so easy!
Came here as another location (desert inn and durango) didn't have the sufficient staff to provide the service...
This was previously a washington mutual location before it turned into a chase.
It has quite the .... different design than a normal bank....
After going through those doors, you have a huge wall leading you into a huge room.
Bankers to the left, tellers to the right.
According to the banker who helped me, this was the design of the previous wamu.
She described it as like a huge living room.
Process was seamless and quick.
Banker stated card will arrive in about a week in a non-labeled white envelope.
Exchanged us for canadian currency today.
No fee,  and the % was only .01 more than my phone reported.
My parking stub was validated and the transfer was fast and efficient.
How easy is that!
No bank is perfect.
They all are problematic & have issues.
The trick is finding a bank whose issues you can live with.
I opened my account in henderson but for some reason this location is my "home branch."
I live in silverado ranch near the mccarran center, but ok...whatever.
My office isn't far from this one.
She has always been helpful & responsive with whatever i need.
I was in yesterday and was finally able to meet her.
Definitely makes my life easier & i appreciate her help when i need it.
Wish the atm was drive thru here.
Its a matter of grocery shopping or going out with friends this interferes with.
The 2 hours makes a difference.
I just wanted to thank zack for always being excited to help me .
He has good advice and is an asset to wells fargo.
All the tellers are great .
Especially kacie she always makes you feel important and makes you feel good about yourself.
John the manager is great also.
I was with a different bank and they don't have locations across the us when i travel .
Wells fargo is everywhere .
Other banks draw you in with promotions and freebies .
Then you can never find a branch .
Wells fargo will offer you a cold water but way better banking .
Been with state farm over 50 years.
Whenever needed state farm has been there for me.
Moved here to las vegas in august, transferred policy to mark citsay office.
Was impressed with staff and quick response.
In september, i was quickly introduced to las vegas traffic.
My vehicle was rear ended and totaled on the summerlin freeway.
Marks office staff was immediately on it and quickly got me taken care of.
I highly recommend mark citsay and his staff.
Stay away from the wall street mega banks and put your money into a community bank like midfirst.
It's only appropriate and about time i did a review for my all time favorite banking facility.
Let me begin by saying that over the last ten years!
I've had the life experience of having a bank account at basically everywhere.
From credit unions, to state banks, to other national banks!
Time and time again!
I always come back to wells fargo.
I've gotten credit cards, car loans, countless checking and savings accounts, insurance!!
By far the best customer service, always understanding, and i have had overdrafts which i have gotten reversed!
I've never really had any major or even minor issues with them.
I have just reached my 10th year anniversary with them as a my bank, and i couldn't be happier!
I'm on this stage coach for good!
Never thought i would be writing a review on a bank, but great service must be recognized.
Wf employee brandi was efficient in assisting me and even reminded me of the need to renew my driver's license.
I did not realize it needed to be renewed.
Thank you brandi for your help!
My daughter and i received exceptional customer service.
She was looking for some new reads and elizabeth was amazing!!
She listened to her interests and made suggestions based on that.
We bought more books than we came in for and my daughter loves all of them.
Always nice to come here.
Every one is so nice.
No one likes to go bank after work but it's not bad at all for me to swing by here.
Right off the 303 in the albertsons shopping center.
I used to bank with chase right after the wamu merger.
I was not impressed.
That all changed recently when i opened a new account.
They don't have a fee for exchange!
The customer service is excellent!
Don't forget to have your parking validated.
We inherited some jewelry from my stepmother and needed to sell it.
The pieces we sold to biltmore were two rings, neither of which were especially fashionable in today's market.
Two other buyers had given us prices which only recognized the scrap value of the gold and platinum settings.
Did we get what the rings would sell for to an interested private individual?
Heck no, but it could have taken us years to find such a buyer.
I have really enjoyed banking at chase and think their customer service is great.
I can honestly say these two people i point out here could easily be cool and good friends.
Plus this place is convenient - atm is never packed and you're always in and out.
Not to mention he made the process very time efficient.
Dinorah was excellent, she processed my wire transfer quickly and was very nice.
She also helped me order a replacement atm card.
I truly enjoyed my experience at this bank.
My uncle asked me to help him with an estate that was left to him.
I cannot tell you enough how glad i was to work with biltmore loan.
Many of the items were rare... many were junk:).
We were glad to have their help.
Some of the things they just told us to put up on ebay.
Others they had ideas for getting top dollar.
I ran them over just to see what they would offer.
Some of the items were stamped silver.
They made a $300 offer for the lot.
Toni, and her office, have been wonderful to work with.
Toni got back to us quickly, understood our needs, and was tremendously easy to work with.
It's been the best insurance experience we've ever had.
I highly recommend her to everyone (by which i mean i actually recommend her to everyone who asks).
Found this place thanks to yelp.
Lady at the desk was very nice.
I didn't know if i was being charged a fee or not.
Which it really didn't matter, since i just wanted to change my extra pesos for dollars.
The place is a bit hidden.
So i will know next time i come back.
Best private bank in the state of arizona.
I enjoyed their fast and friendly staffs.
In and out of the bank in less than 5 minutes.
They also offer nationwide free atm service, it's a must if you travel a lot like me.
And they are the home bank for arizona state university sun devils!
Was a member of wamu until chase bought them out.
They let me keep my free checking/checks that i had from the wamu days.
Have had no issues.
Always friendly and helpful service.
They have a great exchange rate.
It's clean inside and the lady at the front desk was professional and kind.
Always a friendly staff and clean store.
My family always had state farm insurance at hawaii.
They've always pushed me to get state farm too.
But it would always look for those cheap insurance out there.
But last, i decided to give it a try.
They also have life insurance.
Anyways i love that they have a 24hr assistance that you may call.
I've had to call them twice with no hassle.
They're always there in my time of need.
Oh and is a live person you talk too.
So ya....i love my experience with them.
Foreign money exchange is literally the only good currency exchange in las vegas.
They'll rip you off.
They'll rip you off then rip your heart with their terrible exchange rates.
If you're coming from las vegas blvd, it'll be in the complex after the royal resort.
Park in the underground garage.
Take the elevator to the first floor, it'll be on your right side.
Walk in with your cash money.
Validate your parking pass.
Walk out with your foreign cash money.
Went to go exchange usd to cad.
The rate right now is about .77, i got mine exchange for .785.
This is actually pretty good considering the fact that they don't have any additional fees.
The person that helped me was quick and efficient.
I was in there for about 5 minutes top.
She validated my parking without even asking me or me having to ask her first.
Definitely a go-to place if you ever need to exchange any money.
Amazing customer service and they took care of me and my account.
I dealt with luis and it was a pleasant experience through and through.
This place is awesome.
I traded us dollars to canadian, the ladies were friendly and knowledgeable.
Parking is crazy but they validate.
The agent looked at my record and took immediate action... then promised a 30 minute call back.
I am beyond happy with my new policy and the wonderful customer service i received from her office!
As great as their reviews suggest.
Fast, friendly, and extremely knowledgeable.
Exchanged some us dollars for mexican pesos.
Garage is well lit and plenty of spaces close to elevator.
Get your ticket validated for free parking.
Great exchange rates to boot.
I came into this bank for some coin rolls.
It was a quick and easy tranaction.
The woman had a broken leg and still got up to get the coin rolls while still cracking jokes.
Overall i would definitely come back to this place.
Visited for 2nd time today to convert usd to foreign cash.
Helpful, friendly and quick.
Also, this place is 4% cheaper than my bank.
Great service - check better pricing - checkmate.
Marissa is a life saver!
I was about a few minutes late but marissa took the time to help me get a blank check anyway!
We needed to exchange some dollars for yen and found this place here on yelp.
I called them in the morning to find out more about the process and they were very helpful.
They had what i needed on hand and had it waiting for me when i arrived there an hour later.
Such a smooth process, in and out in about five minutes or so.
This is the place if you're looking to a hassle free money conversion.
Atm will never accept my checks for a deposit.. so i use the drive through teller.
Tip - if you bank at chase, cashiers check are free.
I don't know if you have to have a minimum balance or anything like that.
I have been broke - and gotten them for free so i would guess not.
I went in to the eastern branch today and was helped right away.
Teresa was well informed and helpful.
Thanks one nevada !!
I am a current wells fargo customer- and i just wanted to stop in an open an additional savings account.
I had a very pleasant and easy experience.
#nodapl was my reason for switching from my big bank financial institution over to a credit union.
I started my new account application online and finished it at my local branch.
Linda was the representative that wound up setting up my new accounts and she could not have been nicer!
She talked me through everything and all of the services available to me!
The process was speedy and thorough.
I have been with state farm ulyanna's office for approximately ten years.
The office does a great job of handling issues.
I found them to be very professional and reliable.
Apparently they aren't in the business much anymore, if at all... my daughter enjoyed the memorabilia on the walls...
I would recommend fme to anyone with foreign currency needs...
The gals are sweethearts and will treat you very well...and even validated our parking!
Great service and super friendly staff.
Mike and his team are incredibly professional and cover a wide range of services.
I would definitely recommend him to all your insurance needs!
We need these in cali!!!
The best service i have ever had at a cibc.
The staff here makes a conscious effort to go above and beyond when it comes to customer service.
They truly shine in this area; their level of customer service is exceptional.
I've never had a problem here and i've always left with a smile on my face.
Quick and easy currency conversion and better rates than the banks.
We were in and out in under 10 minutes.
I do believe i will enjoy doing business with this branch in henderson
The culinary workers local no 226 is one of the biggest and best unions in town.
The actual building the union is housed in is very crammed and in dire need of a touch up.
If you need an insurance office in the northeast cleveland suburbs, i highly recommend her organization.
I recently opened my account with one nevada and it has been a great experience so far.
He was very professional and polite throughout the whole process.
I recommend that if you are looking to open and account, you go to him.
People need to know about this place!!
I don't do many reviews but since i had such a great experience here i want to let others know.
My first impression was how genuinely warm and welcoming everyone was.
They treated me like i was a person and not an opportunity that made the difference for me.
I cannot say enough good things about these guys and i highly recommend them.
If you need to pawn or sell your jewelry or collectibles, check them out for yourself!
So we pop in just before 5pm.
This branch is amazing with amazing people.
The issue was resolved at a timely manner.
Thank you for having a solid line of communication.
Please reference my revised review.
I don't do any personal banking here but needed help with a transaction involving a wells fargo account.
Nikkeeta sissom was definitely on top of her game.
Efficient, knowledgeable, & very professional.
I would highly recommend her to anyone who has (or wants) a wells fargo account.
Was very happy on how efficient they are.
Not sure why a previous review complained about the collections attorney they use.
What does that have to do with anything?
Will definitely return if i have to exchange foreign currency back to us dollars!
Exchange rate excellent, saved me a lot of $ in lieu of buying from my bank!
Great  bank, staff always kind and helpful.
Needed a document notarized and i got done with ahalya shenthan, sweet person.
Right on campus so parking sucks.
I had to use a meter outside and was in and out close to 5pm so i cant complain.
Ok, so it's only been twice.
Both times i went to this branch, the employees that helped me were extremely helpful and kind.
And they had me back out the door with my issues resolved within 10 minutes.
I'm new to this bank.
This location is clean, location is great and the staff is very helpful.
This bank is so huge!!!
It has like 7-8 bank machines.
Even if the line is 10 deep, you'll usually get a machine within two minutes.
So yeah, this bank is cool.
They have a variety of beverages to offer customers and sometimes have treats available.
I would recommend mike millers office out of any other agent in arizona or surrounding areas!
I highly recommend switching your insurance needs over to this office you wont be disappointed.
Mark and jodi are amazing!!
Always a quick turnaround, very responsive, professional and provide the most exceptional cost-saving service.
I use them for all my insurance needs here in vegas and ca.
I can honestly say i will never use another team.
Not only do i value our professional relationship but they have become life-long friends as well.
Thank you state farm team for all you do and have done for me and my family.
I have been coming to this location for about 1 and half years now.
It is always easy to deal with.
2 entrances, one on rural and the other on baseline.
For a while they were not putting out deposit or withdrawal slips for some reason.
The girl said that the manager wanted everyone to use the debt card.
I am guessing that others felt the same way and so they brought them back.
Which is what i like.
They always greet you when you come in.
The staff is very pleasant, and they even have a drive thru.
I like the location,it has proven to be easy to get to as well.
Plus , they have an atm outside.
Pros: this wf bank is pretty good.
It's basically as good as it gets.
They provide most of the bank services here and have 1 atm in the drive-thru!
The employees are kind and respectful.
Con: there is usually a line in the afternoons, especially on weekends.
The area in which it is located is slowly becoming a shady place during the nighttime.
This branch of wells fargo is my favorite.
For the most part because of a banker there named morris richie.
I have multilpe accounts and multiple questions.
Morris is so friendly and helpful it is unbelieveable.
No matter what banking problem i have, morris solves it.
I feel like he is my friend rather than my banker.
I go out of my way to use this bank.
What a great bank!
Excellent service and services, excellent banking plans, lovely people.
This bank treats you like a customer, not just a 'consumer.'
Kiimberly saxburg could not have been nicer, more efficient, more careful and more knowlegeable.
I'm all for regional banks and midfirst is one of the best ever.
They give you coffee and, like, candy while you do business.
And - wait for it - you'll get a hand-written note from them after you open an account.
There's everything to like about midfirst.
Run, do not walk, to move your banking business there.
We are grateful flagstar saw us differently.
This the best bank i have ever dealt with.
The staff are so nice.
I can't resist to come back to them.
This location was opened in early july, 2008, a new location in highway 101.
I don't know about the rest of amtrust bank branches, but this one is the best one ever.
Anita is the senior personal banker at the location.
I have dealt with her few years before she moved from the old location to the new location.
Told her i say so.
I exchanged dollars to euros.
The exchange rate was 1.155 dollars for 1 euro, yahoo was 1.135.
They were only 2% higher.
Bank of america wanted 4% higher.
Important - they moved to the new tower on the opposite side of the building.
I was a little confused when i went to their old office.
There was no signs at the old office or directions to the new office.
This is a very nice wells fargo.
It is nice and big when you walk in and there are plenty of friendly tellers helping customers without hesitation.
This location is near several popular places and also in the same parking lot as a bank of america.
The que usually moves quickly and the attendants are capable and motivated!
They've dug me out of a tough time or two with their positivity and great customer service!
Sincerely going above and beyond at this finely mannered branch.
I recently opened a checking, savings and cd with the am trust bank on rae road in chandler.
The staff at this branch were extraordinary!
Assistant branch manager, maryann myers, personally handled the set up of my new accounts.
She was knowledgeable, patient and has been following up via telephone.
I even had the opportunity to meet and talk with branch manager, calvin coleman who was also very helpful.
The teller staff even remember my name when i visit the branch!
Absolutely the best service i have ever received in opening a new banking relationship!
Went in to this branch to convert a regular checking account in to a trust.
I waited no longer than 15 minutes and was approached by nataly to inquire why we were in the bank.
Customer service is key at this branch.
Even as we first sat down to wait, a manager approached us with bottled water.
We have been with this bank/branch for many years and for good reason.
The office staff were sweet, personable, and very efficient.
We needed euros and received the currency immediately and with no fees on top of current exchange rate.
What a super service to have and without ordering and having to wait for shipment!
Thank you so much!
We will share this service and location with others and we highly recommend this place.
The interior is quite nicely decorated and historical.
Easy review, very simple.
Tough to say a whole lot about a simple deposit at a non-peak time.
They always seem to be efficient when i come in.
Crazy how much money people have.
He needs to fight pacquiao soon so he can buy another couple cars and flaunt his riches to us commoners.
4 stars, solid bank in my opinion
The consultants take their job seriously.
They authentic everything so do not expect to walk away with a deal that day.
They really do their research which is cool.
Everything is very confidential so your privacy means a lot to them.
High security too a lot of cameras and you have to be buzzed in and out of the entrance door.
Great service and they charge so much less than all the other exchanges.
Mine worked out to be about 3% for euros and british pounds.
Much less than the rates in the mall and nice ladies working there.
The best place to exchange your currency in las vegas!
Avoid travelex, banks, and hotels.
This place gives you the best rates hands down.
I had read the loan terms and disclosures on their website prior to submitting the application.
When i spoke with brad, he thoroughly walked me through their fees, rates, and terms.
Everything he mentioned aligned with what was published on the website.
I felt comfortable proceeding and we closed the loan within 10 days.
If you're looking for alternative financing for your quick project, i would highly recommend working with brad and amber!
I came in to sign up for a new bank account.
I have always heard great things about chase and they were confirmed with my visit.
I called in to see how long it would take to get mexican pesos.
The lady said it's always good to call in 2 weeks advanced.
When i finally put my order in, my currency came in sooner than expected.
The location can be a bit of a challenge to get to as they're doing construction.
The parking garage is directly across the street from the somerset shopping sign.
Then walk out where you drove in and you will see the tower building in front of you.
It's a shorter walk than going through the garage and going up the elevators.
Don't forget your parking garage ticket so they can validate.
The lady was friendly and gave a receipt breaking down my transaction.
She even exchanged my random australian money i had.
Very easy and would go again.
Great place both to buy and sell.
Hope they consider opening up on weekends.
This place is great.
Mario helped me out and he was very nice and friendly.
Everyone there was really nice, the place is welcoming and i got good money for my jewelry.
I really recommend this place.
I was greeted and taken care of right away great customer service.
The best chase i've been to hands down.
Usually hate going to the bank, but this visit was enjoyable!
It was my first time at this specific location, and rey was very nice and helpful.
She also explained things to me very thoroughly in terms so i can understand.
You can pull up immediately and thereby having less wait.
The other locations in my area usually only have one and it can get pretty bottle necked.
Now the one downfall is all of the construction that has been going on for months.
Not the banks fault though so i won't consider that in my review but it is super annoying.
I go to the foreign money exchange for every trip i've taken over seas.
They have the currency readily available, the service is quick, and the employees are always very kind!
They validate my parking and i'm generally in and out in less than 20 minutes.
Why go anywhere else?
Yes, the line inside is long.
Actually, i don't think we've ever been when there wasn't a line.
C.  pretty friendly staff.
At least you don't feel like a burden even if there is a swarm waiting behind you.
So overall, yes, the line is long.
Yes we could drive a little further for a different bofa.
But in all honesty, we've just gotten used to this one.
So yeah, we'll always be here as long as we're in vegas.
Great service at this location - very friendly - you get in and out very quickly :)
Collin wolfson the account manager is really knowledgeable and helpful.
He has assisted me in many ways and all in all it was a win, win for both of us.
Highly recommend this agency and collin
Lucia has excellent customer service, smiling  and asking how she can help me.
Great customer service here.
And as i stated earlier lucia was great!
The young lady next to her, chae, was awesome as well.
While lucia was helping me, chae was asking me how my day was, and small chit chat.
If i'm in this neighborhood again, this will be my go to chase.
Thank you ladies for a great hassle free experience!
If you need any 1on 1 help khaseem j. everett  is the representative to ask for!
Very professional, very attentive, definitely will wait on line to see this guy for any of my banking needs!
Great online and mobile app for my everyday banking needs.
My girlfriend and i went in rather late before they closed to close an old account of hers.
Ended up lasting almost 45 mins after they closed.
Mind you this was to close an account too so they were technically losing a customer.
I'm not easily impressed with the service of banks but this really stood out.
I wasn't surprised to see some awards for this branch and this manager around the place.
Nice people and great rate.
If you park in the garage they validate your ticket so you're not charged for parking.
I have been coming to this branch for years.
I am always helped right away.
First floor of plaza building.
Google said 39 they charged 41, much better than the banks.
I'm so happy i found this place!
They're friendly and no hassle at all!
They also validated my parking which was super nice!
You got most here than you would at a bank or the airport!
I'd call ahead to make sure they have the currency you need in case you need a lot of them.
From now on, i'll only go to this place for any currency exchange.
Most convenient for me so i'm here often.
Always a smooth transaction.
They have a drive through atm and one at the door.
Ps: apparently they don't like 3 wolf moon t-shirts.
Best bank i have ever been into.
Everyone who works there is always so nice.
This is my favorite bank of all time.
I keep reminding myself to switch my other accounts to this bank as well.
I feel like the other banks keep nickel & diming me.
I love this place.
I was on vacation in las vegas.
But i hit the jackpot with choosing this foreign money exchange ....
The lady behind the counter patiently answered my questions.
I am glad that i went there.
It just made a very happy start for my big trip.
There were no hidden fees.
And the exchange rates were very fair.
I highly recommend this place.
I exchanged a total of  $1,500 u.s. into the foreign money.
So, don't be alarmed if you are asked to give your social security number.
Called before i went and the lady (i think it was elizabeth) on the phone gladly answered all my questions.
They only take cash for currency exchange.
They had my currency available and the exchange rate was waaaaay better than the bank!
As the other reviews mentioned, parking is underground.
The place was easy to find, its right at the entrance/lobby of the building.
But if you're coming in from the garage, your entry is on the side of the building.
Keep going in until you see the lobby and its right there on your right.
This will be my go to place for forex transactions.
I like this new store.
They need to get the 44oz and 52 oz in styrofoam, and lower the pricing to the same as plastic.
Circle k has 44 oz styro everyday.
I get my cups there, refill them at qt.
Or bring my 52 oz qt cups back for refills.
Fast service as expected, same as in other qts.
Sometimes there's only 1 cashier when there's a line.
They are sometimes a little slow getting additional cashiers up there.
The staff is friendly and helpful.
The hours are great as i sometimes work odd hours.
Some off the tellers have heavy foreign accents so be sure to listen closely to what they are saying.
I opened an account and will keep going back.
I took my wedding ring in which i was looking to sell to biltmore.
I was treated with such respect and professionalism.
Usual bank business, not as busy since it's in "southern islands" ha haa
We just visited this pawn shop and got 17 dvds for only $1 each!
The staff was all nice an friendly...
Parking was a bit tight, but a good place!
The tellers are very nice.
Service is usually slow but very friendly.
Lines can be long.
I had to stand in line to get checked in and then wait again for service.
Also seems like they need more help.
Maybe they don't need more staff but just to expedite the processes their using.
Friendly is good until it's so friendly it makes me late back to work.
I read the reviews & went over to open an account yesterday.
I am so angry with bank of america that i have been with for the past five years.
Then they bounced a check i wrote off the funds they said they transferred & charged me another $35!
That is not the way to treat someone who has an 850 credit score.
But in fairness, that is probably because mercury is in retrograde & everyone is having problems!
I was out in 3 minutes with everything i needed.
This branch is always there for for me and i always leave with a smile.
Great job wheels fargo!
This is a nice b&n location.
It's quiet and well maintained.
The staff is friendly and helpful but not overbearing, which means a lot to me.
My younger kids enjoy the children's section and i can't complain about any place that encourages more reading!
This office is great to work with.
The prices are good, and the service to get any information you may need along the way is great.
It was such a pleasure working with the chandler location staff.
Jessy was informative, genuine and truly authentic.
I was greeted by a friendly, warm and kind woman at the front desk.
I am truly impressed and satisfied by the professionalism, kindness and knowledge jessy demonstrated.
I would highly recommend them to anyone and would be more than happy to be a returning customer.
Boa was such a gentle, warm and calm dog.
It was a pleasure meeting him and he made my overall experience just that much better.
Thank you chandler staff!
You are truly amazing.
They are very attentive and they are always ready to help you solve any problems you may encounter.
A service up to my expectations!
This is the best location i've been to in a long time.
Tellers and bankers were all very helpful
Ran it at 6:45 on a friday night to deposit a check and they were fast, friendly and efficient.
Didn't have to wait in long lines!
Jordan thomson is the best banker i have ever encountered!!!
He went over and beyond the call of duty to assist me...
I'm forever grateful and will remain a bank of america customer because of him
Edgar has helped me several times at this location.
He has always been pleasant, knowledgeable, efficient and patient.
What a piece of cake...  can't imagine a better, easier way to exchange currency.
The transaction took perhaps three minutes max and i was out of there.
I couldn't recommend more highly, and i will certainly return if i need foreign currency in the future.
But, i returned today & walked in to a line to door.
My natural response was "my meter is going to expire" & irritation ensued...
I made sure to tell him that he & his team did very well working through the line.
Esther was super helpful and nice and im so happy i came here.
They do 2nd chance banking with helps someone like me get back on my feet.
Love this place and love esther
Good people constantly working hard for our clients.
Please give us a try!
What can i say about toni that isn't good.
Let me start by giving you a back story.
In 1995 i moved to las vegas and was forced to change agents because i was in a different state.
I moved back to cleveland in 2011 and the first person i called was toni to get my car insurance.
Guess what, ...  she remembered me after 16 years.
If you're looking for an insurance agent, then call toni, you wont be disappointed.
This was was located on convention drive between paradise and las vegas blvd near the ross.
Kinda far from where i love.
I live in henderson but oh well it's the only place that gives good rates on foreign currencies.
This place is great if you ever need to change dollars to whatever currencies.
It beats waiting in the banks for your money to come and they will not rip you off.
This place is by far the best when it comes to exchange rates.
I have been coming here since for about 12 years now at least once or twice a year.
It was easy to find!
And don't forget to validate your ticket!!!
Chase is a pretty good bank overall.
The bankers treat you really well and are professional and courteous.
Generally there isn't a long waiting line so you can get through quickly.
Love their app that even lets you deposit checks without going to the bank.
I completely forgot to write a review back in november when i came in!
Hassle-free, kind staff, and a good exchange rate.
I'd definitely use them again!
The best agent ever!
I've been with her and lisa over 20years!
They are compassionate, straight forward and generally care about you!
Always available even on weekends and outside of business hours!
They helped me with all my needs, and quickly!
There is no reason to look any further for insurance, this is the agent you need!!
I have to call agents often to get the management company added and it is usually a hassle.
Whoever answered the phone was extremely professional and pleasant.
Thank you for your help from one professional to another!
I went to the bank around closing to deposit a large check.
Little did i know that the amount was over the acceptable limit for immediate deposit.
I made the mistake of using a computer to do my banking, atms, who needs them?
When i realized my error, i went inside to speak with a teller.
She was very patient, very kind.
And after trying to resolve the issue herself, she called over linda, the branch manager.
It took but two minutes to turn my frown upside down.
What an incredible team!
Come to find out, bundling my car insurance saved me about $55 a month!
And the homeowners insurance was surely the least expensive quote i got, by a long shot.
It's always a nice surprise when you are able to save money when switching.
This office is certainty the best around.
Thank you roxanna for all of your help, you have truly made a difference!
Came to this branch to pay off a car and get the title.
Everything was fast and efficient.
National chain stores, big box stores and the like.
That being said, it is at times persuasively difficult to assuage the obvious convenience.
So on with the review!
Or more specifically, the person being reviewed.
Her name is margaret (maggie) flanagan, and she is a personal banker at this branch.
On first impression, she is warm, inviting and personable.
Subsequent visits confirm legitimacy and add genuineness.
She is a good fit for her position.
She is worth the drive or call in order to navigate other than superficial banking needs.
4 stars due to my obvious bias with her community destroying affiliation with big business.
I was frustrated the week before christmas when i was shorted on a transaction to exchange cash for coins.
I didn't open all the coin rolls at the bank, but i did when i got home later that day.
I realized i was shorted, but i didn't have time to go into the bank until just today...
So convenient for my deposits after a long day at the salon.
It's nice that it's in fry's too because i can grab some groceries before i head out.
The associates are always friendly and ready to help as well.
I will definitely go back there
This is where i always go to make my foreign currency exchange.
They manipulate they exchange rate slightly which is how they make a living.
They do not charge a fee on top of that like other exchange places.
At current rates june /2017 it cost me about $10 to exchange $500 us to pounds.
And about the same or less for euros.
Which seems pretty fare considering that plus a fee if i use my debit card.
The employees here are super helpful.
They exchange has moved from suite 122 into the tower and suite 101.
I'll post a photo.
They have a covered parking garage below and they validate your parking in the exchange with a stamp.
If you plan on doing over $1000 make sure you bring your passport or are prepared to give your soc.
Number for internal audit info.
But transaction below that simply give your name and address.
Best place in town or anywhere i've exchanged.
Outside of signing loan papers or robbing it, when was the last time that you ventured into a bank branch?
My home branch is in gananoque (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/cibc-gananoque).
I've not moved it since i moved to toronto as i didn't really feel the need.
As for driving back to gananoque for the sake of a four number code, i thought better of it.
Well, this was the first place i happened on.
Because of its location, i can understand why they have so many bank machines available and a large teller space.
I went in at mid-day to get my credit card sorted out and they took care of me instantly.
There was no wait, no line-up, just in, up to the counter, and talk to a teller.
That's even faster than the internet.
I had fraudulent charges on my account two days before i was set to leave town.
He was very helpful and told me all my options.
He was very polite and was a joy to talk to.
I've banked at other banks before but he made me feel welcome and talked to me like an actual person.
Not like another banker who hates his job.
He also told me about promotions and offers!
Not pushy at all.
I am so proud to be a wells fargo customer.
The people here are always so friendly and helpful and are always smiling!
On top of that, recently one banker made the greatest impression on me.
His name is brandon garcia.
I recently flew my retired mother to vegas for a visit.
Naturally, i took her to my chase branch in my neighborhood where we were greeted by brandon.
The checks cost somewhere in the neighborhood of $18.
I wanted to pay this fee for her.
Unfortunately, this has to be debited directly out of her account.
So i just told my mom i would give her the money for her to apply to her account.
Let me tell you, i was wildly impressed by this unsolicited act of kindness!
Class move by mr garcia!
I think i need to make this my primary bank!
...after all, they hooked mama up!
Been banking with chase bank for like forever.
Enjoyed their fast service and friendly staffs.
Great location just off loop-202 & us-60 and within minutes from arizona state university (asu) & mesa community college (mcc).
I feel like i'm treated like family.
Quinn l. has been working hard on behalf of my family.
I think the coverage is excellent for the price and i have no desire to shop around.
Give this agency a call for quote.
They know what they are doing!
Great location, great service, everyone is very friendly and helpful.
It's my go to branch for all my simple easy to do banking needs.
Their drive thru is highly convenient and easy to use with the tellers ready to assist.
I receive fine service every time i come here.
The employees are mainly hispanic as noted in a previous review, but this is a hispanic neighborhood.
There is no language barrier and i am always treated with the utmost care when i bank here.
Joe has been my insurance agent sine he first opened his office in my neighborhood.
His office staff has always been fantastic.
They arranged for a tow truck to take my car away.
They even set up which repair facility would handle the repairs.
"i would highly recommend joe janet to be your state farm agent"
This location is right next to my work and is incredibly convenient.
I have been a member of this bank for 6+ years after converting from satan's lair (bofa).
They are incredible as a banking establishment.
I have been very happy with this company as a whole.
They're knowledgeable, nice and do not take me for all that i have (low standards from my abuse at bofa).
I am loyal and will stay until i potentially move from the state.
Thank you kim for all your help and thank you state farm
The customer service at this branch is phenomenal.
My husband i are always treated exceptionally well.
It is a lot of small touches that make this bank a standout.
The staff is personable, the atmosphere inviting and a complimentary water and coin machine are an added bonus.
Even the safe deposit box area feels better than most banks.
I would highly recommend this particular branch of midfirst bank!
Rare an beautiful personal touch.
It is rare to have a personal touch at banks today.
Nela and jessica have gone out of their way to make this stressful transition to parenting the parent easy.
I am most grateful.
Justin barcom has so much positive energy.
Every major bank claims to have a personal banker.
This is usually a complete joke.
Justin will move up fast so enjoy it while you got it.
He will actually try to help you and make things easier.
This is out branch of choice in henderson.
Prompt, friendly, accurate, helpful....everything the branch on eastern and st rose is not.
And of course i always speak softly to quietly protest...get it, quietly protest?
I came in today for a quick bit of banking.
They were fast and helpful as always.
Today being saturday they had chilled water and coffee and wonderful cookies.
Always a great place to stop and it is on the way to any where i have to go.
This place is awesome.
I've just refinanced with third federal - thanks wendy and christine.
I was somewhat apprehensive, as they were offering the lowest rate available at the time, but everything went very smoothly.
They were up-front about their fees (not too high), and everything progressed at a reasonably good pace.
Our ltv was ~25%, and credit scores very high, so that probably helped.
Somewhat unexpectedly, we received a $100 home depot gift card from them today - a nice touch.
Lots of hate on here, however i get mad at the branch at decatur and trop.
That place is a mad house and you will wait forever.
This however is a different story.
I waited about 10 min, no big deal.
I met with michelle b who is a personal banker.
She was very professional and courteous.
Very funny and seemed to genuinely care about my frustrations.
Got me my card fast and explained everything with every detail.
She also noticed that my signature was not matching my cards so she helped me with that as well.
I was helped by katya, who was very pleasant and friendly.
I'm glad i stopped i just wish it wasn't so far from my house!
Today is the last day and the cashiers office at school closes in 10 min!!
Apparently the line wasn't long before i arrived but when i got into the branch it was pretty lengthy lookin'.
I wish i could remember his name!!
My five stars goes to him :)
I have been using this office since i moved to vegas in 2014.
Sf is great, but this office is the best!
I came here to use the cash machine and it worked great.
I did the drive thru and i got my cash and left.
Not much else to say.
Not sure why that other guy is so mad.
Guess my rating will bump it up a little :)
Just changed money here again for a trip to china.
Wholesale market rate per yahoo finance, oanda, etc.
As of today is 6.47 yuan to the dollar.
I received 6.36 to the dollar with no fees.
That is not even a 2% spread.
How anyone can say this place is not the best in town is beyond me.
Apparently, anyone who disagrees does not travel or change money often.
Everytime i get by far the best rate, and there is no surcharge, no fees.
There is absolutely no way a casino offered the same rate as this place.
I think it was natalie and karen.
Thank you guys so much for your help.
Sometimes it's the small things in life and you guys helped me save a lot of time today!
I love this location so much better than the centennial one.
Everything is smoother and not as arduous as the other location.
Simple tasks at the centennial location require so much time effort manager approvals and looks of confusion.
The same tasks at the n. decatur location are quick and painless.
I've been to this branch about 5 or 6 times and i cannot say enough nice things about the employees.
Each person i've had the pleasure of assisting me is so friendly, pleasant, and provide excellent service.
Today for instance, i had a 2 year old with me.
A woman comes out from behind the counter and asks if she can give him a balloon.
I was blown away and he absolutely loved it.
I love this branch and even though it's out of my way, i won't go to another one.
Thank you for being so great to your customers!!
I like this location.
I am a fan of book stores because i love books.
I do like how this store is laid out.
You can find the section that you are looking for easily.
While they are quite efficient and don't take long per transaction, the conversation does not seem forced.
The staff seems genuine and professional.
This great location they girls are great and its scottsdale one dont want go to.
Both needs be fired.
But here the girls nice and serve donuts i love this bank here i drive father from scottsdale come here.
You guys rock pretty sad got drive to another city for good service.
I have been a member here for about 7 years now.
The staff is always helpful, the benefits of this credit union are great!
Multiple locations makes it easy to stop in no matter where you are in eastern cuyahoga, lake, or ashtabula.
Their rates are unbeatable.
They have a very comfortable waiting area with tv, keurig and other mild refreshments.
For members, they offer a coin counting machine.
Check out cardinal community credit union, they are way better than any bank out there!
This branch is always busy!!!
Like the location because it's right across the street from me...
I just wish the had more tellers since they're always busy...
I hate waiting in the long line because people don't respect your personal space!
All in all the workers are very helpful and friendly!
Nancy kinnard is awesome!
Love midfirst in general.
Drove by and needed the cash after hours.
Only one atm, no problem, fast in and out, definitely will recommend to friends.
Dane county credit union has been my financial institution since i opened my account when i was 15.
They have really gone above and beyond with helping me set good financial habits.
I really appreciate all of the e-services they have, including the ebanking and especially the chat feature on their website.
If i need help with something but don't want to call them, i can just go on and chat.
I also think they have some of the nicest staff around.
I don't think i will ever have a reason to change to a different credit union.
Coolest stuff thus far, always positive vibes.
I lost my bank card and was lost on how to pay my bills.
Everything was linked to my bank card.
One of the tellers had someone assist me.
Whom was very patient and showed me how to do the online banking or bill pay.
The moment i walk into this bank, someone is always asking me how they can help me.
The tellers are friendly and quick.
I always have a positive experience at this chase branch.
This place is great, good rates, fast service and friendly!
I hardly ever write reviews.... park across the street at no charge
Ive been banking here for quite some time and never had any issues.
I handled my personal and business accounts and if there were any questions they were always answered.
I ask the tellers how their day is going and we always have good small talks.
I always nab a blue lollipop from their bowl on the way out.
After our initial frustration, cardinal has gone to a lot of trouble to gain our business.
They've succeeded, and we're very happy with the outcomes.
Patience, and perhaps our feedback, has paid off and we're contented customers now.
If you are a culinary 226 union member this is our headquarters.
The building is a little on the old side but maintained really well.
Dollars to euros, today.
Very small transaction, still got the best rate.
1.155:1, no commission, no fee, no delivery charge, no bs of any kind.
Just simple, quick and done.
As i compute it, that is a spread over interbank rate of about 1.7%.
For sake of comparison, travelex at fashion show mall would demand a spread of close to 8%.
I know who has my business, and should have yours.
Elaine wynn banks here.
Floyd mayweather banks here.
George maloof banks here.
The tellers are all wonderful, kind, and helpful.
The space is beautiful- new, clean, and they have a lounge.
This bofa is awesome!
I probably step foot into a bank three times per year.
Seriously....i'm more of an atm kind of girl.
Plus, i also needed a notary.
Another potentially laborious process.
And the icing on the cake?
The notary service was free.
Not your typical financial organization they treat customers as other financial institution should.
Joe bryant williams was my loan officer who gave exceptional customer service.
My situation was complicated due to the original purchase of my home.
Joe found a way to offer me the options i needed with a refi/cashout loan.
You are loan officer extraordinaire!
I have been going to sam since i got my license and i couldn't be happier.
I hope to be with them for many more years.
This location despite being very busy has some good directorial firces that makes it run like a well oiled machine.
Ill be banking here for a longtime when i visit vegas.
I love this location.
It's beautiful & the two levels really set it off.
Great assortment of graphic novels, not just your typical comic book genre.
A lot of seating for reading which i enjoy.
Melissa bunyarattaphantu  is a pleasure to work with.
She really makes sure her clients are taken care of.
Great customer service and very knowledgeable.
I will let all my friends know about her.
Love the effing qt!!
Gas, brats, cheetos and monster!
And you can take a leak without getting any std's.
Recently switched banks and daniel was super nice and friendly to me.
With no charge !
That was appreciated thanks again you will be seeing me soon when i come in to make my savings account!
Excellent customer service and great rates on loans as well as savings/checking accounts have made me a believer.
We switched all of our accounts over about 2 years ago, and i am so glad we did!
Hands down the best rates in town.
I wasn't sure if they would have philippine pesos without ordering them.
Sure enough they had currency for my trip to china and the philippines.
The exchange rate was even close anywhere else in town.
Even while overseas the rate back in vegas beat most exchanges.
No added fees either
The uw credit union really cares and looks out for the welfare of their members.
Tracy & jessica are awesome did everything to help me with things i needed help with our bank accounts.
The ladies at the counter was very helpful and all are so polite at this bank
The only place i go for money exchange.
The rate is better than the bank.
The staff at this office are always a tremendous help!
Nikki and susan are the employees i've contacted the most and they give superior customer service!
Thank you state farm!
These people are amazing!
Totally trustworthy and so super nice to boot!
They know their stuff so i have no doubts about authenticity!
By the way, the girl at the front desk is awesome as is the bag/purse expert.
It's not only a great place to shop/buy, it's really enjoyable to talk with them as well.
The owner is super nice too!
Can't wait to go back.
They need a new screen on the atm.
The sun has made it hard to see through the screen.
Otherwise, this location has never given any bad services or issues.
I came to this place because i heard they had a great exchange rate from a friend.
After doing some research and checking a few major banks, i decided to give this place a try.
I was in and out in under 15 mins.
Make sure you have an idea of what the foreign money should look and feel like before you head in.
Doing some research will definitely help you out.
Australian money is plastic and very colorful!
I highly recommend this place for any money exchanges and if you have foreign money left over, don't worry!
You're able to exchange it back to usd and probably for a small fee.
I didn't have any left over so i can't say for how much.
Reason i'm leaving a review for this bank is because i left bank of america.
I hate it that bank and i finally found a bank that has great customer service and fast lines.
The staff is super friendly and there's no one here at all.
Bank of america and i'm never looking back.
As a small business owner i usually look at most banks as evil.
While i am sure they probably are to some degree, they are still a necessity for any small business owner.
We moved to charlotte 4 years ago and were with wachovia until the wells fargo changeover.
This branch is located in south park and is geared toward business clients.
We have been with boa for over six months now and could not be more pleased.
We got the lowest rates for our merchant services accounts and really like their online banking.
There have been two or three times where we needed quick assistance.
As far as demon bankers go, i have to say that our experience at this branch has been great.
Use too bank here a long time ago and i decided to come back
Friendly teller service inside.
Quick, efficient, and no wait.
Chase seems to be on point with providing good customer service.
This isn't the closes branch to me, but its the one i prefer.
Anyone that i have come in contact with here has been welcoming, and great at their job!
I walked in, used the bathroom and left.
I am a member, so i can do that.
I am glad they are still in business and i know it is a tough climate with amazon.
I spend a lot of money in their austin, tx store.
I've always had a great experience at citibank.
This one is very fancy and pretty.
Pretty easy to get in and out.
It could use some more parking.
Needed a quick loan and mario was great!
I would recommend them to anyone who needs a loan .
I picked up my collateral in two weeks and everything was professionally handled.
The folks at the serene & eastern are excellent!
They are patient and willing to help.
A very nice group of folks who are at this location.
Eva ramos yer great!!!
Thanks very helpful and professional.
Fast prompt service perfect atmosphere and received results was after
My favorite bank, fast, efficient, and courteous service!
Banking doesn't get any better than this!
Excellent is the only word i can use to sum it up!!
Have had state farm my whole adult life.
The staff knows their stuff, i definitely recommend to everyone!
I had thee best experience at the one az branch on 10/5, friday afternoon.
Wendy the branch manager went above and beyond to make sure my needs were met.
She blessed me this day with the help she graciously provided.
I came here with my husband to settle an estate account.
We had great service from the managers.
They answered our questions and were both super helpful.
I also felt safe when walking in and out when i saw the guard outside the door.
My teller art was very informative about one nevada and it's products.
Sam is an excellent agent.
He streamlined everything so that switching to arizona insurance was quick, easy and painless.
I'm happy i found him!
I just want to acknowledge nik and ramon at my home branch.
I am at b of a about 2 times a week.
They welcome me every time with a smile.
No matter how busy,  they always offer me help.
Sometimes there is a long queue, but they always make it pleasant.
As always say, customer service is so important.
I have my boa account open in california.
Surprise me that there left hand does not know what the right hand does.
Sorry, we cannot do this or do that.
Good lord, what is the purpose of hiring people who have little knowledge and wasting clients' time and their time.
So i decided, i still have to go to a real bank.
As i live in charlotte, they could not have access to information from california.
When i went to the branch at freedom drive, their staff has been very patient to call, check for me.
Since they know me, things get easier.
This place has a great selection of books for all ages.
There selection of starbucks coffee and cheese cake desserts , cookies.
They have seats everywhere, sample a book or magazine before you buy it
- this is one of the better chase locations i have been to in las vegas.
The interior is clean and orderly.
-the tellers have always been friendly and helpful.
- there is an ample amount of parking since it does share a parking lot with best buy.
The ladies here are so friendly and helpful!
There was a mistake in applying a payment and they resolved the issue immediately.
I come here to deposit my check every once in a while and the staff are always friendly and helpful.
It sometimes gets busy and the line gets backed up.
I see other staff just laying about.
Not sure why they don't help out if they can.
Even just for a minute so the bank tellers don't have to stress and the long line.
Regardless great wells fargo.
The staff here is very professional, helpful, and knowledgable!!
I am soo surprised that this branch has low ratings.
I have been banking with citibank for over 10 years and love it!
I found an issue with one of my accounts, went in on 11/28/17, and the issue was fixed!
Fang johnson was the gal that helped me.
She was very professional and i left happy.
She went above and beyond to make sure my issue was resolved.
I didnt have to wait at all either.
Jojo also helped me with my deposit, she was quick and efficient.
I have been a wells fargo customer for over 10 years.
I am quite a regular to this branch due to my place of work.
I have always received good service here and i am always greeted.
Some point soon - if i am able to apply for a mortgage, i would do it at this branch.
Service can be slow but generally good customer awareness.
There's nothing like holding a real book in your hands... please keep this store alive!
I enjoy spending without limits when it comes to books.
Love this bank, the tellers and the loan officer.
Convenient & quiet location, quick transactions.
I opened an acct and the experience was smooth.
Our rep, teresa popp, was knowledgeable, efficient, and personable.
Visited this location over the weekend to open a checking account and i had an amazing experience.
No wait at all, great conversation with teller joselyn and great conversation with ernice!
Happy they keep a notary service.
Deborah is very helpful.
Many chase locations have quit this service- hate chase but this is a good branch
Their currency is very fair.
I change to euro for 0.84 and i checked in the airport was 0.74.
I gueanteed their currency is the best in vegas
The customer service rocks in this place.
I opened account there only because my paychecks come from there and that its across the street from my apt.
I like walking to places instead of driving......being green you know.
So it is nice that its a block away.
The other thing is the place is never busy,and is clean.
If you go in there make sure to check him out.
Worth it by far.
Sam winter state farm insurance is the best!
I have moved to az and contacted this agency for my homeowners, liability insurance and auto insurance for 3 cars.
Melissa renda provided outstanding service and has been prompt and responsive.
I would highly recommend them.
My mom needed to exchange some money for her trip to europe and yelp did not disappoint.
Located in the tower on the first floor.
If you've ever taken an exam at the pearson test center, it's the same building.
The ladies up front were extremely nice and accommodating.
My mom's english isn't too good, but they took the time to listen to her and answer questions.
A great plus is that there is no fee for exchanges.
They even take whatever money you have left over to exchange back to dollars.
Tip: for euros/pounds they exchange up to the highest 5, so don't take any singles or coins back to them.
Validation for parking is also free!
It was an easy in-and-out exchange for us and i couldn't be happier with the whole ordeal!
Gas and so much more.
Quiktrip is always a great choice when it comes to refueling.
I find it a challenge to just purchase "gas" when i visit a quiktrip.
I like the soda fountain station, and the  multitude of snacks quiktrip has to offer.
I always manage to find a snack i hadn't had in quite some time, and it just calls my name.
In addition,  just like all quick trips this store is extremely clean, even more so then normal.
Reasonably priced gas, ice cold drinks, and snacks, it doesn't  get any better.
Very efficient and friendly service!
The best bank in us.
Susan r. must have been there on a bad day.
I find this to be one of the best locations to not have to get out of the car.
2 drive thru atms that move very fast and no crazy traffic around.
A very convenient chinatown bank
Not sure how there are wells fargo every 1.5 miles, but this is one that i enjoy going to.
They have the new atm that will accept checks and cash without envelopes.
This saves a lot of time.
The staff and employees are really courteous and professional.
If you cannot figure out which wfb to make your home, try this one!
I'm a real estate agent and had the pleasure of working with brad and amber.
This was a very smooth and flawless transaction.
Both brad and amber were a huge help and were always available to answer any questions i had.
I know who i will be referring my clients to.
Thank you for everything
This bank has been here for a while now.
They are really big on customer service here.
I have to really give them an a plus for that.
When you go in , they offer you bottled water, coffee and even some days they have cookies!
They are quick and very efficent, they always thank you for banking here.
That may not seem like a big deal, but i think it is.
Plus they really try hard here.
There is a drive thru, as well as lots of parking .
Nice place, and a good bank.
Professional and attentive service.
It's more like a credit union atmosphere, but with big bank services and convenience.
Clean and quiet bank.
Whenever i come here, the tellers are really nice, patient and friendly.
They are quick and efficient...what's not to love?
Asked for help finding books on a specific topic.
Great service, good value and fantastic people.
I trust my business with jared and state farm!
Big time progress has occurred here, and i must commend the effort regarding efficiency!
I love the hometown feel of nsb.
They're always cheerful & helpful so i enjoy the service i receive.
I always go inside the bank so i can work with a regular teller.
Seriously, i am absolutely so grateful that i stumbled upon this establishment prior to my trip to ireland.
Best part about this place, there is no fee for the exchange!
I've been their customer for over 2 years and have always enjoyed my service and premiums!
We're from out of town and don't have midfirst bank there.
However, we found ourselves in the chandler area on a saturday buying a used car from a private party.
We needed to withdraw a large amount of cash, but our bank doesn't have branches open on the weekend.
Midfirst bank saved the day!
If we had a midfirst bank branch in our hometown, i would seriously consider switching.
They were so pleasant, helpful, and accessible.
I was here yesterday and was so impressed with the customer service.
I brought my 81 year old mother in to open an account.
They were patient, respectful and amazingly patient with her.
There isn't much customer service around these days, but he was amazing!!!
I just wish i could remember his name..
He sits at a desk in front, dark hair, glasses and a great personality!!!
I would recommend this bank to anyone.
I have been with them for almost 4 years, no problems.
This is refreshing !!
My agent is celia and she is wonderful.
She is very informative and her service is always on point.
I have referred friends and family and they have gotten really good quotes for cars and homes.
I would recommend calling this agency to anyone that is looking for any kind of insurance and get a quote.
This is my "go to" spot for exchanging foreign currency.
Whenever i travel abroad i do some research on exchange rates in the country i'm visiting vs this joint.
I called prior to driving down here and asked what the exchange rate was.
They were offering 6.53 rmb to 1 usd.
Not a bad deal!
I'll pay the small vig for the convenience of dealing with someone in my home country where communication is easy.
One of the bad things about this place is the parking.
If you're a visitor, you have to park in the underground parking garage.
That's the last place you want to walk to after converting a lot of currency.
Which leads me to my second complaint about this place.....there's no privacy.
(see pics)  not a cool situation if you're counting a lot of money on the counter.
I've always felt uncomfortable in that sense.
Overall value - they offer great exchange rates, i'm always satisfied with the value they offer.
Unless a better option presents itself, there's no doubt i'll be back!
I recieved financial advise from one nevada credit union, serene branch.
Teresa popp introduced me to danny, their financial advisor.
He gave me great advise and offered his services with my financial situation.
The service i recieved from these two individuals was 5 stars and 2 thumbs up.
I have more knowledge regarding my financial options.
Great products and great customer service will always keep me a member.
I will definately continue to bank with one nevada credit union and recommend this institution to everyone.
Thank you teresa and danny!
Matt was a dream to sit next to for an hour while setting up my account.
He is so kind and easy to talk to and doesn't feel like you're talking to a robot.
He helped me get my business account up and running smoothly!
Super grateful for this chase bank experience
I like the fact that this is inside a safeway.
Not because it's safeway, but because they have longer banking hours than typical.
Plus, starbucks is inside too!
Right next to the wells fargo.
The people are nice and the lines have never been long for me.
They usually have candy or bottle water too.
Over the top customer service!
I had an issue with a client who banked with bofa.
I needed to go into this branch many times over a three week period.
Each and every time i was treated with politeness, courtesy and respect.
They properly and promptly handled my issue even though i personally was not even a bofa client!
I want to especially thank jasmine s. and matt d. for their exceptional customer service.
When it comes time for me to open any new accounts, etc.
It will be here!
I got insurance with sam about a year ago  and the process was absolutely seamless.
Thank you all so much!
As a coldwell banker real estate professional i amvery cautious about the services i refer my clients to.
Joellen james & state farm are one team that i feel great about  endorsing.
One thing we want from an insurance agent is everything, right?
I cannot say enough great things about my experience with toni!!
My husband and i were moving to cleveland from los angeles in september.
We were driving out and needed renters insurance when we arrived in a few days.
Now a month later we are closing on our house and needed home owners quickly for our loan.
Toni was on it!
I can't say enough about toni!
She truly cares, is super responsive and has a positive attitude that makes even insurance a pleasure.
Now if the bmv was so easy...
I can't say enough about this bank and this branch.
No atm fees ever.
Extended saturday hours and open on sunday!
Everyone knows your name.
David - one of the personal bankers is amazing.
Helpful, personable and even made opening an account for my kids an educational and fun experience.
Truly a community bank with a personal focus.
Melvin was a pleasure to work with.
I already feel great about my decision to open my account with this branch.
Just moved back from san diego and have to take care of my parents estate in fountain hills.
Best move i could of made.
The team of david, mark, erin, manny, treated me professionally, with honesty and integrity.
These people are highly knowledgeable, friendly, and know their business.
Myself and family would not consider going any where else.
They are first a loan, jewelry and pawn company, but they are also experts in dispersing estate items.
Biltmore is the best!
Do not change currency anywhere else.
Other places do not compete with this place at all.
The staff are friendly and knowledgable and the rates they charge are second to none.
They charge a rate always within 1-5% of the actual wholesale exchange rate on a currency and no fees.
Way better than other places that often charge a rate well above the market rate and add a fee.
Basically 1% below the market rate.
Hands down the best currency exchange place i have ever seen anywhere.
Great place to exchange money before leaving for an international trip!
Although this place is a little difficult to find, once there they provide fast and friendly service.
I'll be visiting this place again when going on another trip.
Good customer and location.
They also have a drive through and an outside atm.
I had to go inside for my transaction.
The line moved fairly quickly and i was out pretty fast.
Don't have anything to complain about at all.
Very friendly staff and great place to get gas and other things such as snacks and drinks.
Hands down the nicest q-trip i've been too!
Looks new and reminds me of an east coast fancier version of wawa!
They have lots of food, a snack bar and tons of candy!!
It's an amazing 7-11 on steroids!
I love this bank, they have never given me a hassle  about any thing.
They even let me bring my dog in and never a complaint
The tellers are courteous and the location is safe; there's not more that you could ask for.
I began to deal with wells fargo because my girl scout troop banks there.
They know me by name when i walk in and are always willing to help me out.
When told we were in limbo because we had just ordered new checks and hated to waste that money.
They quickly offered to provide me with new checks.
Izzy has be amazing and has helped us move everything over.
I look forward to banking here.
Sleek new branch with slick and functional atm machines.
Great corner convenience if you're headed east or south.
Not so much, the other way (justification for )
We recently purchased a new home.
Ricky khamis and chris arbuckle were fantastic.
Our loan rate changed from our initial conversation and i've read that many felt they were deceived, we were not.
Ricky was constant in his communication and we felt certain he was doing his very best for us.
The team that worked on our behalf were professional.
And in the end of the day and the transaction that made all the difference.
And to top the whole thing off they had pizza delivered on moving day for my kids!
Well done and cheers to them!
I have accounts at both chase and wells fargo.
Chase is by far the superior of the two.
The employees at this location are extremely friendly.
Many know us by name, and several have said hi when running into us in the grocery store, church, etc.
I appreciate their friendliness and great customer service and will bank here for a long time to come.
I just completed my mortgage refinance and it went great.
Jeff and shana walked me thru the entire process.
Done on time and no issues.
I would work with this team any time.
I am sooooo excited, it's my lucky day!
I saw a heaping stack of silver dollar coins and a stack of fifty cent pieces as well.
My daughter's coin collection is so sweet now.
Don't worry, i'm taking them straight to the safe deposit box.
This is going to be insanely valuable.
Thanks to my visit at the bank today, my 3 year old daughter now owns coins from elvis presley's hay-day.
Thanks so much to whoever gave their collection to chase.
Got my currency changed here when visiting on a trip.
Service was excellent and the staff was really friendly
The staff here really helped my girlfriend.
Tanya the teller notice some weird transactions on her card we didn't even know about.
Went out of her way to show us everything even with a little line.
Greg helped us handle everything.
They both were patience and awesome and just saved her a headache!
This has been my bank for years, it only gets better as the members increase.
There's atms everywhere, few charges, free checking and best of all online check deposit.
Most everyone is very friendly and helpful, never any problems here!
Being a client with the cathay bank for 3 years since it opens at vegas.
I really appreciate their excellent services.
The stuff is very helpful and professional.
Manger  mr. golden and nissha always nice  and patient  .
Ms. nissha is very warm , precise, patiently answers every question we asked about our business account.
The teller odet always smiles at the client.
Ms. fuqi is happy and joyful while she helps the client.
She helps me open my 2 credits cards.
The whole stuff has such a positive working attitude i have learned.
My company have been with them for years.
I opened my both saving and checking account with cathay bank since they have such  good services.
I still refer my friends and co-workers to  open  accounts with the bank.
I just want to say thanks for their dedicated services.
What a great experience with a sweet knowledgable arlene bark.
Thank you for your kindness and help.
I have received excellent service from the staff here.
I really thought mr. basha took very good care of me and my accounts.
We bought 2 cars through julio and had the fastest and easiest experience.
Their cars are amazing and the service is amazing!!!!
The place was a little hard to find my first time.
You really can't see it until you're passing it or you turn directly onto the street.
They are extremely nice and aren't crazy busy like most other wells fargos(probably because people can't find it.
Great service each and every time!!
The service is great, which makes up for their understaffed team.
Everyone and the manager have a great attitude and are very willing to help.
Not the bank i frequent, but definitely helpful since its the closest to home!
This bank gets a total of five stars from me.
They are professional and on point.
I love this wells fargo in my book its the best location in vegas.
I've banked all over town and this bank is by far the best in customer service and bank fees.
The location is a bit out of the way but they do offer a great option for online banking.
If your a business customer they also have an option to do remote deposits!
They have an atm on the outside of the branch so you can make deposits after hours or withdraw cash.
Today finoa helped me and she was friendly and fast.
There was no line and so i was in and out.
The bank is just off the 215 on west russell and has a large parking lot.
Scott was excellent in getting out loan approved.
We got the approval and closed about a week later (4/20/16).
Fantastic with updates and keeping us informed, was present at our closing as well.
Thank you again, the professionalism was much appreciated.
I love how the 24 hour atm service has the cash deposits built in.
This is a great convenience for tipped employees being we carry so much cash to the bank all the time.
Out of the choices offered, this branch is one of the nicer branches.
The staff are friendly, professional and love the ability to park in front of the bank.
When visiting family or working on this side of town i love using this chase.
It is one of the few that has a drive-thru atm.
I don't have to get out of my car or anything.
I went inside once last year and the staff was friendly and the bank was clean.
I pretty much use the handy dandy drive-thru atm.
I want to thank linda m. for contacting me on this matter and for being so helpful.
She was very understanding and made everything a lot easier experience with this onenevada branch.
I am updating this review because i do believe not everyone should suffer for one person's actions.
I highly recommend this branch now due to linda.
Thank you again for your help.
**i don't even know where to begin.
I normally don't name names, but i do believe this is a time to do so.
First of all, i don't appreciate how you handled or lack thereof my husband's business.
When he left, you simply said everything is done.
I have called 5 times.
Thank goodness someone helped us after the 5th hour.
My husband was going to be late for work.
Rosie, i am breaking up with onenevada.
Your customer service skills need help.
I'll be back on saturday to close our account.
I hope this will help you to grow and learn how to handle a professional situation.
I only hope for the best.
I'm glad that branches are still available to where you can talk to somebody in person about your needs.
Because, you cannot always find your answer online.
Or, schedule an appointment for the next day.
The ability to submit documents electronically and communicate through email is very convenient and accommodating to my busy schedule.
Thanks stan, thanks stephanie!
Moved to this agent, as i had a previous horrible experience with my previous agent.
Staff is knowledgeable, professional and always responds to any questions i may have.
I will definitely recommend this agent to friends and family.
Roger is a very easy person to speak to and really explains why a policy fluctuates and what to expect.
State farm needs more agents like him.
In have worked with roger for many years now with my personal insurance as well as my companies insurance.
Great guy who actually cares about what is best for you.
I highly advise using roger, just give him a call and see for yourself!
I'm most familiar with the atm at this location.
Solid workers, good location and they make sure everything goes smoothly and all is well.
I absolutely love this bank location -- why?
Cuz david cruz is the most amazing banker everrr!!!
Exceptional customer service and goes above and beyond to help.
They were able to fix my credit and debit card problems when the branch on rue university couldn't.
Unlike that branch, they were able to solve everything without asking too many questions, and they were patient.
Best service i ever received at a financial institution.
Bonus, the supervisor helping me out was a very attractive young man.
So 5 stars instead of 4, despite having only gone there once.
This is the branch closest to me so i've been quite a bit!
Maybe i happen to come at off-peak times, because they've always been pretty fast.
The last couple visits where i've actually had to go in, there was no line.
They always know what they're doing though & they're professional.
When i had to meet with a banker he was personable & very helpful!
Opened a new account in less than 30 minutes.
Comes with amazing benefits such as retirement accounts and good loan rates for a new car or house.
The man who helped me seemed rush to be done with me so that's why i gave 4 stars.
The bankers at cathay bank are very friendly and efficient.
We came here for a wire transfer to escrow, and the bankers here offered very professional help.
We got everything done in 5 minutes.
The bofa across the street is terrible, 45 mins wait for a simple wire transfer.
Omg anyway, i couldn't thanks cathay bank more for their excellent service.
Their banker, kevin even give me a good follow up the next day.
I would recommend this bank to my clients.
Tim and lacy are simply the best!!
I could not have asked for a more professional and responsive team.
I would use people's mortgage again and again -- and i will when i am ready to refinance.
Buying a new car when you are 21 is not easy!
And if you got the right resource such as alexa, you are in great hands.
She's very flexible, professional, and respectful.
My experience at bofa very lovely and i thank alexa for that!
Hats off to you!
Had a great experience with holly making my banking quick and easy!!
Made my day and it's rare to get great customer service these days but this bank has it down!
Ricky with amerifirst financial is so great to work with!
Always responds to calls and questions in a very timely manner.
Its always such a pleasure to work with ricky and his entire team!
The teller, who is aptly named champagne, made my day.
She was friendly and very professional and i was very impressed with her enthusiasm and passion for her job.
She is a huge asset to this bank.
I was impressed enough to call her manager to praise her.
I'm always going to prefer a credit union over a traditional bank.
Don't ask me why - it's just what i do.
I never had to come in.
The process was easy and fast!
When you visit this location, there's a counter to sign in at if you need to talk to an employee.
Otherwise, walk to one of the tellers, fill out form and shoot your stuff in the tube up the hole.
They talk to via a screen.
You can pick up the phone for privacy.
I recently needed to apply for a car loan and my first thought was to go through my credit union.
But if i had known how easy they would have made it- it would have been my only thought.
The pre-approval process took 5 minutes.
But i walked out like woah, did that really happen that fast?
So i purchased a car, went back to the bank to sign the purchase and finance paperwork.
That whole process again - super fast.
She literally had everything ready for me and it was the easiest process ever.
I got a stellar rate.
I'm hardly paying any money towards interest.
Hands down a winner in my book!
I have a last minute check that i need right now.
My bank wants to put a hold on it, understandable, but i need the money now.
So, i have to find a bank of america.
I walk to one nearby my school, they can't do it.
They suggest i go to this location.
I high tail it over there.
They close at 5:00, its 5:03.
A very kind woman is locking the door as i rush up.
The woman at the other branch had not mentioned that they close at 5:00.
I slump over, defeated.
Then this angel looks at me, turns the key the other way, opens the door, and waves me in.
Cash in hand i left, crisis averted.
Bank of america, the employees at this location are saints.
They saved my life, or at least my gpa as that money went  towards desperately needed school books.
This branch is now on my christmas card list.
I went there recently to discuss options for my new business and peter was a one stop shop.
He and walked me through my business account and what i needed.
He even had all the information printed and ready for me to sign before i walked in the door.
Then, he contacted the other departments to help get me set up with insurance and a merchant account.
I highly recommend this branch.
Extremely proficient and highly recommended.
I usually always go here.
There is sometimes a wait and no matter how often i come in they never recognize me.
Taylor is the personal banker assisted me today.
He was very helpful and kind.
He had all the paperwork ready before i got there.
It was all a smooth process.
First i called and asked the branch if they had a notary in house.
They did and she was taking clients as they walked in.
Got there, and there was no line at all.
I was immediately brought to the notary that they had, meegan.
She was very nice and it was a super quick process.
As a note this branch is inside albertsons but it had a teller and banking areas.
The bank is nice.
The atmosphere inside is very great.
The staff are super friendly and are extremely knowledgeable.
I have been banking here for a few years now, and i love it!
Transparency is what rings the most here.
I set up my first ever credit card with chase bank on their unlimited freedom card.
I was explained all fees (if applicable), all interest rates and what my best option was.
The only reason i wanted a credit card was to simply build my credit.
I would recommend this card for any first time credit card users!
The level of service, competitiveness of rates and ease of communication is genuinely outstanding.
Just an fyi :)
Convenient... just the way i like my men (ha, joking of course)
:) from the happy new homeowners from buckeye, az.
Been coming to this bank for about 4 years.
Always a smile on their faces.
Never had a problem with them.
Kelly and quentin were right there with me every step of the way through my mortgage process.
Well, the weston team made it all happen and even closed two days early!!
Superior customer service and would definitely use them again!
After finding service fees for my 40+ year checking account i called the 800 # for wells fargo.
I was not pleased with the service on the phone so decided to walk into the branch on n. durango.
It was a pleasure doing business with jessica!!!!
So my parents finally kicked me off of their policy and i had to start my own.
This was a little scary- i've never done insurance-y things before!
This office has been phenominal!
They are constantly figuring out ways to get me better deals while maintaining excellent coverage.
They have never made me feel stupid or uncomfortable.
I really appreciate that!
On top of it all, i got a bomb swag bag when i left the first time!
Overall a great experience at this branch.
We'll definitely be doing business at this branch from here on.
Great job....keep up the good work guys.
This insurance agency has been an absolute pleasure to deal with!
I have a renter's insurance policy and automotive policy through them and can't find a better rate.
Since i have both policies, each one is discounted.
I got my renter's insurance policy for an extremely competitive price.
Whenever i call there is someone there to answer or i receive a call back right away.
Everyone i have dealt with has been professional and up front and honest with everything.
If you're looking for insurance definitely give this agency a try!
I am getting away from bank of america.
I opened a checking account and found out i will not have to pay fees.
Kristen explained everything and was very helpful.
They are always super nice!
Never ask if i want to open an account or the usual sales stuff.
I was shocked by the other review - although looking at it now, it was in 2012.
Great bank, i recommend it to everyone needing a bank.
Just moved from wa and ali helped me with my transfer of policies.
Needed to remove, update and add policy's.
He made the transfer seamless and kept me updated throughout the process.
I worked with cesar munoz and he was very punctual and made sure everything went smoothly.
I moved to pittsburgh's east end from fairfax county, virginia in late-2010.
Little to no wait time.
Helped me quickly get a replacement bank card when mine came up missing.
Very easy to work with.
This employees at this branch are always very nice and helpful.
They have always made sure that all of my accounts that i have are meeting my needs still.
I have a lot accounts due to a company that i own.
I have never had any issues here.
No troubles with this lorain national bank location.
I don't use it that much, but when i do it is good.
The gentlemen that helped me just now was caleb and he was a fast worker.
He had great customer service and got us sat down and out in less than 5 minutes.
He answered any and every question i had and i felt really comfortable asking him anything i needed to know.
Today i went to the bank to pay off a bank loan.
Ryan lee, the branch manager, was very friendly and helpful.
He patiently walked me through the whole process.
I also noticed that he personally greeted every customer that walked into the bank.
Thanks again for the great customer service.
Finally a chase opened up in my neighborhood.
Clean, nice bankers, no wait and friendly.
I love the staff here... very friendly and easy to talk with, and there's never a long wait.
I'm always in and out within minutes.
Never had any issues with them yet and will continue to return here whenever needed.
I love desert schools.
The have been quite helpful in many areas.
Brad b sounds like a big cry baby whining about $2.00 statements.
You can print them out for free on-line.
Calm down brad...everything will be o.k.
I have read the old reviews, the atmosphere has changed and reviews are no longer representative of the new staff.
I have been banking here for my business since 2014.
Love the new manager lauren and her staff.
Craig and everyone are always smiling and seem happy to be there and most of all go that extra step.
They got my online business account access fixed.
Nick was great with the business line of credit process.
Hope we can keep this small bank relationship in the big bank world.
If only they had a drive-thru, i'd give them 5 stars.
Courteous, kind, friendly helpful staff like all desert schools (soon to be desert financial) employees w/ ada teller.
After contacting property management president, mgmt put in a handicapped space/ramp (still need more than one) next to the atm.
One person can make a difference.
I was also wondering whether the 2.89% (2.92% apr) could be true or was just a ruse to entice customers.
A review i read online suggested this might be the case.
That was a straightforward and uncomplicated process.
- third federal paid for all required documentation from the credit check through the appraisal and title work.
I received a free copy of the appraisal, credit check and my credit score.
I am a "squeaky wheel" kind of customer.
The extra effort paid off.
This was the only mild surprise in the entire process.
That part of the process took just one hour.
****  four years ago, i refinanced with the very big bank that's been in the news.
At that time, i thought 4% was a great rate even with pretty hefty closing costs.
What bothered me immensely about that other institution is that they didn't treat me well at all.
I felt hassled and beleaguered right up until the loan was approved.
Quite the opposite occurred on this, my final refinancing for this house.
My closing costs for this loan really and truly amounted to $295*.
In recent years they have expanded their mortgage loan program to other states, including mine.
I hope that if you're reading this review it will balance some of the negative comments that others have made.
*one final note: today, i received a $100 home depot card as a gift for refinancing with them.
That means my refinancing fee was effectively $195!
This desert schools location is great!
Whenever i need to deposit a check, i can get in and out quickly.
The staff members are very friendly and helpful.
I thought that was a nice touch!
I love my state farm agent, joann alvarez, and her staff of extraordinary women.
She has been my agent for over 20 years.
She has saved me money on car insurance, home owners insurance, life insurance, and renter's insurance.
She been there through five children and now grandchildren.
We were numb and she took us by the hand.
I will never ever forget what this woman has done for my family.
Today, years later, i am able to call up her team and get the best service anytime, day or night.
I don't shop around for rates because i know i have an amazing team behind me.
They didn't pocket the money.
They sent it back.
They make my life easy and i always feel safe.
Isn't that why we have insurance?
Nothing beats that peace of mind.
No one rates higher in my book than joann.
I will never have another agent.
You can find me on facebook if you feel i might be "planted."
Michelle russell from gilbert, arizona.
Go ahead and "hit me up" cuz, baby, i'm covered for that by the best!
I used desert school for a new truck i bought at the dealer ship.
But then later found out the dealer ship went to another bank with out me knowing about.
One of the bankers called me to inform me the application wasn't with desert school.
The interest rate was 3.2% with the other bank.
I went back to the deal ship asked them to switch it to desert schools.
Once the paperwork was finalized my interest rate dropped to a 2.79.
Thank you desert schools for doing your due diligence.
Tami and macee did a phenomenal job helping me close on my home in a timely fashion.
Kudos to both of them!
I am an accountant and i have been in canada for more than 30 years.
I recommend this bank to my friends and family.
Just stopped in because i wasn't having luck with using the app to deposit a check.
All of a sudden the app is real picky with depositing checks.
Anyways, slight inconvenience but that's what happens with technology and apps that need updates.
Hopefully it works good again soon.
There was a line when i went in, but it's saturday and it moved fast.
I hate having to go into the bank to stand in line to do my banking.
I am one of those always on the go, busy, busy, busy single moms with very little time to spare.
And i don't like spending what little time i do have waiting at the bank.
Thankfully there is this lovely branch right across the street from my building.
No need to park.
No need to come in during busy times.
I come in mid morning and am helped right away.
I mean five minutes in and out.
Normally i would be disappointed but it's okay when we're talking about banks.
;)   the staff is always super friendly and always complimentary.
Anyways, banking here has always been a joy.
Busy but very efficient.
The line moves very quickly and the tellers are all very polite and friendly.
There are four green machine abms that are available for use even when there is no one working.
Just opened an account with wells fargo and had an excellent experience.
I do a lot of travel and needed a card sent to me asap.
The staff there was awesome and helped set it up for me to receive my new card within three days.
They answered all my questions and made the process of setting up a new account extremely easy.
Definitely a positive experience.
Talk about great customer service!!!
The customer service here is outstanding!!
Manager was courteous and efficient!
It resolved my issue!
Thank you yomaira for giving me consistent updates and greet me with a beautiful smile!
The employees are really friendly.
I'm not really a conversationalist when it comes strangers, but they always manage to break me out of shell.
For me, finding the right insurance agent is a big decision!
Having a bad insurance agent is a lot worse than having a bad meal!
I've been working with david for over two years now.
I can rely on him to make the best recommendation for me.
For the claims i've had he's always quick to address them and make sure he answers all my questions.
I don't feel like just another faceless policy holder, i actually feel like he treats me like a friend.
He's a great guy and someone i know i can trust!
I come here to use the shared branch services; as im from down south!!!
I receive the best service at this location, especially from eddie,the assistant manager.
Once again i had a great experience with gigi,  jesse, sandra and raymundo.
These are beautiful people and they give great service.
I lost my key for the merchant night deposit safe.
They brought over a key right away.
This is the service that i know about wells fargo.
A teller kept her calm while a client lost his cool from his own issue.
Always speedy and polite.
Even recommended times to come in!
Never seen a line up yet!
Update: can i give midfirst a 6/5??
Not midfirst - they are on it!
So glad we quit bofa and switched to a smaller bank that cares.
Midfirst bank is what banks used to be back in the day.
Someone always answers the phone.
There's always a smile and just enough friendly chit chat.
They remember me when i walk in!
Most importantly, my financial questions are answered and my financial needs are met.
My girls get suckers and smiles every time.
I half think my dog would get a bone if i took him through the drive-thru.
We have hardly any bank frees and atm fees charged by other banks are reimbursed to our account.
We've had nothing short of amazing service with this company.
Professional and friendly staff.
They have made all 3 loans i have had through them a very quick and easy process.
I swichted to nbaz in july and i couldn't be happier with them!
I really like this bank, my only negative is the lack of bank locations.
Keep up the good work guys!
Had an amazing car buying and selling experience at reliable auto sales!
They played no games and were up front and very help full during my visit.
I was very happy with the offer and decided to sell my truck to them.
I would recommend reliable auto to any one in the vegas market.
I was greeted by two tellers, i decided to have marci help me who was very friendly.
The inside decor has a very modern feel almost contemporary.
All the tellers look very professional and even had matching colors which sounds lame but they pulled it off.
I had a good experience.
This branch is full of the nicest people!
I've never seen anyone there in a bad mood nor having a bad day...they're always so friendly & helpful.
Also, unlike the other major banks, u.s. bank still has good (and affordable) checking services.
*one caveat: the 1-800 call center for u.s. bank is extremely rude and unhelpful.
Nevertheless, this branch rocks!
I'm a big fan.
We always stop at this chase bank on saturday mornings during our walk around the farmers market.
I usually have a check that needs to be cashed or deposited and saturday mornings is always the most convenient.
And they always ask if we want small bills for the farmers market, which is a plus.
5 stars, capitol chase bank rocks!
Wells fargo has really a stepped it up!!!
Wow thats what i call customer service!!
This location is at least 3 times bigger!!!
I can see how the manager and the staffs feel so excited and proud of this sparkling new location!
Lines are never too long... but i usually just prefer using the instant teller.
The staffs here are always helpful and some of them have been working here for a long long time!
Though not open on sundays, for sunday banking go visit the branch at mccowan and bullock!
Maybe the best team ever!
Clear communication from the start and never a hiccup.
No hesitation recommending ryan and his team to anyone.
I've been recently making account deposits for work at this bank.
This branch location is just past the waterworks shopping area on freeport rd.
Bank tellers are always friendly and welcoming!
They often serve soft chocolate chip cookies for customers.
I usually pass on the cookies and go straight for the dum-dums suckers lol!
There are 7 branches in the greater pittsburgh area.
They are open until 6p on fridays.
There are three bank tellers in their lobby and two drive-thru lanes outside.
If i didn't already do my personal banking elsewhere, i'd gladly open an account here.
Julio lopez is fantastic!!
I bought a car for my 16 year old son here.
Julio went above and beyond to ensure he got a great safe car.
He even let us kidnap him to visit an independent mechanic.
Super nice guy and honest.
He really cared about making sure my son got a great first car.
Anthony helped us and he was so nice!
He went above and beyond what we were expecting.
Ask for anthony when you go in!
He was the best!
One nevada credit union and financial service representative dawn craig, awesome!!!!
I transferred all of my accounts from chase, which offers poor customer service at most local branches.
This branch is located inside of the albertson's.
There is an atm and a small counter with about 3 tellers for your convenience.
I have always found the wait time to be under 5 minutes each time i have used a teller.
They are friendly and ask if you need other assistance.
Had to withdraw some quick cash today .
So i ran over quick to this location (which i have fequented before), to grab the funds .
As always, the employees were cheerful, courteous, and didn't try to offer you any unneed services.
Three people ahead of my, and guess what .
The visit was quick .
And i was outta there.
Nothing worse than going to the bank and spending 20 - 30 minutes in line .
I wish the withdrawal limit at the drive-thru was higher .
If i only wanted a couple hundred dollars, i would have used the atm.
I went to this branch right around christmas time.
Excellent attitude and most beautiful demeaner i have seen in a very long time.
I just wanted her to know that she was not forgotten and keep up the good work .
I also hope the branch recognizes she is a valuable asset.
I wish more tellers were like her and not so sterile.
She brightened up my whole day.thank you jasmine and god bless.
Ask for anna when you go inside.
Not only is she beautiful, but she'll save or make you a lot of money.
They were able to close my loan 20 days faster than other lenders.
They also helped me through a refinance in the past.
Brian szabo was very helpful and i would recommend him to anyone.
This is our 6th home purchase, and scott was the first mortgage broker we've ever had attend the signing appointment.
5 star service all the way!
Wanted to thank edina for helping me take of a fee i had on my account.
I recently purchased a vehicle here.
After talking to a few salesman, i found out these guys work on a salary, not a commission.
I think that made the difference, not pushy or hurried.
Salvador was patient and approached this with a 'best deal on the lot' mentality.
Kudos to the policy makers for this company!
Then i had to answer questions like: what am i going to use the car for, business or personal?
If i purchased it, how would i be paying?
I hadn't even looked inside yet alone drove it.
It was night and day my friends.
I know on my next purchase, i will look here first.
No more wells fargo for me... as of right now chase has meet up to my expectations.
Everytime i have walked in to this location someone greets me.
The only bad this is they charge like $25.00 for checks.
It is still worth it.
The location is perfect i work right around the corner.
It is also very clean.
Stay tuned for more because the call center customer service might change this review.
The parking is kinda horrid but the service is great.
No complaints there at all!
I love this bank (and this particular location.)
They're always so helpful and professional and i've never had a problem with them unlike other banks i've dealt with.
Hopefully i never do but i'm sure it'll be fine.
The banker possibly the branch manager there was wonderful.
I went in twice with the same problem regarding a fraudulent check.
Bottom line because chase denied it he ended up crediting me from his brunch budget.
Small amount but totally appreciated.
Thank you mr chase dude.
You made me smile.
Julio is a good salesperson and took his time showing us around.
This is our second car purchase from this dealership and it won't be the last.
Thank you julio and reliable auto sales.
I have been with this bank since 1998 and have never exerienced any problems.
The associates are always nice and friendly.
If you need a solid bank with very competent employees try wells fargo.
First off, there were no lines at the counter.
The cashier prompted me to have a seat to have one of there managers come help.
Pleasantly surprised i walked into his office and told him what i needed.
He asked me a couple questions and before i knew it i had a checking and savings account.
Juan the manager was polite attentive and on top of his game.
5 stars for juan and his staff.
Keep up the good work.
Bank of america no longer allows a chashiers check to be made out to a p.o.
Box be it a company or personal.
Let me preface this story with a few facts: boyfriend and i are money idiots.
Thank the sweet baby jesus we got shondra.
Wonderful, knowledgeable, kind, incredibly helpful and patient and funny and did i mention kind already shondra.
So shondra, without batting an eye, took care of them.
All six of them.
I should also mention that through all of these shenanigans, shondra maintained the perfect blend of professionalism and understanding.
Which, incidentally, is in the four corners.
Thank you shondra, i actually can't wait to go back!
Had a heloc for 10 years, and chose to also renew it with them.
Rate is very good, and i have never had a single issue with them.
Yes the process as others mentioned did take 60 days which they told me it would up front.
Only issue is if you have a home in a living trust...then they won't help you..
I currently have three banks: wells fargo, desert schools, and chase.
I use them all fairly equally.
This particular branch is very nice.
Everyone always acknowledges you when you walk into the branch and when you are leaving.
Overall, i would recommend this particular branch because i haven't had any issues.
The lines have always been short around 11 am on weekdays (right before the noon lunch people get there).
I haven't been to this bank on the weekends because it is by my work.
Just like every other wells fargo, nothing special.
No drive thru atm, but the drive thru is open during business hours.
Minus one star for the overly excited manager.
It's a constant "well we are sooooo glad to help you out today with whatever you need!!!"
In a high pitched voice.
I just put my head down and pray that she doesn't talk to me.
Is it really that hard to be genuine?
Very friendly people but this location is definitely a busy one.
If you're going to try the drive thru teller i would suggest hitting it before 4:30pm if at all possible.
There are only two at this location- the third lane is a drive up atm.
I stopped into see erin, who is a business banker, for a quick notary today.
He did a great job and informed me that past notaries have not been properly notarizing documents for me.
B of a...what can i say?
Let's start with parking.
Teeny, tiny, postage stamp sized lot.
Sometimes there's a dude there helping folks get in and out.
I think i see him hanging in his dodge k car with the a/c cranked listening to the moody blues.
Who can blame him in this horrific heat.
Actual bank is on first floor of high rise on central.
They just remodeled the lobby and frankly i don't see  much of a difference.
But four stars for the staff.
Shout out to daniel especially.
He always takes care of me in the merchant line.
I know, it's a meaningless and shallow point in my day...what can i say?
Bank of a long ass wait?
I say b of a...bank of america!
Hand on heart, standing tall....over and out yelpers!
So i booked an appointment for today almost a month ago with a rbc rep on the telephone.
Showed up today for my 9:30 am appointment and my branch had no record of this appointment.
Anyway, everyone was great and i managed to see an investment specialist right away.
They were also very accommodating with my service dog who was with me.
I know it should be a given, but believe me, it isn't.
I dealt with three different employees at the branch and everyone was so helpful and pleasant.
It almost makes me sad that i do most of my transactions online.
Their team of professionals have always done an excellent job of taking care of all their clients needs and expectations.
This is a newish branch of td canada trust located in maple leaf square.
It's pretty small but has a nice open feel.
My assistant was efficient and extremely friendly.
Deposited a cheque and then went downstairs to longos to spend my money.
Not open sundays at the moment...
Bought over 20 cars myself here!
And referred at least another 20 people here!
Great pricing and great cars.
Never been duped here!
Financing possibilities like nowhere else.
Dave is the man to talk to and if he doesn't get it done you clearly can't buy a car.
Mary is the sales agent you want to use!
Arman the owner will get you any car you want for the best price!
I have been banking with them for over two years, they have been very helpful maintaining my account.
The service is excellent, along with very friendly people.
I am very glad i am a member of arizona federal credit union!
You cant expect a lot.
That being said they are some of the nicest banking industry people i have ever had to deal with.
Very friendly and kind.
And between them is a metal detector.
It is sort of like going into a prison.
Ricky was extremely knowledgeable about the market, rates, etc.
And always showed a sense of urgency.
Thank you, ricky and amerifirst finiancial team!
The staff are very accommodating and giving of information from the beginning.
They also greet you upon entering and are very attentive while they are taking care of other patrons.
What was really nice that there were bilingual tellers behind the counter.
Great to hear and view.
My teller was the utmost in knowledge and customer service.
She was very attentive and even told me congrats on my new business card that was approved.
I really liked going here even though the main road was clogged with traffic and construction work.
Overall wells is a great bank and i am very proud of being in business with him.
Truely fantastic service i've had with them.
I came to their office with problems in a wire transfer and don earle jumped in and saved the day.
Thanks wells fargo and don!!!
I had an issue with a money order that required a stop pay and reissue.
Good folks, highly recommended.
Perfect banking location right off the freeway.
There is plenty of parking and a walk up atm.
There is a business deposit box outside for business drop offs for quick or nightly deposits.
My visit at this wells fargo was phenomenal !!!
I was lucky to work with yesenia rodriguez, she was extremely professional & helpful!
She helped me open a new credit card and was able to flawlessly answer all my questions!!!
She went above and beyond to help make my experience wonderful!!
Thank you so much your time was greatly appreciated.
I am reviewing this specific location because the website lists it as the main office/corporate.
I am so pleased with this bank.
I just had a 3-day long conversation back and forth with misty (online rep).
Even though she explained clearly how they were assessed, she still submitted my request for refund to the higher powers.
I just checked today and the fees were refunded!
I'm so happy i closed my b of a account and switched to these guys.
Its been almost a year since opening my nbaz account and life is good.
These guys provide real personal service.
My emails are always answered promptly and clearly.
Although misty explained that in my situation i would probably not get refunded, she still submitted my request.
Ok, so the situation was that i sent an e-check somewhere.
(i suppose that means confirm receipt).
I had assumed the check cleared already, then went ahead and swiped my card at the store.
Sure enough, the next day i had overdraft fees.
Apparently the check cleared at some point the day before, but after i had looked at my balance.
My fault for assuming the check cleared.
I just assumed it had processed the same way all my previous online payments had.
It varies vendor to vendor, and not 100% under the bank's control.
I understand now, thanks to misty's time.
I would definitely recommend this bank to anyone who asked.
One of the appealing things that originally brought me here was their low direct deposit requirement to waive bank fees.
Only $100 monthly as opposed to $250 that b of a asked.
And if i remember correctly, the $250 b of a was asking for was all in one deposit.
It was not a cumulative number that nbaz uses.
When you work in retail, and hours can get cut in the blink of an eye, this matters.
One if the very best car buying experiences we have ever had!
I found the car we bought on the true car app and filled out the form.
We received a phone call from mitch within the hour and made an appointment to come see him.
He was extremely professional and forthcoming and had us in the car the very next day.
I would recommend this place to everyone!
And we will be going back when we look for a car for our daughter.
That said, this location is awesome, i've never had a problem coming in here and depositing checks or cash.
Awesome friendly service every time i go in for my banking needs!
Never have had any problems banking at this location.
This rbc branch has a bank concierge, and she remembered my name the next day.
She remembered my name!
The workers here at this location are very knowledgeable very friendly and are always willing to help.
Never had any problems with this bank like i have with other banks in the past.
Oh and they gave me a fabulous refinance rate on my vehicle couldn't be any happier.
Open your account here!
I have been dealing with secu for many years and have always had a good experience.
I learned that yes we have bed experiences as customers but if we could only give a chance...
Always great service !
Ask for nika or arturo.
They don't give free money lol but it helps to know the right people
Not certain why this location has such a low rating.
Every time i visit, it is very clean and well managed by staff.
The tellers are very professional, nice and accommodating.
I hate going to the bank but these employees make it not so bad.
If you're in the area and need to make a bofa run, i don't find any issues stopping here.
It's pretty much on par for me.
I think this is actually the best banking experience i've ever had.
They are always polite, quick to answer my questions.
I've never had any negative account issues.
Good location as far as banks go.
See luz as an account manager.
She will take care of you.
Worked with shana, she was a joy to work with!
Went in today to do the job i hate the most each month-wire money into my loan at home.
They are always just so friendly and efficient.
Bullet point summary: -shiny and new -open sundays -friendly staff.
Yvonne gave me excellent service and went above and beyond to make sure all my needs were met.
I could not be more satisfied!!
I stop here frequently on the way down to the 'rents house.
What else can you say about a bank?
It serves my needs.
I am back and the only difference is that i got even better service this time!
Btw: brittany singh (personal banker) helped me and she was amazing!
She is definitely an asset to the company.
With the exception of a long line wait on occasion, this place is not bad.
I have found the customer service to be friendly and helpful.
No one has ever been rude or impatient with me.
You can generally set up something at their help desk fairly easily.
My recent san diego home purchase.
I give our loan originator, mr. ariel jessop with peoples mortgage in salt lake city.
My highest respect and recommendation.
He knows what he's doing.
Customizing our needs to terms, that looked out for our best interests.
On our behalf, ariel also helped with getting our purchase offer accepted.
By communicating with sellers, who had ten other offers.
We got the house!
Honestly, i couldn't have done better.
Having ariel jessop doing our loan, with on time closing and contingencies shorter than usual.
All were met with a better than expected, in a professional timely manner.
It was the best choice i've made and i'd do it again.
He is very strong with friendly communication, professional attention to detail, timelines, responsiveness to concerns, or anything else.
Ariel gave me what was needed most, "ease of mind" and without doubt, "trust".
In our unique situation, i feel very lucky and confident, that we got the best experienced team possible, "team jessop!"
Ariel, will be my go to guy the next time around.
If asked, i'd say... "go see ariel!"
I trust him and peoples mortgage, for doing such a fantastic, flawless job on our behalf.
Making sure that it was done right.
No surprises and a happy outcome.
Professional and personable integrity.
Kim wolford, san diego, ca.
This branch was exceptionally helpful!
He explained how everything worked and was so nice, and explained that i wouldn't be charged any extra fees.
I won't talk about the 25% interest rate rbc used to rape me.
I guess their service makes up for the ridiculous service fees.
They're getting paid right?!
Vibe  think of a bank.
They got a cool new electronic chalk board for promotions.
It's kind of cool, especially if there's a long wait.
My teller told me about the e-savings account that i can withdraw from at any time without charge.
Of course, i got set up for an appointment to talk about finances.
Obligatory catchy remark  am i being bratty?
But now my savings are automated and i learned some new stuff along the way.
And i'm no longer at a 25% interest rate!
Credit cards are bad.
But seriously, lovely lovely service here.
I been in this location many times.
Their staff has always been super friendly and willing to take care of me.
It's amazing though, i have seen some oddities come in and acting all crazy, riling everybody up.
Who knows of those of the people writing not so good reviews.
I love love love this bank!!!
Everyone who works at this branch is amazing!!
Thank you alex and rana for being such great bankers.
I'll never ever leave this bank!!
One of the last great banks around.
I highly recommend !
Extremely honest folks who truly value your time.
We appreciate the gallegos fully.
We recently moved to the buckeye area from out of state and needed a new bank.
We looked around and decided on us bank.
Upon entering we were greeted immediately by a gentleman who suggested we have a seat.
Within a few minutes a young lady named dalila helped us open our account and we were on our way.
Cathy helped me out here!
She was super nice and friendly.
I would recommend her to anyone.
Last week i needed to wire funds to purchase a home in lv.
Layal safieddine, the relationship manager who handled this transaction for me did an outstanding job.
She carefully entered and confirmed every item on the wiring instructions and the transmission went through without a hitch.
The funds cleared in about an hour and everyone associated with the real estate purchase was happy.
So, i'm giving layal and her branch five stars for the excellent service and experience i received.
I have been with joann for many, many years and have filed multiple claims both small and large.
I appreciate their kindness and the speed in which they have processed my claims.
I have always been treated kindly by joann and her staff.
Just joined yelp but wanted to go back and say how great ryan was when he did our mortgage.
He was referred to us from our real estate agent.
We were on a time crunch because we had to be out of our rental.
Ryan kept us updated proactively throughout the process.
We actually were able to close on our house a week early.
We really were happy and appreciate ryan's hard work.
I hate dealing with banks.
I cannot stress this enough i hate dealing with banks.
But at least this bank has a great manager brendon anytime i have a issue he resolves it fast.
Brandon committed to getting our transaction completed in a very short window and he delivered with time to spare.
I can't say enough about how positive our experience was when working with brandon and his team.
This location has the best customer service.
Every employee is extremely friendly and knowledgeable.
I do wish they would bring back their coin counter though.
Excellent service....happy to help.
Most of the bad reviews are centered around frustration with the insurance company.
Joann is a loyal individual who prides herself not in sales, but offering individuals insurance that works for their family
Brandon greene, state farm agent in east liberty, was extremely helpful and informative.
I was able to clearly understand what my options are and identify the best avenue to take for myself.
I recommend brandon and state farm for all of your insurance needs.
Delayed post from about 30-45 days ago.
For some reason it didn't get on.
I'm glad that branches are still available to where you can talk to somebody in person about your needs.
Because, you cannot always find your answer online.
Or, schedule an appointment for the next day.
Open saturdays until 3 pm- that's convenient.
As you enter, there is an atm to your right side.
Inside, there is a small waiting area with a coffee pot on the desk on your left.
There were three bank tellers wearing the blue shirt uniform with one manager supervising (new trainees?).
I was in line for less than three minutes.
The trainee was courteous and asked if i wanted my balance.
Speedy trip to the bank- nice & easy.
Formerly wamu, there are so many locations of chase bank throughout the city and beyond.
There was no one using the atm outside so it was a quick stop.
I've been coming here for years.
It is right downtown beside concordia, so that might have a lot to do with it.
The good parts, though: the receptionist is amazing and always directs people to the quickest person that can help them.
She's also joked with me a couple times about different things when i make my appointments.
Shes actually one of the reasons this gets such a high rating!
This is a great branch!
The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable.
They take pride in taking care of their customers and making sure to give fast and courteous service.
This review is for the drive-through, as i have not been inside recently.
The tellers are quick and friendly, and i haven't experienced a long line yet!
This place is awesome mary nell is the best.
Well i was financed for the car at a good rate.
She also gave me some of her tamales.
I will be buying my next car here also
Justin vaught is always available to answer questions and provide updated status on our mortgage application.
Additionally, he facilitates a stress free mortgage approval process.
If you need a mortgage, please contact justin.
I'm a loyal customer because they have high interest rates and minimal fees.
When i say minimal, i mean almost none.
The service is friendly and the locations are convenient there is  a branch in most cities in northeast ohio.
The newer building don't have drive throughs but they do have at least 6 teller windows open every day.
I'm a little old fashioned when it comes to my money.
I still go into the bank to get money and cash checks.
It works for me.
I recommend third federal to anyone looking for good service from a responsible bank without a bunch of silly fees.
This is my bank, this is the only one i'll go to in tempe.
And i make sure i go inside because the people are so friendly.
This guy has taken care of me and really saved me money.
I got out of a bad contract with another bank and they really helped me out.
There weren't any of those hidden fees that you have no idea where they come from.
It's just cut and dry.
It was also conveniently located across the street from the desert ridge shopping area.
Not much more i could ask for.
Return factor - 75%
I love this location.
Very small bank that does not have a large amount of traffic.
It is one of the friendliest neighborhood banks in the valley.
He was very knowledgeable about the products which helped me and my business partner make the best decisions.
His level of professionalism was top 10.
I now know more about the services bofa has to offer and a new friend.
Thank you bofa for hiring such wonderful people to represent your organization.
Karen moon and her team are amazing!!
I don't think abby can ever make a mistake...love it!
Thank you amerifirst and karen moon/team for restoring my faith in the mortgage loan process.
You did a wonder job for my family and my realtor, murdoch tignor.
Not sure why there are so many bad reviews of this place.
It is a used car dealer after all, so you know the drill before even going there.
They went over it with a fine toothed comb and deducted for every little thing they could find.
Oh well its too much of a pain for me to try to sell it on my own.
Mitch was professional  and as honest and fair as you could expect a used car salesman to be.
Key is just know what you want going in and they are not trying to rip you off..
I rarely write online reviews but i am very impressed with the customer service at this office.
It was not because he was unavailable.
On the contrary, he is very responsive and helpful...
Epifania always fully understood my complex issues the first time i explained them.
From our various phone conversations, i could tell she was smart and "with it."
The prices were also very reasonable.
They had the lowest rates and best coverage after comparing the major companies in the area.
What can i say...its a bank.
I like bofa because of it's ease of access.
I can find one everywhere.
People are always freindly and they give me my money when i need it.
I've been a very satisfied stearns customer for over 14 years now., and they have never let me down.
The big banks claim to care, but in fact you know they could care less.
I would ignore the one negative comment here as one never knows the circumstances of someone's financial dealings.
The bank itself is usually very slow.
However i must say i was very impressed with antonio sida.
I have been sick and due to illness i had difficulty in getting a payment in.
He helped me with the situation and it was resolved.
I am greatful, in and out, no problems.
I live in san antonio texas and found a audi a4 on car guru.
He was so nice and helpful that it almost made me suspicious.
Being in texas i had to send an auto loan check to hold the car.
Sending a place i had never seen  a 25000 check made me nervous.
Damont was great and assured me of reliable autos integrity and high standards.
He could not have been more right.
They held the car for me for over a month never cashing the check.
When i saw the car yesterday 4/7/15 it exceeded my expectations.
This place is the real deal!!!!
Great deals, great cars and great people.
Hard to believe the 2 bad reviews when i had such a great experience.
There were deals all over the lot and the selection of high end cars was amazing.
As for damont he could not have been nicer and more engaged in helping me purchase this great car.
Excellent and outstanding service from everyone in the branch.
Fresh baked cookies in the morning and hot coffee!
The service my husband and i received from christina crabtree and peoples mortgage company was amazing.
Christina and peoples mortgage company made purchasing the home very easy.
I am very happy with this bank.
Customer service is a top priority the people that work there are knowledgeable and friendly.
Bought my charger here last year and i'm in still in love with it!
The guys there were super cool and i didn't feel any pressure when buying.
They were upfront about what i qualified for vs what i wanted.
But most of all the service dept.
And not no nickle n dime either even with an expired warranty!
Staff is nice and friendly.
Whenever i go here, it's usually during a break from work or on my way home.
They never seem overwhelmed when there is a line, which lends to the overall environment when it's crowded.
Two thumbs up in my book.
If you need a car, please go see doug or harry.
They worked together to make sure everything went smoove with my purchase.
Very convenient location right outside st patricks subway station.
Very down to earth people work there who are very helpful and friendly.
Never a bad experience here!
Leon pearson jr. is what it means to be successful.
His staff is amazing, especially marie.
Marie always takes the time to call or email me regarding any issues i may have.
This location is clean and well maintained.
Leon's office is the far the sweetest office of any insurance agent i've seen (which hasn't been many).
I highly recommend leon pearson jr. and especially marie for your insurance needs.
I am so glad that i opened an account at this credit union!
That's an extra $200 a month saved !
Their customer service was great as well as their follow up!
We had both of the loans done in less than a week signed and checks mailed out !
My representative was yvonne and she was fantastic all around!
Have already referred a few friends and family and will continue to do so!
This is what credit unions are all about !
The man helping was milo.
I was going to setup a business account with chase and his mansplaining was terrible.
I had to leave.
Don't let all of the negative reviews sway you!
No writes about positive experiences, and was my experience more than positive!
I will always work with her whenever i can!
Peoples mortgage has given us a truly great experience as we embarked on the challenge of purchasing our first home.
Most of all, we highly recommend our agent dale pflepsen!
He was patient, sincere, dedicated and we felt he was truly looking out for us.
We can't thank you enough dale for making the entire process easy for us.
We're truly glad we made the right choice going with peoples mortgage!
I went saturday to transfer money from my chase rewards/chase freedom credit card.
I walked from the longhorn to boulder crossroads.
Nothing like good cardio!
Only 2 bankers on duty, while the cubicles were empty.
A lady helped me out by dialing the number to transfer the money to my checking account.
Plus, i needed coffee.
Leelee is amazing at this location.
I have a business account with this bank and we keep it here because of her.
She's so friendly and welcoming.
It's refreshing to deal with her each and everytime i come to the bank.
She always remembers that my daughter likes butterscotch and rootbeer lollipops as well.
Makes my daughter smile everytime we come in.
She is a great face for the bank.
She's wonderful and this bank needs more employees like her.
Thank you for being so great!
I received a flyer offering pretty much the lowest refi rates i could find anywhere.
Most important, there were no gimmicks or games.
The flyer said "lock your rate for only $295.
We pay everything else" & it was just as advertised, with all fees, title insurance, appraisals, etc.
There was always a live customer service rep available during business hours.
Phone calls and e-mails were returned in a reasonable amount of time.
Reps were always pleasant & professional.
Their "my mortgage center" portal was relatively easy to use.
And the closing was painless....a notary came to our house with the settlement package.
I don't think it gets much better than third federal.
It's simple: great people work here!
What a great surprise stumbling across this bank!
I opened both a savings and checking account here.
I'm thinking - here we go again.
But it was one of those think on your feet moments.
Off they went (i'll assume to get approval).
In fact, if you use a non-midfirst bank atm, they will refund you the service fees.
How refreshing with the current state of banking.
The tellers here are good and fairly quick which is always appreciated because people got things to do!
I guess coming on friday wasn't the best idea i've ever had....
Wow was she helpful.
Was never treated this way at chase and she made me feel appreciated for bringing my business to us bank.
Highly recommend this us bank branch and amber the personal banker.
Found this office after talking to a couple other after relocating to the area.
They are amazing compared to any state farm office!!
After working with jessica via email & phone i stopped in to wrap things up & they were so helpful!
They even helped me with a vehicle loan & 401k rollover from a previous job.
Don't waste your time on other state farm offices - this is the best!
The tellers are always pleasant and efficient so i have no complaints.
One of these days....
Parking is not an issue since it's inside the albertson's so there's a huge lot.
And most of the time there is not a line.
They have suckers for the kids.
Unfortunately my grandson knows this.
I received most excellent customerservice here - and im not even a customer!
From the time i walked in the door til the time i left, i was made to feel welcome.
If i decide to get a bank account, itll probably be here.
Kudos to wells fargo for stepping up their game!
Ive been banking with wells fargo since 1996 and i've some minor problems but not much.
I usually only have to go thru the drive thru and that is what this review is about.
Always friendly and fast!!!
Thank you so much for great and kind server with a smile!
I prefer banks that when you go in they know you.
I believe i found that here.
My husband and i opened a checking account with them today.
Shauna was the banker that set up our account.
She was super nice and informative.
The service is always fast and the employees are very friendly.
My one complaint is the parking lot is frequently difficult to navigate.
The drive thru is usually fast and the atm's are easy to get and almost never have a line.
The staff knows me by name, and i notice they know a lot of their patron's names.
They are very friendly and professional, i always feel at home here.
I hope this bank never changes!
I've been using first commonwealth for years and was happy to see the branch in the southside.
Downfall of using first commonwealth in the city is the number of branches / atms.
This branch is delightful!
I have gone in for many things and have always been treated beautifully.
I have had to ask for many notary services and various complicated requests while trying to settle my brother's estate.
Kristin petersen and juan galindo have been especially helpful and have gone to extra lengths in customer service.
Just bought my second car .... a+++++.... would definitely recommend........ going to tell everyone that is looking for a car.....
I feel like i drove away a winner....very happy...both times..... ask for mitch... he is amazing
Weird how some branches can be great and others shitty... must be the management!
This is the branch i use to deposit my company checks.
They are always courteous and fast.
I'm a new wells fargo customer and was trying to get my account going today.
Jennifer rivera (banker) was so helpful and friendly in helping me with my needs.
At least it's all over with and i'm now all good to go with my checking account.
Everyone at this location was so friendly and sweet none the less :)
People here are usually friendly.
Drive through is pretty swift.
You just don't want to leave your car here over night.
Was looking for a new bank that is available everyday and closes later than all the other banks.
Came across midfirst which is an oklahoma base company.
They branched out to arizona.
They have opened many locations within arizona.
Well depends on which location you go to.
It will show on your account initially, but after it officially goes through the fee is taken out.
They have recently partnered with asu and have some cool asu card designs.
One is all black with the fork logo embossed, pretty cool.
When you get any of the asu cards a portion of your purchases goes to the school.
So overall i really like this bank.
I like this cibc as it is conveniently located in bayview village and has an entrance leading to the bank.
It is never overrun, so you can get your day to day banking done without having to wait.
Danny and alex are amazing!
After 30 days i had my house.
If looking for people that speak spanish, danny is the man.
I truly cannot thank him enough for making this a successful experience.
Reliable auto was great!
We worked with salesman charlie who heard what we wanted and found us the car we were looking for.
My car now runs excellent with no issues!!
Thy definitely have wonderful customer service
As a business owner, a good working relationship with your bank is key.
At duca i've been treated like a human, not a statistic.
Thats the way it should be.
I'm giving the joint the 5 star treatment !!
First world problems folks!!!
Put on your big girl panties and suck it up!!!
That's my 5 cents.
It's worth exactly what you paid for it!!
Went through the drive through today for the first time, fast service.
Could have been a little bit faster since there was only 1 guy working.
Would go back if i ever needed a bank close to me to use.
This is review is for 'those 2 loan guys', david butcher and albie anderman..and their awesome assistant lacy!
So much boring financial information, packed into awesome videos..i still cannot get over how cool that all was!
This was fast efficient and direct!
They kept all things honest and on the table.
They guided on what was necessary to make things move along.
It was a wonderful experience and they really wanted to help you!
I recommend  them anytime!!!
Sharon layman state farm agency is absolutely amazing!!
They have helped me with some complicated situations over the last five plus years.
I'll even get e-mails outside of business hours with follow up to my questions.
If you're looking for insurance, vehicle loans/mortgages or even investing options - call this place!
Sharon is completely a midwest gal & her team is the best!
I've had an account with arizona central credit union for years and i love them.
They have excellent customer service and low fees.
Anyway, i've never had a single issue with azccu.
What keeps me coming back....my mortgage payment!
Since i've started going back here on a regular basis i havent been pressured into opening up another account.
The have saturday hours from 9 to 4 which definetly is a plus.
First of all this bank is very close to my home.
Which makes it most good!!
2ndly they are always very friendly.
This comes from those working on the side lines.
This is the only bank i have  ever seen do this.
Every one here is very helpful and very friendly.
They will print up your statements even no charge.
Extra parking in bank.
It is located right on the corner.
Good choice if you are in tempe.
This location is quite unique.
They have the typical drive through teller windows.
Then, they have walk up teller windows inside.
You can't see the teller, but you can pick up the phone to speak with them.
They handle your transaction the same way they do at the drive through window.
I didn't know these existed.
I stopped in for a card replacement.
That was handled promptly and i was on my way.
She went out of her way to make my experience less stressful and the best experience possible.
I would recommend peoples mortgage.
Been with boa for over 10 years now.
I have no complaint what so ever.
The app is user friendly.
Transferring money takes seconds.
And whenever i come here, everyone is so friendly with with huge smiles.
Yall deserve this 5 star.
They have great rates on loans for members and many quality services, which should really be called 'conveniences'.
The staff is always friendly and professional.
They have two very convenient locations, one in champaign, off of john st. near centennial h.s.
And one in urbana.
I have banked there for years and will continue to so.
Such a sweetheart and will help in anyway she can!
I know, its amazing that a used car dealership stands by its word.
So far, so good.
Good service at every branch i've visited (wt harris, sunset, huntersville, central avenue).
Parking is large, personnel fantastically friendly and professional!
Thank you mitch for the awesome experience of buying a car.
I am very happy with my purchase.
Will definitely be referring my friends and family to you!
I arrived here on a saturday, 13 minutes before their 1pm closing time.
Turned out that the physical branch can't do it either; they had to call huntington's hub in ohio.
And the specific department they were trying to reach turned out to be closed on saturday.
And indeed, they called me on monday and said everything was taken care of, that my card was activated.
This is the best bank i've ever had.
The employees are always so nice.
There is plenty of parking and you never have to wait long in line, if there is a line.
Great bank for my business account.
It's nice that it's close to my salon and has an atm outside so that i can make late deposits.
Most of the atm's are inside grocery stores and i don't like that.
Overall a great experience at this branch.
We'll definitely be doing business at this branch from here on.
Great job....keep up the good work guys.
I read the two earlier comments on here.
I agree there are a couple of weaknesses at this branch.
Ya the cheques take forever - but the cheque company is d&h which isn't scotiabank.
I've had problems with d&h as well.
Also, whenever i had to deposit a us cheque, they hold my cheques for 20 days also.
It's an amercian cheque.
That's just what happens at any bank when you deposit a cheque from a different country.
That doesn't bother me.
I will agree though that their phone tree system sucks a bit.
Alot actually - sometimes after you've been on hold forever.
And you do get passed around sometimes for sure.
The 2nd time, she even guffed at me (!!!)
Apparently, she was the only person in the world who could release this hold.
He's cool, sharp, and actually cares about my accounts.
I do find the tellers at this location are very friendly.
I especially like one lady who was transferred there for my old branch at adelaide and spadina.
When i remember her name i'll add it here.
I've tried other banks, and so far i'm sticking with scotiabank.
Lou and greg have been helped me a lot for the past two months.
Especially lou,i cant tell you how nice she is,and how much i thankful her .
I love this ds location.
The staff is extremely friendly and will ensure that you're satisfied with the services they provide.
I've never had a bad experience here.
If you're looking for a credit union, this is the one.
Not only is the insurance fantastic, but everyone in the office is as well.
If you need insurance, don't go to one of those fly by night joints.
You get what you pay for.
This place will treat you like family, without costing you an arm and a leg.
I have multiple accounts and they are very polite and helpful with all of my questions and banking needs.
The best loan service i've ever experienced.
In this era of loan complexities and hoops to jump through, peoples mortgage, specifically shelley williams, were outstanding.
From the first phone call, they were efficient, responsive, and thorough.
I highly recommend them.
Chad s. was great with taking care of my banking in a super fast manner.
These are great people.
This company is exactly what i needed to find for my clients.
Ricky khamis did an amazing job of educating my buyers and keeping the loan on track throughout the whole process.
They were professional and friendly the whole way through.
It was a great experience!
Hey wells fargo put up a free standing atm around taylor place or the mall/walkway at the journalism building.
I was helped by joanna, super nice and very professional.
Definitely impressed with the customer service.. thank you joanna morris .
I've had multiple loans with this institution, and wouldn't consider looking elsewhere.
I received nearly instant call-backs and email replies to questions and concerns.
This company has specialized in residential mortgage loans for decades, and it shows in their service level.
Mark helped me set up my new account.
He was very nice and explained everything.
He answered all my questions and made the whole process easy.
So far so good.
This is a newer bank of america branch, conveniently located off of i-17 and bell.
There are drive thru and walk up atm's, and the customer service is excellent.
The seating area in the lobby is comfortable and the branch in general is nice and bright.
Some of the older locations are a little darker, which can seem less welcoming.
I have always had friendly and helpful tellers at this branch and the hours are amazing!
I am a mom and a business owner so later evening and and weekends are a lifesaver.
I have an idea as to how i think they should work as a member owned cooperative (of a sort).
My wife and adult son moved their accounts there as well.
I wish i had moved to cicu years ago.
Cicu is small in space and assets on deposit but have been around many many decades!
Like any credit union in illinois member's deposits are insured by the federal government.
Cicu has about five full-time staff and they know their clients.
They provide personal attention and take care of my banking needs very well (so far).
I do most of my banking online.
Fees for accounts and services are free or very low.
My banking needs are pretty simple and the size of cicu is a great fit for me.
If you are shopping for a place to do your banking pay them a visit!
You will sit down and talk with the president or vice president of the cu to get your questions answered.
There are only a few things i expect from a bank:  - keep the lines moving.
- keep the process simple.
- don't charge me any unnecessary fees.
- get it right the first time.
I've been to this particular location a couple of times and they have met my requirements each visit.
The staff is friendly and it's a quick in/out.
As with many businesses in greenfield - chain or local - the service and friendliness is top notch.
Had an amazing car buying and selling experience at reliable auto sales!
They played no games and were up front and very help full during my visit.
I was very happy with the offer and decided to sell my truck to them.
I would recommend reliable auto to any one in the vegas market.
I typically shop at the shoppers drug mart that is within the same oddly designed strip mall.
On saturday, i needed to deposit some money in my chequing account and decided to pay this location a visit.
This cibc is located across from menchies, which i have frequented once.
I got a prime parking spot and made my way inside the branch.
I held the door for an older gentleman.
He thanked me and we had a brief conversation.
I liked it, as it makes you feel like it's a small neighbourhood of folks looking out for one another.
This branch has four atms.
No waiting at all.
Both the gentleman and i did our banking there, along with an existing customer pressing away at the screen.
This branch is huge and inviting!
It makes me want to call this branch my home one.
Top notch customer service!
The best bank in town.
The tellers are friendly and helpful.
The bankers truly​ go above and beyond to take good care of their customers.
Helpful customer service folks and even extra people on duty when the atm was down.
If only the real estate aspect of chase was as good as the banking side.
I love banking here.. going to be moving a car loan over here..
I treat this as my home td branch and have opened several accounts here.
The lines seem to move very quickly yet they manage to be friendly and accommodating to the regular customers.
I like td because of its numerous abm machines and convenient hours.
I've also invested in their mutual funds, which have a good rating.
Awesome bank in a safeway.
The hours are wonderful as they are open everyday, including sunday!
Good customer service everytime i come here.
I'd recommend desert schools as a credit union.
Not just a bank it's a building that has suites with different business.
I have to make several trips to this building at least once a month.
Other than the parking situation it's a nice building with a mini cafe inside for light snacks and coffee.
Really couldn't have asked for a smoother process.
From application through close, the communication was excellent and we were treated like we were very important customers.
After getting a pre-purchase inspection, we bought a maserati and loved the entire experience.
Danny gave the ok for final pricing and he was a really nice guy too.
Amazing service start to finish.
Brandon and his team closed out loan in less than 30 days.
Great job all around.
Will use them again for all our future mortgages.
This location is very much open and awesome!!!
Debbie padilla was super helpful and very friendly!
Been a customer for about 15 years, this company helped me build the high credit that i have now.
This location has never been rude to me and always helpful.
Easy to dispute fraud if it happens, cards are delivered quick, and great rates for car loans that i've needed.
She is very friendly, courteous and efficient.
The new branch manager nancy is also pleasant and would always greet the customers if she is in the lobby.
The branch location is easy to get to and one side benefit is next to supermarket and great restaurants.
The application and underwriting process needs some work, that's for sure.
It took over two months for my loan to close.
I would have given them 2 stars if you had asked me 6 months ago, but they've grown on me.
I don't have to go through those incredibly painful call routing systems.
-- everyone i've spoken to has always been very pleasant.
-- their "smart loans" with rate re-locks just work!
I just refinanced without a credit pull, application, or appraisal.
If this ain't "consumer friendly" then i don't know what is.
My rating is really a 3.5, but i rounded up.
For them to truly get the extra half star, they'll need to allow me to manage my loan online!
I mean, it's 2016, for goodness sake.
She saved me from paying over $100 in fees from having cheque copies made and looked for.
I'm really grateful for that.
I'll be honest, i hate going to the bank.
But as far as banks go, this place is top notch.
The staff is professional and courteous.
The service is always a step above.
If you have to bank (and we all do), you might as well bank here.
She chatted happily with me while she was opening my account and the time flew.
I was in and out before i new it!
This is our go-to bank whenever we eat at the nearby chipotle/etc.
We've never had any problems and the atm always works.
Their deposit machines always seem to be up as well.
The customer service at wells fargo continues to amaze me.
This is the first time that i visited this branch.
I usually go to the wf down the road, but ended up here today to have a cashiers check made.
Immediately upon entering, i received a "welcome to wells fargo" greeting by a smiling, friendly employee.
I was asked if i need help from a banker.
Went to the window where i was greeted by another smiling face.
The teller was friendly, helpful and efficient.
I've completely converted from the credit union to wf for my banking needs.
The customer service can't be beat!
I have never encountered a problem with summit credit union as a whole or this waunakee branch in particular.
They go above and beyond to get to know their guests.
It's amazing what satisfaction you can experience when you understand the rules of banking and loans and actually follow them.
Read the contract, sign the contract, live by the contract.
My dog peed on their carpet...  and they were completely calm and professional about it.
I came in to refinance my house and had great friendly service even for a huge banking institution.
They even had doggy treats as well.
Ultimately there is nothing they had to offer for homes for refinancing, but they were very friendly.
The building has a very interesting modern look which is not typical of a banking institution.
Clean, short wait times, and friendly and efficient staff.
Not sure the hate in the other review is even relevant..but all-in-all a great chase locatoin in south scottsdale.
They even have dum-dum suckers for the kiddos (or kid at heart...yeah...i took one)
I love christina's review, but wanted to add that the bank is inside of a grocery store.
Wish it would say that on the search.
Thank you leon for my insurance needs since i was 18 years old.
Thank you for all your years of service
My man david helped me get a lower rate on my insurance.
Not only that but every time i call they always greet me in a polite manner.
Such a breath air to receive great customer service on a day when everything else is going wrong.
The financial advisors here are awesome.
But.. bank of america is trying to force costumers out of the branch and onto the app.
Two dozen people in line and two tellers...
This is a great pnc branch!
Everyone is friendly, courteous, and knowledgeable about the services that they can offer.
She's been with pnc for 35 years and is a real delight to work with.
Every time i walk in this branch, i feel proud to be a pnc client!
I am usually a very busy person especially when i am on my lunch break taking care of things.
So when i went into this branch, i was greeted right away and asked what i needed help with.
The teller who helped me was fast, didn't ask me unnecessary questions and knew exactly what i needed.
Also the candy jar was plenty full for me to take a couple.
I plan on going here a lot since it is within walking distance of my job.
The teller also showed me new features of their atm.
It's had it's ups and downs but lately it has had some pretty good people going through here.
Gordon phong the last bank manager was great, really nice, and easy going.
Recently they changed their branch manager to tom ing who is also very sharp, friendly and knowledgeable.
We have several accounts with this bank and have always referred our business and friends over.
They also have a decent loan program for home mortgages but the process time is the same for most banks.
I would definitely recommend this branch, it's also very conveniently located near 168 supermarket for some shop and go.
So if you ever want to open up a td bank account, then come here and bank with derek ng.
He will guarantee your banking satisfaction and is a very honest and reliable person.
Quick service and helpful staff on a monday.
Out of all the wells fargos that i have been to this is the branch that i love.
They really take the time to make you happy and usually waves any fees that you have gotten.
Every other branch that i have been to i have had some bad experiences.
But going to this branch has given me faith in the banking industry
This branch is always very professional from their tellers to bankers.
Everyone seems to be educated on the services they are to provide.
There's never more than a two minute wait for you to be assisted which is awesome, even on a friday!
Major props to ed for helping us out.
Bought 2 new work trucks from them today and their team made the process easy and pain free.
We will be future customers for sure.
Highly recommend scott wiley's services.
Absolutely the best in the business for your mortgage needs.
Great experience with doug and his entire team.
Always on top of our loan and closed on time.
This location has always been great for me.
The manager is super nice and has taken time for me when i have questions or need some financial direction.
I am surprised by the bad reviews!
From the states and travelling?
This bank is all over so you can hit the atm and more easily track your withdrawals.
The fee was 3$ cad each time.
Never had trouble with exchange.
Made it way more simple than trying to exchange usd for cad.
Very friendly staff, sometimes the wait at the drive through teller is longer than if you walk in.
They have a walk up atm and a separate drive through atm.
This has saved me money on several occasions.
Not that this is a review of wells fargo the company, but i love their on-line bill pay!
Who needs stamps any more??!?
I think i still have christmas stamps from like 2 years ago!
Every teller is nice and i never wait long in line.
Manager shauna is awesome!!!
In checking acct or 5000$ combined w savings and checking.
I fell to 1400$ for a cpl days but my avg daily balance was over 4000$ and was charged!
Home mortgage department was awesome.
Tarek worked hard to get us closed by months end.
Kept in good contact and communication.
My husband and i were provided banking services by mark delacruz.
We were treated promptly, kindly and expediently to handle our banking needs.
I would recommend mark due to his extraordinary knowledge and overall customer service in handling our banking needs.
Ive been to other banks in the area and most of them stink.
This one was very friendly in large part due to the customer service rep, shauna.
She was very pleasant & helpful.
I visit this location about 3 times a week and i am always pleased with the friendless of the tellers.
They are quick and efficient, never have had am issue.
Didn't think i would be able to get an account at all.
And i was approved.
The process was quick and he was just flat out awesome with customer service.
So happy i joined at this branch.
This is my branch and they are very friendly.
There can be long waits in line, mostly because of business owners of bloomfield i suspect.
But with this kind of service it's worth the wait.
Without going into all my banking details.
Alex s. provides great customer service and as a man of his word.
Help me through a process when the atm ate my funds.
Without going into all my banking details.
Alex s. provides great customer service and is a man of his word.thank you alex for being such great banker.
I love love love this bank!!!
Everyone who works at this branch is amazing!!
I'll never ever leave this bank!!
I've been a dsfcu member for many years.
Everyone i had contact with, both in person and on the phone, responded professionally and courteously.
Kudos desert schools, keep up the good work!
I never have to wait in a long line and the associates at this location are very helpful and efficient.
Thanks for being there for all my banking needs ladies.
Thank you so much!
Happy new customer, michael
Convenient location right next to the 24 hour gym and zipps sports grill.
They hold my money so that's good.
I have had a banking relationship with stearns bank for years.
I have nothing but good things to say about the bank.
Even though john mistler is no longer with the bank, i worked with him on many occasions.
The current banking staff are polite, professional and there to help the customer.
I appreciate the fact that they know my name and are always warm and friendly.
It is the way banking should be!
Chuck west was knowledgeable, responsive, and approachable.
The mortgage application process was very stressful for me but he made it manageable by being reassuring and confident.
I always felt that he was on my side.
I highly recommend him, especially for people who prefer to work with a real person rather than a faceless company.
I financed my ipl.
Equipment with paramount financial services,the person who helped me in the whole process is drew kabo.
Drew is a very professional ,very helpful and friendly person.
Set up everything and anticipated my needs so my questions were answered before i even had them.
And they took care of issues i didn't even think of.
The process was seamless, even when i was out of town.
He had everything done in advance and we were even able to close early.
If you want white glove service with the best rates look here first.
I really felt i had an ally on my side and couldn't have asked for a better experience.
I love this office.
Any time i need anything they get it to me quickly.
They are also so friendly.
This company is great we used karen moon two times when we purchased our homes.
She is very quick and thorough on closing dates ect.
Her team is very responsive and informative.
I would recommend her to anyone!
Their service department was really awesome.
Mike c gave great customer service and along with jose, they were both very helpful and attentive.
As for the sales department, they too are very helpful in providing us the right car for my daughter.
Kudos to meryem, charlie, and dave for the best car service i have ever experienced.
I definitely recommend this place.
I have had good customer service here from the tellers the couple times i've been here.
They even waived my fee for a cashier's check.
It was only $5, but i'll take it.
My only complaint is that the decor looks so industrial and cold.
I would hate to work there.
I know it's a credit union and not a cozy boutique, but something about it is really unappealing to me.
The layout is just off to me.
Very convenient located in the target/kohl's shopping center on blue diamond.
Working downtown, it's convenient, and the staff has always been really pleasant and helpful!
Otherwise, the lines move pretty quickly and the layout is nice, open, and easy to navigate.
If you're a pnc customer downtown, i highly recommend this branch!
I highly recommend this place .
Mary nell was very helpful with my car purchase.
I felt welcome and at ease going to reliable auto sales.
There was no haggling which i appreciated.
I asked immediately to give me the out the door price and she did.
No sales pitch whatsoever.
It is a "reliable" place to go get your new vehicle.
Conveniently located at nec of 7th st and mcdowell and just north of the i-10.
Now if they could only make getting out of the parking lot during rush hour any easier!
Ann mountz was a awesome rep to work with!
I spent a little over two years working with her throughout my loan and qualifying process.
She has always been straightforward in letting me know exactly what was needed.
I'm thankful this month we finally closed on our new home, and it's all because of ann.
One nevada credit union and financial service representative dawn craig, awesome!!!!
I transferred all of my accounts from chase, which offers poor customer service at most local branches.
The branch members are very helpful.
Dawn made my experience painless while taking her time to focus on me.
She was patient while setting up my account.
I even got my online account set up before leaving the branch.
I have honestly had nothing but exceptional service each time i've visited this branch.
I have used several locations and have been very happy with each one but this one takes the cake.
Great bank great employees!
Feel like i am wanted when i come here.
Everything is also super quick
Best place, best costomer service, best finances, is   best vehicle .
On the website they have discounted cash price.
What else would i want.
Thank you reliable auto sales
Undoubtedly the most honest and thorough sale i've ever been involved in when it comes to purchasing a car.
Mitch was open from the beginning of our interaction to the signing my contract.
I appreciate that especially being new to las vegas.
I'd recommend anyone, of any age, buying level to check them out!
You won't be disappointed.
We know that a loan/escrow process is a trying time for everyone concerned, namely the loan officer and the applicants.
We had the pleasure of doing business with mr. roger cain.
From the very onset my wife and i felt very comfortable  and confident with  mr. cain.
His demeanor, professionalism, knowledge and experience gave us the composure and trust we needed throughout the nerve-wrecking process.
People with highly polished work-ethics are a rare breed these days.
Mr. cain is at the top of the list when it comes to work ethic.
Personal commitment and going beyond the work hours are his unspoken personal  "mission statement".
I am a retired police sergeant but still a good judge of character.
I was not wrong about mr. cain.
It is often said that the good lord sends us " angels in disguise"...mr. cain wore his well.
Thank you mr. cain and everyone at people's mortgage who made our dream come true.
Sincerely, frank & yolanda espejo.
What a busy branch but the line moved fairly quickly.
They were very helpful in getting a task accomplished for me on behalf of my client.
This is the best bank in town.
The customer service is incredible.
I switched over from allstate where i had been with agent for about 20 yrs.
Gave my allstate an opportunity to match it, but he couldn't come close.
I have a good record with no accidents and i worked with jennifer w. from chris' office.
I've called numerous times about different things and always gotten great customer service.
Every 6 months my policy would go up a little though i have no accidents or claims.
Not sure why that is or inflation or what.
Anyway, they are always courteous and professional when i call and they seem to have good business dealings.
Educated us on all of our options.
We were quickly approved and closed on the property!
Great location, top notch service and products.
Lines move quickly and you can also get assistance with applying for a home loan and credit cards.
Key bank is great!
Their silver mm account pays atm fees and more.
If you have a job, keybank's benefits are great.
Great advice finding us the right policy to suit our needs.
Husband and i learned a lot from sharon and taylor over conference call.
It was a painless process.
They were friendly and very knowledgeable.
Our only regret is that we didn't do this sooner.
We actually didn't even know this existed.
Ask them to help you before you have another birthday.
The views that this place has  oh my...oh my!
I showed up at 9:30am and was wisked upstairs for 10:30am tour.
The final room was just a waiting room in the middle of the north end of the building.
Definitely would go out of the way to see this for sure.
Parking options are a couple of lots underground with some street parking as well.
If you have the chance...don't question it, just go and check the building out.
Gregory was very kind and helpful!
Worked very hard to make us happy and get within our budget.
Tucked away off the main road and next to the university.
Found it in my gps.
Atm available as well as full service during open hours.
I went in to the bank today to cash a check from an out of town friend.
Thank you, bobbie haley, for the friendliest service i've received at a bank in a long time.
Though i was simply cashing a check, you made it a pleasure.
I recently purchased a vehicle from this dealership.
It provided awesome customer service and i was being greatly very well.
I love the vehicle and has no problem driving back to arizona.
I am in the process of switching from skank of america so i opened an account here.
A very refreshing banking experience
I think i have finally found my 'home' with a bank.
I have been with wells fargo for 4 years.
Here is my list of postitives and negatives.
- awesome savings plans.
I love this feature.
Negatives: - you have to have your account number (not your debit card number) when you call.
And have been satisfied.
I won't name the bank but they were opening customer accounts without the customer's knowledge.
So far i am very impressed by midfirst and their employees.
I get exceptionally friendly and knowledgeable service.
They don't stalk you in the lobby and their greetings seem genuine.
We have bought 2 cars from this place and their service is great!
The finance manager dave is sooo nice and accommodating and the sales rep mitch is the best.
He's so honest, caring and really helps you find what you're looking for.
Was there for a long time but i'm very happy with both cars we purchased!
When i was exploring an equity loan (time to replace windows), i did a lot of online research.
Citibank's rates were ridiculously high, and the second tier lenders all had mixed reviews.
I had one of the best financial reps i've ever had the pleasure of working with (great job christina.caraballo!)
And yes, i do have solid credit and easy documentation.
Maybe that's the secret sauce, but i have to give third federal my highest marks!
Absolutely love chase bank!
The staff is always friendly, kind and helpful.
I've been in the bank on three separate occasions in the last two weeks and mario exceeded my expectations.
Good job chase keep up the great customer service.
There was a very professional greeting when we entered, and was shown to a personal banker right away.
Our personal banker was again, professional and was able to take care of our needs promptly.
This was a very good visit!
The whole process went as fast as i supplied documentation.
They made it easy to interact with them - for data, documents and questions.
I was skeptical that their distance from us (chicago to cleveland) could be an obstacle, it never was.
I'd recommend them in a heartbeat again.
I've been a cmcu customer for about a year now and could not be happier with the service.
I will never do business again with a traditional bank.
We have been with azccu for over 16 years and have ultimately been satisfied with the service.
Definitely a more personalized experience than some larger banks.
We have had several auto loans with them and very happy with the low interest rates.
I would recommend them to anyone.
The process of the getting a home equity loan was lengthy but eventually it was approved.
They called the police, as she wouldn't tell them who she was and why she was there.
In fact, she was quite rude to them.
Fortunately, the house did appraise high enough to allow me to get the loan.
I can see why - he's friendly and extremely knowledgable about cars, but is not pushy.
Even though i didn't find the car i was looking for on this trip, i'd recommend checking this place out.
This store is always adequately staffed to customer demands.
The bank tellers are extremely friendly and although they work efficiently, i never feel rushed.
The location inside and out is sparkling clean, warm and inviting.
The crew here is awesome!
They've helped me with several issues that other branches say they're isn't an answer.
Leila haag and her staff are the very best.
Very happy with my loan officer ryan.
Yes he's that good.
Friendly and fast service.
There's an atm at the drive through, near entrance and inside the store.
Tellers are quick and there's also mortgage and investment specialists on site.
Shaun bernaldo-lujan was extremely helpful and polite.
This is my favorite location.
Thank you for the excellent customer service!
We worked with justin, kathy, and team to purchase our home.
We were absolutely happy with our experience.
Despite a snag in the appraisal process, justin's team managed to close our loan on time.
As a side bonus, everyone we dealt with was very friendly.
We have recommended the company to our family and friends, and would use them again in the future.
Loved working with ryan and movement mortgage.
I was kept notified of all aspects of the loan and what was coming up next.
Quick and completely painless experience for all involved.
I highly recommend ryan cramer.
I couldn't get any help from the loan company or chase customer service on the phone.
He has talked to countless people from chase and and the loan company to find where my money is.
I was so frustrated before coming in, i felt like no one wanted to help me or understood.
Jim has been the most helpful person i have encountered in a very long time.
If the manager would do this for me, then his staff would do this for you too.
Very easy and efficient atm's.
Also chase is probably the best bank you can bank with.
They have saved me from fraud on two separate occasions now.
I am in the loan signing business.
Most borrowers are upset by the long arduous process- having said that.
This refi could not have been easier and stress free.
Their closing costs are lower than any .
They asked me for 3 items which i uploaded the their site.
This office has great customer service.
I had a few questions regarding my insurance and they were very eager to help.
I have dealt with david on several occasions and he has always been a true professional.
I would recommend this agency to any of my friends or family.
They are good people.
I have had a mortgage with third federal for almost two years now.
If you bank with chase, you receive complimentary notary services, and that was delivered without a hassle.
And, when we needed copies, the reply was, "no problem."
This team was amazing and did an outstanding job communicating throughout our loan process!!
Thank you so much for your hard work and making this process so smooth.
The tellers and bankers at this location are friendly and helpful.
English is not my dad's first language.
He sometimes has difficulties with understand all the jargon and technical terms.
The personal banker was willing to answer all his questions and walk him through the paperwork.
Ryan made the home buying process a breeze!
He got us a great rate and we were able to close within 30 days of signing the purchase contract.
Ryan was always readily available by phone or email with the answers to all of our questions.
I would definitely recommend ryan cramer at movement mortgage and their in-house underwriting service.
These are good people here they have my future business.
I have read many negative reviews about third federal.
I am writing my review to help customers nervous about the process.
While the process is not over for me, so far it has been great.
I walked into the branch in mentor in late june and sat down with gail.
She actually took all of my information right there and got the process rolling.
She was very helpful in explaining the process.
I did all of this the next day.
At this point it said i was in the processing stage.
They sent an appraiser to my house who did a thorough evaluation of my property in and out.
It is nerve-wracking waiting for appraisal to come back because you do not know what it will be.
They simply evaluate the house for the bank.
They get paid regardless of whether the house appraises at a certain value or not.
I waited for the appraisal to come in and the appraisal was fine.
There was roughly 78% ltv which i thought and hoped there would be.
I called gail who explained that it was going to underwriting from this point.
It took less than a week in underwriting.
It now says i am in the closing stage.
I had to sign off electronically on one more thing per the underwriter's conditions which i did.
Now i am in the closing stage which is just the home stretch from what i was told.
They just have to get the pay off for the old loan and get the title work in order.
Currently i have only great things to say about third federal.
I will keep you updated when it closes or if there turns out to be any problems.
I would highly recommend using third federal at this point.
A few tips: remember, the appraisal has nothing to do with them.
Your credit score has nothing to do with them.
Your income to debt is your own doing.
Finally, your income, current job, and employment history also are up to you.
Excellent service from bianca of 1st ave wf.
I couldn't get through to wf fiesta for 2 days and she gave them a message for me.
They actually called to say they received my message.
I needed to cancel a $150 drilling to safety deposit box and didn't know until 1/2 hr.
Before that appt that someone was aware.
I also e'd and fax'd fiesta wf* with no response!!
They* definitely need to get their phone system into the 20th century.
Ryan was able to help us boost our score and get in on the historically low rates now available.
Thanks, ryan, you saved us a bunch of money!
I love coming here, they are always willing and ready to help you or answer question you may have
I don't typically go to the bank unless it's to the drive thru atm.
However i went in recently, and was fortunate to have come across an incredibly helpful representative named sara.
She was very professional, truly listened to my concerns and provided as many options possible.
Her customer service and people skills were above and beyond.
Hands down the best experience i've had at this location.
I had a great experience with tod hale via the car buying program at azfcu.
At first i told him i wanted a used car and gave him my list of specs.
He started working on it immediately and came back with several options.
He was very patient and his communication was excellent throughout the process.
Because cls partners with azfcu, the loan paperwork was a breeze.
I never set foot in a dealership.
I have already recommended tod to several friends.
A very close friend of mine banks at abt-arizona bank and trust.
He recently had an accident and his car was totaled.
We were in a real pickle.
Earl was equally understanding and apologetic but explained his hands were also tied.
Our special thanks to brent, earl and ken!
The customer service at this location is the best!
Every one is super nice, helpful and efficient!
Easiest time i've ever had opening an account.
Quick, informative should be the motto.
I love this bank!
Great location in a magoo walmart.
I'm leaving the 5-star review as-is but want to share a couple of experiences from the past two days.
Luckily, it's been good for me outside of this one incident.
Today i went to a kiosk and dealt with an absolutely fantastic employee!
She was friendly, personable, helpful, efficient, and took care of everything i needed her to.
If basing my overall experience with pcf on this interaction, i would rate it 5-stars.
Had really excellent experience with one nevada mortgage department.
Very straightforward, fast and convenient.
We come here almost everyday for our business service.
The place is usually very busy during week days.
But we have never had any problem w their customer service.
The managers, all the staffs are very friendly n helpful.
They always make us  feel  great and they take care of us very well  every time we visit.
She is super kind, informative and professional.
This is the only way to buy a car!
Tod hale is fantastic.
He is super friendly, honest and easy to work with.
We have to purchase a car for our daughter next and will reach out to tod to help us.
He was super nice and personal.
Lindsey was very nice and tried to be as helpful as she could.
She was amazing in every aspect.
She was so patient and so helpful.
She made me feel like i was dealing with a friend that i knew for a long time.
My wife and i were first time home buyers and sergio made the process easy and practically effortless.
Thank you again sergio- i will recommend you to anyone looking to purchase a home!
I've been a member 12 years and they always provide great service with low loan rates.
Linda is awesome always helpful.
Always professional and gives the best advice on what the best course of action is.
(some people only text or email)
In my time, i've learned that to be true.
Recently, after some difficulties, azfcu reached out to me to help.
That means the world to me.
Wish interest paid was better, but over all a great bank and on line service.
I think this bank is great for the most part.
I pay many of my bills, send and receive e-transfers, and earn interest on my money.
It is so easy and there seem to be cibc   atms and loblaws stores everywhere i turn.
And were very courteous.
I accepted the new card, spent 350.00 on groceries and cancelled the card.
Shout out to tom walker in investments and the personal bankers.
They are great with customers and advice.
I wouldn't buy a vehicle any other way.
We are 8 time repeat customers at centennial, and twice purchased with cameron walter.
I tell everyone i know they're wasting their time and money if they're not buying a vehicle this way.
Cameron is so awesome he even delivered our most recent purchase to our home.
Clark has been my state farm agent for over 25 years, and he is the best.
His office staff is terrific also.
But it is well worth it when you have a claim or need assistance.
When you have start farm, you have a relationship with your agent and they are there for you anytime, 24/7.
100% five star rating for clark and his crew!
Park behind and in front of starbucks for a sure parking spot then head over to crackbucks for crack.
This is my local branch and i have had nothing but good service whenever needed.
Parking is great and it is just a couple doors from starbucks which is my favorite morning destination.
Awesome and clean new location for one nevada.
The bank peoplw here have a strong sense of hospitality which is friggin awesome!!
I recommend blanca ramirez as she helped me with a car loan.
Best bank ever & vanessa is awesome super nice !
Ask for her when you go in she'll give you great service !
Thanks for the that- resorts a little hope in big banks!
I recently opened up a couple of accounts for my business at this branch with chris morris, the branch manager.
Chris made everything extremely easy for me.
I am looking forward to a strong relationship with comerica in the years to come!
This is my go-to chase.
It's near home and in a shopping center i frequent.
I always use the atm for all my banking needs.
When i have been inside to speak with a personal banker, i have never seen lines though!
The atm takes checks as well cash for deposit with no use of a deposit slip.
Parking can be tight at certain times, but it is a busy shopping center.
After hours you will need your chase card to enter and make any type of transaction at the atm.
I have been a member for over 20 years and in general they have provided very good service.
The location at scottsdale road and frank lloyd wright is very very good
Got my new card in the mail already, definitely very happy so far!!
Thank you us bank for being better than the other big names!!
This branch has the greatest customer service.
From my personal accounts to my business accounts the staff here goes out of their way to be helpful.
He made some great suggestions and even shared his vacation photos with me.
Super nice professional employees.
I highly recommend this branch for great personal service.
I'm a true skeptic but am now sold.
He's talks to you at your level and answers freely any questions you may have.
I love my new jeep!!
The staff this location is so friendly and professional.
I would like to commend jamie ward for caring and loving personality.
She is definitely about the customers.
Thanks for your help.
Changed my insurance over to state farm.
Eric james was so helpful and prices were awesome!
Suzie drinkwine is the best .
She works hard to close any car loan and goes above and beyond .
Ask for suzie drinkwine for any of ur needs .
I go through the drive through quite often since they don't have a drive up atm.
The staff is always so polite and nice.
Super courteous and friendly.
Always asking how i'm doing and smiling.
Very good customer service here and very fast at completing the transactions.
Came to this location after realizing that another nearby branch was closed for remodeling.
We arrived on a sunday, moments after they opened.
Two ladies, including the manager, were working and doing a great job at keeping the line moving.
She quickly got us signed up, and even mentioned some great benefits to having an account with us bank.
She walked us through everything that we needed to know.
Very happy with us bank, particularly this branch.
She helped make the process smooth and easy.
My boyfriend and i opened a one checking rewards account tonight with suzie drinkwine.
What i liked most about suzie was her personality.
She was welcoming and very friendly.
There are no hidden fees like other banks have.
I'm glad and proud to finally be a member of a trustworthy credit union.
Curt is very reliable.
He's answered calls for emergencies very promptly and professional.
The office staff is very honest and clear with suggestions.
I recommend this agency.
This location is across from the unlv in the same parking lot as einstein bros. bagel and the post office.
Friendly and helpful staff  cons:  1.
Super busy all the time!
Parking at this location is almost none.
I've always been greeted by someone very friendly and usually helped within minutes.
I'm usually in and out within 5-10 minutes.
But be ready to wait some if you come during rush hours.
Overall, a great location!
I wish all banks and credit unions across the country were warm and friendly as the staff at nellis afb!!!
The service was absolutely impeccable!!
A special thank you to deb flores who provided me the utmost customer service!!!
Her professionalism, patience & compassion made my visit a memorable one.
Oh and i can't forget the amazing supporting cast!!
She was assisted by latoya, maryn and linda who was actually celebrating her 17 year anniversary with one nevada!
Again great service and i look forward to doing all my banking with onenevada @ nellis!
I've been w/ pcf for a long time.
I do recommend them, personally.
I do basic banking, i find them to be professional and efficient.
They certainly promote a no-fee banking system, and competitive interest rates.
I've had a mortgage w/ them, but would still recommend comparing rates before committing to them.
Pcf is versatile, they offer: savings accounts, chequing accounts, interest-free accounts, gic accounts, mortgages, gics and i'm sure more.
I just glanced at a few other yelpers comments.
I've no doubt that their experiences w/ pcf differ with mine.
:(  i guess to you, the reader, take each review w/ a grain of salt including mine.
Also, i do my banking mostly online and the site seems secure.
Centennial leasing & sales was the best buying experience that i could have asked for.
I went to carmax, private party (craigslist), and a local dealership.
At every other location you are hit up from the moment you walk onto the lot.
And left me alone.
On the other hand, i never felt as though i was abandoned.
2: quality of vehicles & transparency: every vehicle on this lot gets thoroughly checked and repaired from top to bottom.
Then hesitantly went to check to see if it was even available.
This is one area where centennial really outshines everyone else.
Additionally my car is in perfect shape, and runs exactly as promised.
4: what about haggling & price?
This is the one area where you have to know what you're getting yourself into with a lot like this.
Similar to carmax, there is no haggling.
You look at a car and if the price isn't right for you, you move on to a different car.
Personally, i loved this about centennial.
There are no games.
None of the standard car lot being unwilling to give you a price, and making you fight for hours.
No "let me talk to my manager," none of that.
It's a great car buying experience, not an adversarial battle.
But it does mean that you're not going to talk them down an extra $1,000.
5: vehicle selection: it is a smaller lot, probably under 100 vehicles when i was there.
There is no reason to waste your time fighting anywhere else.
Disclaimer: i wasn't paid for this review, nor did i receive any benefit.
This is an awesome pawn shop, a hidden gem.
I stopped by to browse some items and was pleasantly surprised to find a ton of great stuff for sale.
You can't get into the lot from anywhere else.
Once you get inside, the place is full of quality items.
I saw a nice congo drum set, golf clubs, jewelry, and native american jewelry.
The prices are very reasonable too.
I couldn't help it.
Return factor - 95%
With all of the helpful, detailed reviews here i will keep mine short and sweet.
I'm super happy with pcf.
I have both bank accounts and a credit card with them and have had zero complaints.
This was by far the best car buying experience we've ever had in all our years of buying cars.
We were made aware of centennial by a friend who also introduced us to az federal credit union.
Cameron walter was our contact and we were very happy to do business with him.
We had some specific requirements and after some quick research he was able to locate some options for us.
Within 3 days we had made our choice and picked up our new vehicle.
The whole process was easy to walk through, all questions were answered, no high pressure sales tactics were employed.
All in all, very professional service and this was a great experience.
We will be recommending cameron and centennial to all our friends.
Wf is our bank of choice!
Great customer service, excellent hour, 24 hour phone line for help!
We love wf and all that they offer from personal to business services!
The staff at the maryland parkway branch are always helpful and courteous!
The line moves fast even on a friday!
They are always fully staffed and ready to go!
Love these girls, jennifer is awesome!
Everyone is super friendly & helpful!
I have never had a problem with anything and i wouldn't bank anywhere else!
The personal banker axiel is the best!
He always knows how to handle my banking needs.
The tellers are extremely friendly, efficient and quick.
New name and they're still doing fine.
Maybe not perfect, but they're local, not a big institution.
Happy with oneaz and their services....again, they do very well for the average net-worth person.
Staff at the main office even took time to help increase our credit scores.
Nice and informative staff.
So happy to join one nevada cu.
Becca was awesome & made me feel like "ohana".
The she told me about getting money back for using my card...
We went to centennial at the recommendation of our credit union and we were super impressed!
This was one of the easiest car buying experiences we've ever had.
It was so nice to be able to look at the vehicles without being pressured to buy.
Got my car loan from this branch!
Everyone there is so helpful and they have my business for a long time.
Matt is the one that helped me and so far i've gotten 2 car loans thru him.
If you're trying to finance anything, go to matt.
I used to bank at pnc for my small business.
That was until they started charging me monthly service fees.
That is why i switched to first commonweath.
I stayed because i didn't want to change bank again.
I'm glad i stayed.
They worked out some of the bugs with the mobile app and i trust it.
The only problem is that they do not offer unsecured lines of credit with ease as pnc does.
So shop around before you pull the trigger on a loc or loan.
I called about an item, and they had it out and ready for me when i arrived.
I bought a great very lightly used motorcycle helmet for a fraction of the price new.
As soon as you walk into this beautiful bank branch you are immediately greeted with warm smiles and happy hello's.
There is rarely ever a line and the tellers are extremely friendly and courteous.
One of the friendliest tellers is paul.
They know you by name and are responsive.
I've had a relationship with them for a couple years now for my small business.
Paul from the mesa branch bends over backwards for you.
However, when i did advise them of the issue, they took care of it immediately.
My girlfriend bought a car here.
She was treated fairly, low pressure sales.
In an effort to protect sensitive information, this review will be concise.
I researched banks thoroughly before choosing this one, and i'm glad i did.
The staff is friendly, courteous and of the utmost help with all questions and concerns.
I wasn't being sold to.
I also enjoy that this bank is local, as i try to avoid nationwide banks when possible.
If you support local banking, want comfortable service an security, then first commonwealth is ideal!
I love writing reviews, but man this one is tough.....
Flash back to winter 2015 (i think).
I was looking for a vehicle for the husband.
I had in mind what we were looking for, a genesis.
The husband had used the az fed car buying service for his 04 grand am.
Said he wanted to use them again, so i agreed.
And in enters tod hale into our lives.
I gave tod the criteria we were looking at and he went to work.
I wasn't in any real hurry to buy another car since we had working family vehicles.
That all changed though a few months later.
April 2016 and a distracted driver = my suv totaled.
Once i had the property settlement completed, i called up tod and he went straight to work with new criteria.
End goal being a replacement suv, used, and ticked off all my accessory boxes.
You can say i was looking for a used unicorn.
He called us up and we head down to go look at a vehicle he found.
Neither the husband or i really liked it, but walking the showroom i spotted the optima.
A vehicle that didn't fit out criteria, but looked super nice!
Tod gave us the rundown on kia vehicles and we were sold.
24hrs later, we had our new family car (may 2016).
Most salespeople would have said, you're a p.i.t.a client..bye.
Lol  but the man has the patience of a saint.
In fact talked me out of a lot of vehicles.
His motto, if you're not in love with it...don't buy it.
He wants you to be completely happy with your purchase.
About a month ago, tod sends me info on a truck.
It was beautiful, except it wasnt the color i wanted.
Usually i just tell tod i'm not interested and we move on.
But for some reason, i kept an eye on this truck on the website.
That entire time, the truck didnt sell for one reason or another.
Maybe because it was waiting for it's forever home with me.
:d i finally pulled the trigger this week and got it.
And i'm in love with it!
Lol  first world problems.
Thank you for everything, tod!
This review will is based on the fabulous customer service i received from jc.
Jc helped me out of a tangled up mess my employers incompetent payroll company created.
Jc did everything he could and was successful on making sure everything was resolved.
4 stars for jc and his fabulous customer service!
Thank you one nevada-it's people like derek taylor that make you stand out from the rest!
I do business at this location regularly.
Most of the time, things go very smoothly.
I'm always greeted with a friendly staffer as i enter the building.
Deposit and withdrawal slips and extra pens are plentiful.
The cue for awaiting service with the available tellers is often very long.
This location is quick to answer with help if you come in seeking help with the software.
As for the other components of the branch, the drive through wait times tend to be short.
The walk-up atm devices are typically in good working order, and i have seldom seen them out of order.
Pros: larger than typical location, with a lot of people on staff.
Plenty of parking and short drive through times.
Cons: inside cue is usually long and slow moving.
Mr. hughes gave top box service.
I mistakenly discarded my spending debit card, with no hesitation he provided me with a brand new card.
I was in and out in less than 15 minutes!
I started banking here several years ago.
I switched banks after usbank wanted to charge me a monthly fee because i didn't want to do direct deposit.
This is a credit union so it doesn't have the many account requirements other banks do.
That means no monthly fee for me.
The employees have always been knowledgeable, courteous and friendly.
I also have never had errors or any problems with my accounts.
Every time i walk in this bank i feel like i visit my friends or joining a warm party.
The tellers here rock!
Fast, professional and very friendly!
Edel and n'gui are always very nice to their customers!
And, seriously, n'gui is a star of wells fargo, the best attitude!
:-)    keep up the great work, credit union 1!
Hands down the best pnc branch in all of pittsburgh!
Amazing employees, phenomenal management, superb customer service and easily accessible location!
You just cannot beat this branch !
I had the greatest experience financing our home purchase with ryan lopez.
Ryan exceeded our expectations and was patient, thorough and was always quick to respond any time of day.
I would happily refer anyone to ryan and his team.
He has worked with many of my clients post bankruptcy in helping them purchasing or refinancing their homes.
He is an expert in his field and is honest and up front!
The nice lady, amber, was so awesome.
She greeted me and helped me open a checking account.
I never had this experience at my previous bank.
I got checks printed, new card, and  her service was awesome.
I'm glad that i switched to mountain america.
I came to open an account with bank of america and even got my car refinance.
Nancy carrera-pedraza is amazing and helped me so much.
Make sure you come and see her :)
Eric and his team rock!
Eric carefully made sure i could get all the discounts possible for my home and car.
I was never presented with an up-sell and everyone knew what they were doing.
Two thumbs way up for this business.
The employees at this location go out of their way to give you the best service possible.
But once i started working in uptown charlotte and discovered this branch, i knew i'd be a member for life.
They're great to work with.
Roger white and his team made refinancing my house a piece of cake.
He does everything to make the process as easy and fast as possible.
If you want the lowest rate and great customer service, roger white at one nevada credit union is your guy.
I will definately be working with him in the future for all of my mortgage needs!
If you're on yelp, i figure you can navigate a computer though).
2) make 12 signature-based debit transactions a month.
This means don't use your pin, and run it as a credit card.
You can buy 12 packs of gum.
Or buy 10 cents worth of gas 12 times.
You can also use it to pay online utilities.
This is not a hard requirement to fulfill, really.
3) direct depost or ach bill pay.
The other thing that makes this deal a beauty is that the 6.01% rate is guaranteed until april 2009.
12 blissful months of earning twice as much interest as my stinky online savings accounts.
So after doing my research, i headed on over to the azb&t branch down the street from me.
From the moment i stepped through the door, i received very attentive service.
I've had a bit of experience signing up for bank accounts, and the process was similar to most.
Also, my initial deposit slip was handwritten -- which seemed a bit shady.
I haven't gotten this kind of personalized service since leaving my teeny tiny hometown in hickville, az.
I sent my friend over to sign up, and he's had no issues so far.
Ask for nicci or nicole and tell them heather s. sent you!
Signed up for their emsplus reader 2 months ago.
Saving me soooo much money since there are no monthly fees and the rate is lower than square.
About to take them up on the rebate offer for the chip card and apple pay reader.
Only $49 after the rebate that requires running some amount of credit card sales.
So far so good with these guys.
Hard working group of associates.
They work with what little they have and still manage to keep a smile on their faces.
People can be rude and they don't let that get to them.
So i gave state farm another chance but with a different agent and i am so happy!
Denise and pam are amazing!
For sure go see them ;)
This is the only east valley branch with extended hours - especially on weekends.
Other branches close at 1pm, but this branch closes at 5pm.
I've predicted every financial collapse since the 1980s.
Believe or don't - your money - your choice.
They treat my elderly dad very well.
He wisely left chase and said he's never been more satisfied with any bank.
I love this branch and the crew that works there.
Ricky is a positive and very ethical guy, and you will never see him without a smile on his face!
He will give you honesty, candor and no frills assistance.
Joanna morris one million thanks for beeing so professional and courteous and helpful.
Thank you again for everything!
It was my first time applying for an auto loan and was not familiar with the process.
Thankfully, paola was able to assist me with what i needed.
After the fact, paola even followed up with a phone call with additional information regarding my application.
Thanks for going above and beyond for your customers!
I love one nevada credit union.
Suzie drinkwine is the best!!!!!!!
Thank you very much for all of you assistance every time i'm in need.
Knowledgeable staff and great customer service.
The agent and staff takes time to learn what is important to me and my family.
Would recommend this office.
I stopped in with a question about my checking & saving on the atm debit card.
I was instantly greeted with 2 or 3 friendly smiling voices.
I ended up speaking with angela for several minutes (it was not just at all at this particular time).
And what a lovely girl!
Answered all my banking questions & welcomed me call or stop in at any time.
Just opened my checking account with lisa and mac.
They were so nice and professional.
This credit union offers so much without the big fees.
I will use them for everything !
Thank you lisa and mac for helping me out!
Everyone should go here.
I have been a member for several years and have been very haapy with the tellers & office staff.
I've been banking here since i moved to phoenix.
Which was back in 1991.
I have a savings and checking account from the beginning.
Over the years they have been very helpful to me.
I had one of the best customer service experience ever!
She was very professional, very knowledgeable, very nice.
Mrs. drinkwine gave me alot of great  information.
I am glad to have met her.
She also recognize that it was my birthday and wish me a happy birthday.
Thank you suzie drinkwine.
This is banking old school style.
Everybody who works there knows my name, greets me by name, and gives me very personal service whenever i'm there.
I don't know many businesses that make house calls anymore!
And this was after he unilaterally proposed a new product to me that he thought i could benefit from.
I've also been pleased how u.s. bank has kept up with technology.
The girls inside the branch located here are super helpful.
They can always help answer any questions i have concerning my accounts
All banks are rotten, learn the system folks.
Never trust a four letter acronym "fdic," that starts with f and ends with dic.
After talking to the manager, it looks as though they will waive $300 in fees, wow!!!
Thank you thank you!!!
Customer service is huge and that's a five star for me folks!
Our experience at centennial leasing & sales was absolutely stellar.
I wish it were closer!
:)  we went to centennial because we have arizona federal credit union, and we wanted to buy through them.
They recommended centennial, and we couldn't be happier with the recommendation.
From the minute we walked in, there was no pressure to buy anything.
Eric, our salesguy, wasn't like the traditional car salesman.
No pressure, no coercion, no lies, no bait and switch.
The car driving experience was surreal: after taking your driver's license info, centennial lets you drive the car... yourself!
Yes, you and your friend (if you've brought them along) get to go test drive the car.
No pushy salesperson sitting next to you, telling you what to pay attention to and what to ignore.
Have i mentioned how refreshing this all was?
Before visiting centennial, we did go to the traditional car sales lot.
Their hours are flexible, so don't worry if you think you can't make their closing time.
They don't rush you out the door and there are no high pressure sales tactics.
I would absolutely purchase from centennial leasing and sales in the future.
They're the only place i'll go to buy a car, and the only place in phoenix/tempe/mesa/etc.
I recommend to purchase your next car!
She answered my question promptly and accurately so i knew what i was doing upon entering the branch.
I was then greeted by the tellers dave and cristina at the desk with smiles and a hello.
She responded very professionally and made sure i retained the information i was given which i really appreciated.
All in all, it was a wonderful experience that is worth sharing.
Their whole team put in effort to provide exceptional customer service, and i recommend them in the highest regard.
Lydia reyes was very professional and helpful!!!
I came in for checks and the process was fast, easy, and smooth.
Usually very friendly customer service.
They're adding the ability to create debit cards for lost or stolen cards in mid/october 2015.
Good to know if you've lost as many cards as i have.
Cameron walter is the best thing that ever happened to this kind of transaction.
There's no haggling here.
Give cameron your parameters and needs/wish list, and bam!
The guy is magical.
And i barely lifted a finger till it was time to sign the papers.
Cameron worked so tirelessly on this and never lost his professional and helpful demeanor.
People like that always give more to the process.
Centennial and cameron walter - thank you for making my life so, so much better.
After submitting necessary documents, i got approved in less than 10 mins!
Great job to mr. robles..
Thank you anthony manuel for a fast friendly service!
I appreciate your thoroughness.
I frequent this bank often since it's right down the street from my business.
I see this all the time in vegas and it sucks.
I'd drop by this bank if you're in the neighborhood.
Bank of a has eaten me alive with fees.
But im still there since i have direct deposit and ive never had a bank error with this bank.
I really hope my pleasant experiences continue with them when i get the chance to buy a house.
I have a very new car loan through them, then retired very suddenly.
It has been a very rocky road with the annuities coming through in a timely manner-hoping that's temporary.
I love doing business with them!
This was a pretty cut and dried experience for me.
I had even arranged my own financing in advance.
Anyway, that's neither here nor there.
Loved it and bought it.
It was quick and painless...under two hours total.
If i have any complaint at all, it would be with the keyless entry factory set security code.
I believe a dealership should make sure they have that information available or arrange to get it for the customer.
The ford dealership wanted to charge $80...eighty dollars...to get this code for me since i didn't purchase from them.
Well guess what people (and all you escape people listen up.
You disconnect the fabric covering to reveal the smart junction box.
The code is located on a black & white sticker above the electrical connector farthest to the right.
Overall just an easy and stress-free experience.
I was told by w.f.
I cannot speak to any bankers regarding loans and that i first need to apply online.
Even if i just had questions......really????
So, after doing a little research on yelp i came across cccu.
And boy did i hit a jackpot!
As soon as i walked in someone asked how i could be helped and connected me with the right person.
I initially spoke with dawn because i was interested in getting a home equity line of credit.
I've never done this before and i had a ton of questions.
She was very patient and answered all of my questions.
Once she helped me figure out what was my best option i then spoke to the branch manager tina.
She too was very patient answering all of my questions and walked me through the entire process.
There's no way you'll get this kind of service and attention at the "big box' banks.
You'll be glad you did!
A very friendly bank, the customer service is 100% always.
The employees go above and beyond to make you feel welcome and help you .
He is phenomenal in knowledge.
His expertise is amazing .
Charlie is my favorite teller he is my go to person at the bank .
He is great at it even though he looks young he holds a tremendous amount of knowledge
I would like to thank the amazing teller today at this location.
Quel lieu historique magnifique !temoin du début de la colonie .travail d'artiste pour la décoration de cette banque !
Quel luxe et qu'elle beauté!
I was provided with outstanding service, amy battin was direct, thorough, honest, compassionate, friendly and most of all knowledgeable.
By the way joe soltys with assist lock smith llc.
Was great as well, he was responsive quick and very friendly.
Thank you amy you are an amazing woman!!
It's clean and everyone is happy to help you!
I ended up finding centennial through azfcu, and eric helped me find an amazing toyota yaris.
Worked with roger white on our 15 year refinance.
Everything closed on time and communication was clear.
He also answers phone calls!
He helped us make buying our car a fun and no stress experience!
This is our second time purchasing our car through them and we had forgotten how easy it was.
He gave us a great deal on our trade in too.
He even went all the way to scottsdale to pick it up our new car for us.
He even called us to make sure we liked our purchase.
I have never had that before!
We will definitely be back to see jack.
He really went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of.
I have three automobile loans, a visa credit card, and overdraft protection with this credit union.
Katie bogner is a super star!
I was thinking in my head i would have to drive to 17th avenue or to first after i left.
And then it dawned on me, wait a minute cc had a td canada trust.
So off i scampered to the location which just happened to be around the corner from banana republic.
Noel was a great help!
There was no scummy car salesman act that was put on.
No lies, no smoke and mirrors.
But that isn't even really the fault of the company!
That is unheard of.
Thank you noel and centennial!
I love my honda cr-v!
Terrific job and customer service.
If you live in one of their approved zip codes you shouldn't miss doing business with this place.
We bought our tuscon when the rates weren't the best.
We went into to refinance it.
The process was easy.
We had an approval within 30 minutes and the loan was closed and completed the same afternoon.
The paper work was ready when we got there.
We have been buying and financing cars for 40 years.
This was by far the easiest and best service we ever received from a financial institution.
If you are planning a car purchase or refinance don't miss the opportunity to business with them.
As a retired financial professional i highly recommend this group.
Our loan officer was erica cameron.
She was so efficient she even caught a small recording error made by the dealer.
Don't miss doing business with this group!
I bought a 2015 toyota corolla from john zombrowski, and i couldn't be happier with my purchase.
I am very thankful to have been able to find and work with eric james and his staff.
I have referred his services to coworkers and friends without any hesitation!
Doing a refi or getting a mortgage is never a fun process.
Paperwork, uncertainty and scrutiny of my personal finances are hardly my favorite things.
Nevertheless, roger and sherry made the process as painless as possible!
Communication was very good, and i feel like i got quite a decent rate.
Will definitely use them again for my lending needs!
This branch process my transaction very quickly without waiting for an available teller.
Jamie quickly processed my deposit and searched if a personal check.
Then suggested methods to improve speed of transaction.
Then asked if i served in the military that would waive future checking account surcharge.
Unfortunately, jamie not allowed to previous surcharge.
This should been corrected due to previous va mortgage.
I opened my checking acct today.
I was very impressed with service  i received.
Suzie drinkwine was so efficient, friendly and knowledgeable.
A true expert in financial matters.
She  completely and clearly  walked  me through all the features and perks of my checking acct.
I would truly recommend this bank.
The best banking  experience ever !
I got everything set up over the phone- no hassle, no worries.
Been a wf for many years.
All staff is friendly and attentive.
Always offered coffee or water.
Never have any issue with my checking or savings accts.
Overall a great experience.
I came in here this past weekend to pay off my car.
Helped me out and made the process less intimidating and much more simple than i expected.
She even congratulated me on being an adult!
That was a great moment.
I was in and out of there in 15 minutes.
Thanks for the wonderful service!
I recently visited centennial leasing & sales after researching them here on yelp.
They have an indoor showroom that features many used cars most under 80k miles.
Their vehicles are in very good shape and their warranty work is serviced by cna.
Jack stoner  provided knowledge and assistance in a painless, no nonsense, upfront manner that i appreciated.
Since i have less than stellar credit, he helped me find a lender and a payment i could live with.
Excellent customer service---all the time!
Lori adds a personal touch to every one of her clients!
She's always thorough and keeps your best interests  in mind!
She's been my agent for years and always takes care of us!
Neguy, one of the many tellers at wells fargo bank, delivers a wonderful satisfying friendly service every time.
Always sets a smile on my face during my every visit.
I really wish every human being on planet earth could have the same positive energy as neguy.
I hope i am not misspelling the name :/
Just moved here from ky and we knew we wanted a credit union for our banking.
Stopped by at this location and was very impressed by mckenzie(forgive me if i misspelled your name).
Says a lot for your training staff too.
We got our debit cards on the spot.
Love that they have so many locations.
I adore this bank!
Small, personal & great customer service.
The drive thru is always quick.
I was then able to simply sign and drive away with my new car!
Very good experience, i highly recommend seeing cameron!
I used arizona federal credit union for my auto loan and they have an expert buyer service.
I was assigned john zambroski from centennial.
No hassle just a great experience.
Thank you arizona federal and john zambroski.
I love this bank with a passion!!!!!!!
The folks here are so friendly and professional!!!!
My banking is always done perfectly and they treat me like a queen every time i go in!!!!!
Nice clean bank with friendly tellers.
Seems kind of price gougey.
I'm used to paying $3 atm fees at the club or at events, but not at a bank.
They should really re-evaluate that.
I recently switched banks because i have been unhappy with wells fargo.
This location is right across the road from my job so i decided this would be my best choice.
He was super friendly and sat me down and started to explain all my best options with banking with them.
Working in the customer service industry myself i definitely recommend this place and the bank has been nice so far.
Bank staff is mindful and attentive.
They usually give me a warm greeting and they work quickly and efficiently.
I've not had any problems so far dealing with him and they have become my go to bank.
The bank hours could be improved upon and their look could be updated.
I have purchased three cars through jack stoner at centennial and will never buy from anyone else.
Jack makes the process so easy and comfortable.
Wow one word amazing love our experience from the minute we walked in and out.
Eric was very knowledgeable and he kept educating us without pushing.
I really felt comfortable and i highly recommend this place.
All our questions were answered and even he went out of his way to give us great advice!
Good luck and thank you centinental!!
We will be back:)
Okay this is my first experience with a credit union, and my first experience with one az credit union.
It was a wonderful and amazing experience with ann osmond, on the greenway & 64th location.
We opened up multiple accounts for me and broke everything down.
Give them a try!
As far as rates go, i couldn't honestly tell the difference.
He financed an investment property for us and went well above and beyond to not only meet, but exceed expectations!
Sergio was great, communicated well throughout the process and took care of business!
His pricing was amazing and his rates are extremely competitive!
Will definitely be doing business with him for another investment property in the near future!
I wish i knew the guys name that took time out yesterday to help me on a matter.
He really deserves recognition.
I've read a lot of negative reviews about this branch but i don't understand why.
I really feel these guys go over and beyond.
And yesterday proved it.
Keep up the great work guys.
Keep in mind on these reviews.
Most people (by the thousands) don't comment or leave a positive feedback when credit is due.
It's only those that feel they had a bad experience that leaves negative feed back.
It's a shame because i guarantee the positive reviews out weigh the negative by the tens of thousands.
We shopped around for lenders and one nevada had the lowest rates of them all.
He always called or emailed back when i had questions/concerns.
Timely response and good service.
Only 4 stars because i don't want them to get too cocky.
I heard about the azfed car buying program from my father.
I checked out the site, found a beautiful and gently used toyota corolla and e-mailed a representative, eric wilson.
Literally two minutes later he called me on a saturday.
He was extremely friendly, polite and informative.
Eric exceeded my expectations.
He was very through and detailed but respected my time as well.
I am extremely indecisive but he helped me figure out what car would best suit my needs.
I settled on my first choice and the paperwork was easy and he walked me through it.
He was amazing and was perfectly accommodating and kind.
He's also very personable and easy to talk to.
I appreciated his professionalism and compassion.
I will continue to refer this company and i adore my car.
It rides like a dream!
Very friendly and professional!
Very nice customer service too!
Very fast efficient and very helpful.
I really like doing business there and i am particular.
This branch is so nice, and the decor is interesting.
Rather than a long counter that tellers stand behind, they have three wood "pedestal" tables.
I don't know how they handle high volume.
The staff are very friendly.
Always courteous, always efficient, and they call me by my nickname instead of legal name!
Forget chase, and come to uwcu.
Margaret is the best!
So pleased with my experience, can't wait to come back!
Taking a peek at the reviews  and i can honestly disagree with many.
As a customer here for many years  my experience is the service is always friendly and professional.
Been here quite a few times and i've had nothing but excellent service.
Bankers are always pleasant, ask how your day is going and try to help you with everything you need.
It is a little hidden though, it is just a little door in between einstein's and the mr.
I've been banking with macu for almost 3 years now.
Originally opened my account in utah.
I have absolutely no complaints with them so far.
Customer service is always so nice and so helpful.
Recently had some fraud hit my account when someone tried to make an online purchase with my debit card.
Macu customer service was on top of it right away and literally had it removed and handled within 24 hours.
I've been banking with this branch for approximately a year and half now and absolutely love this branch.
Just like their customer service everyone at this branch is extremely nice and extremely helpful.
Especially loan adviser desiree.
She helped me get a helping hand loan (bad credit loan) which cs originally had advised me to look into.
I know there's not one other bank that would approve this kind of loan.
I would recommend macu to anyone and everyone.
5 star rating all around period.
My only complaint if i absolutely to say one would be lack of locations in las vegas.
However i would continue to use this location even if they opened more locations all because of desiree.
5 star service all around highly recommended!!
My first time opening a checking and savings account was with this bank.
The service here is beyond outstanding.
I was greeted by mac, a financial service representative.
I, as a young adult, came to one nevada credit union seeking financial advising and credit building options.
Mac introduced me to the credit builder loan and it's credit building process.
The details were brief but extremely easy to understand.
Mac was extremely helpful and i highly recommend his financial services!
They are extremely busy(something that the staff cant control) so sometimes the wait for a banker can be 30 min.
Now  that's just stupid!
I waited around 10 minutes last time i was there(which is not bad).
People need to have more patience in general.
I really appreciate having a local branch i can trust and know that i can go in and be helped
Earlier this year (2016), my wife and i decided to buy a second house.
It turned out to be a very fortuitous referral for us, and we simply have to tell everyone about it.
The succinct description is that our recent mortgage banking experience was legendary!
This dramatic description is really not much of an exaggeration.
It never hurts to talk!
I love tod hale!
This is our third car we have purchased through centennial leasing for my son.
Tod is knowledgeable and goes above and beyond!
It takes car buying to a whole new level.
No waiting at a dealership all day long.
Smoothest process ever and i highly recommend him to all of my friends.
Thank you gary errecalde for the fantastic customer service!
You guys are the best!
Andrea solis is the one u can talk to, with no problem at all!
She's a super nice lady.
Fast service inside the branch.
For now, there's only 1 drive-thru lane where you can do payments.
The other lane is either out of service and/or being fix.
I waited for about 10 minutes recently at the drive-thru lane.
Looking for a cu shared branch location?
This is one i recommend.
If you go inside you will find friendly and helpful staff.
Some locations seem to look down on shared branch members, but not here.
You can get service with a smile, and without any attitude.
There's hardly any lines either at least when i've been there.
Their atm also accepts shared branch deposits....which can be hard to find.
I have been banking with them for 4 years now.
Always professional and helpful.
Maybe it has been a coincidence,  but it has happened at least 8-10 times during these years.
I now use the drive through more often.
Though i've only been to this bank once, i had a very pleasant experience.
I just bought another gently used vehicle from centennial auto sales.
I purchased my last one from them quite a few years ago.
It lasted me until my daughter totaled it...
This one is a lot nicer, but then again it is a newer vehicle.
The quality of vehicles and level of service and customer care is the same or better than it was before.
You can't really improve upon very close to perfection.
I would strongly recommend that anyone looking for a fairly priced high quality used vehicle contact john zambroski at centennial.
Really can't beat that.
This bank has the best hours.
Decent weekday closing hours.
Customer service for the most part is awesome.
I've only come across 1 person that had mediocre service.. everyone else every other time has had exceptional customer service.
Very easy going bank.
Little to no fees.
I was in town for vacation, and needed some cash.
After reading yelpers reviews, i decided to visit this branch to experience the great service myself.
Boy, i have to say, this branch is indeed awesome!
), and then offered me an envelope without me even asking.
It was as if he could read my mind on how i'd like my transaction be done.
Gotta love this branch, keep it up guys!
Love this bofa,  small town friendly, and the tellers are very friendly and equally efficient.
The line did move along swiftly, as michelle dealt very courteously with each of her clients.
I worked with keith williams on my first new car purchase.
Most of our transactions took place with emails and texts.
Keith had all the contracts and paperwork filled out prior to my arrival.
We had previously discussed financing options, and he took the time to get the best rate.
I was out the door in a brand new honda just pennies over invoice.
This is how buying a car should work.
I applaud the centennial team for being honest, zero sales pressure, very helpful and professional.
Keith also offered to get me the dealer cost on any upgrades or enhancements.
I am beyond happy to have opened an account with one nevada !
They are so knowledgeable and helpful !
Also a very kind .
The craig location is my favorite .
Kathy is a sweetheart.
She always welcomes people walking in and takes her time in dealing with any issues customers may have.
I only have a student checking account here so i guess my review should be limited.
The us bank iphone app has been a life saver!
Well, maybe not literally but it has been that good.
I've always been treated with respect and genuine care.
Any who, as nacho libre would say..."ees fahntastick"
Just refinanced my car and saved tons of $$$!
Rebecca took such good care of us!
Love the craig branch!
The only thing i wish would change is the amount of location/branches there are.
Hopefully in the near future we can see other branches opening up?
Nice, brand new bank
What an amazing staff!!!!
I am never disappointed when i have a need!
The ladies at this branch are particularly attentive to my needs and always go above and beyond!
Kathy is always very helpful every time i step in to the branch.
Kathy is the employee that all employers wish they had.
Decided it was time to leave bofa.
Just opened an account here with a personal banker who has amazing follow through.
She actually called a few days later to make sure everything was as it should be.
The staff at this location are professional, helpful and humble.
If you need an account, do not hesitate to speak to vanessa, jody, tito or ken.
I highly recommend this place to anyone that does not have an account.
Thank you for service!
They always answer their phones quickly and have great customer service.
Anytime i have a question, they be sure to explain it to me so i know exactly what is covered.
They also communicate with me through email which is fantastic since i do not answer my phone often.
Ana and kelli in the office are very sweet.
Plus, they gave me the best rate for car insurance!
Thank you guys for everything!
Only been here few times and always a happy customer.
I came in a few weeks ago to cash a check but didn't have an account with them.
They signed me up for a free account that didn't take long at all.
The best thing about this place is the workers.
They were slammed busy, with people coming in from the rain.
It was closer to closing time & honestly i felt like i had walk into a party.
The worker were all in a great mood.
They were joking around with customers and because the atmosphere was so awesome i felt chipper as well.
Best time i've ever had walking into a bank.
I have been banking here for about 6 years now and everyone has always been helpful and friendly.
The signup at the front could use some tinkering.
I have seen some confusion about who's next in the wait queue etc.
As far as customer service, i haven't had any problems.
Linda is awesome and is who i opened my account through if i remember right.
Wonderful customer service !
Thanks to margaret mims -a great banker.
She is caring and professional and an asset to the organization .
Always willing to be there for me.
Her manager , mary is delightful too.
Thanks ladies ,  nicole
You can get money any time you want!
(assuming you have some to withdraw.)
Lori ploetner & her staff is the most compassionate agency in town.
They care & it shows.
It's a complicated world & it's nice to work with someone that wants to simplify your life.
I can recommend this agency for your auto, home, life, and retirement needs.
It's a nice one stop shop.
Justin f. did my saving a month ago and helped me out with open my first credit card.
Great guy and super helpful!!!
Always fun to talk too!
I bought my 2014 ford mustang today and the experience was great.
This was my first car buying experience and cameron walked me through the process step by step.
Overall a great first experience, if you're looking to buy a car give these guys a shot.
The ladis at this branch are the best i love coming here their smile and attentiveness is very good.
It's bank of america...
I like this one over the bell and grand  ave. location.
I'm not sure what the first reviewer was talking about.
This location is great for:  - men's and women's shoes - friendly staff (the former manager, robin, was excellent.)
- kids' toys  bathroom report: decent
After being highly recommended from friends, we chose to work with roger white.
If you're looking for good rates,professional staff and quality service go see roger at one nevada credit union.
They've always been friendly and easy to work with.
A very friendly bank, the customer service is 100% always.
The employees go above and beyond to make you feel welcome and help you
Everyone needs to go and see mo.
He is very helpful.
Arizona federal credit union is the best bank in arizona.
Nice work az federal, i am impressed.
Great experience with cameron i highly recommend buying a car with centennial leasing.
They are respectful and straight forward.
I am so thankful for staff who take customer service to another level!
I love this branch, thank you so much for all your hard work and professionalism john!
What i like about this place?
What i don't like about this place?
The money isn't mine.
Seriously,  there isn't usually a wait for a teller and they are very friendly.
Also,  they usually will let you use their restroom,  if you ask.
It's behind the door that says employees only.
The people here are competent, thorough, helpful, and friendly.
They've helped tremendously with financial advising, and have dealt with problems very quickly.
This is a great branch, and on top of that, it's rare that i ever have to wait in line.
I went this wells fargo to update my married name on my bank card and complete a couple other things.
This is a typical wells fargo, as far as setting and appearance.
I just happened to be welcomed by one of their staff members alex.
After i told him why i was there, he told me he had just gotten engaged a week prior.
We had a really nice chat about getting engaged, married, how we met our significant others, etc.
He was a very personable banker.
This bank isn't the closest to my house but i would go back here for my banking needs.
Everyone at the bank seemed to know what they were doing and seemed just as helpful as alex.
He's fast, friendly, positive, prsuper efficient!!!
Your professionalism is much appreciated!!
I had to do very big amount wire transferred.
And i am not local i am from california.
Still they did it in no time.
Very professional and smooth!
We are banking with us bank since 2014.
We get great service here every single time !
This particular branch has awesome staff & the manager !
Mary bishop is the best.
She always has a beautiful smile and she takes care of business quick and painless.
But dont forget about the people that work there and the cleanliness of the branch.
The employees bring a comfortable happy emotion to the room.
They all greeted me upon arrival and they all look so pretty with happy faces.
They represent one nevada with outstanding performance.
One of the banks im with.
They have an atm, and tellers.
Mrs. margaret mims did a fabulous job as always.
She very helpful with all of my banking needs.
She is very well appreciated!
Another great experience at this credit union.
If you need a auto loan, new account etc.
He is by far the best employee there
Just got done processing my third auto loan through one nevada and these guys are amazing.
They actually just refinanced a new car loan from a dealership at a much lower rate.
The application and approval process was simple and margaret mims who helped us was fantastic.
I highly recommend one nevada for anyone seeking some kind of loan in the las vegas valley
Recently just financed a brand new suv.
We decided to add gap insurance.
We inquired thru the delearship and our own insurance company but the price is too much.
We are talking about anywhere from $2500 to $3000 which they add on to the loan amount.
We were  helped by lisa b.
Lisa was very professional, friendly and courteous.
She took time to explain what gap insurance is and its benefits.
We weren't rushed or pressured to get one.
And she followed up with us every step of the way until we finalized the paper works.
All in all great experience and would definitely recommend this branch to everyone.
Thanks credit union and lisa for the awesome deal and great experience!!!
I was so lucky to be helped by blanca ramirez!!!
I would like to say that margaret mims is such a      credit to this nevada credit union!
She is very knowledgeable and makes the process so easy.
It was a pleasure to have her helping me.
I would definitely recommend ,one nevada credit union, because of this wonderful employee.
Margaret mims  puts the credit in this union!
Thank you margaret mims for working for one nevada credit union.
What a wonderful experience to buy a car from centennial leasing and sales!
Buying cars is usually torture with frustrating negotiations and wasted hours.
I always feel like i'm being held prisoner until i buy something.
I know that in the past, i have given in from pure exhaustion.
Our experience at centennial was the complete opposite.
It was actually fun.
We picked centennial after reading the positive reviews on yelp and thank goodness we did.
We walked around for a few minutes and then were greeted by jack stoner.
He had a list of all of the cars in his hand which listed the cars, their mileage and prices.
He said he was there to help and to just browse.
When we found a car to test drive he would pull it out and send us on our way.
We actually held him back to ask advice on which cars would fit our needs.
He was knowledgeable and friendly with no sales pitch.
We finally picked out some cars to test drive.
He pulled the cars one at a time out of the lot.
He spent a few minutes explaining any driving quirks, and then let us drive away.
Thanks to jack stoner.
I completely recommend centennial and will go there for any future car purchases.
It's the way car shopping should be!
We have been members for a very long time.
The plus side of this is the protection we have experienced relating to their debit and credit card service.
We haven't banked in a regular bank in years so i can't speak for the banks around phoenix.
We really have to thank their oneaz department that oversees the activity on your debit and credit card usage.
If it wasn't for them our account would be no account.
That is not true.
Even though i check our account at least five times a week.
Thank you for protecting us from the so called villains out there.
Linda at one nevada credit union was outstanding!
She updated me on all events and let me know all documentation required.
I would highly recommend linda here at the blue diamond location.
Gary at centennial leasing and sales was very helpful, professional and definitely made my first buying experience easy!
Curt and his office staff are great!
I have moved all over the country and have felt with many service companies.
This state farm agency really cares about me and my needs.
They are friendly, remember me and my family and are there anytime i need them.
This is probably the nicest wells fargo ever!
Every time i walk in here, the manager always welcomes me.
Not a lot of wells fargo makes you feel this special haha.
The bankers are also very nice and ask how you're doing and everything.
Great overall, customer service!
So much elbert for going out of your way to help us.
He was very helpful in a stressful situation.
We were stranded at bofa with car issues and elbert was nice enough to help us.
Oh yes laurie with remax!
Every one that works there are always willing to help and surprisingly remember everyone that banks there!
Vanessa is always a pleasure to talk to, she is funny and has the best personality.
On the mortgage side worked with rebecca and ryan.
I had another lender competing with them, and they blew them out of the water.
I would recommend anyone to refinance through one nevada!
I have worked with joe for over 15 years, he is a true professional.
You put in a card and four digits and get out cash to pay for great times with friends.
How can i rate it anything else?
Richard zhao was pretty awesome!!!
He was our banker and super cool!!
Helped us with our finances and gave us a good tip!!
He needs a raise!!
Great location and awesome that there's an atm drive though service.
Property is clean and employees have always been nice when i visit.
If your not refer to them by family there is a 50.
Charge to join but it's well worth it.
They have tellers with personality who also care about you and keeping your business.
This location is also open on saturdays which is super convenient.
I have finished cars through them and you can't bet the rates and easy process.
I have come into the centennial leasing offices several times over be past couple years.
Tod hale is a class act!
He always greets me with a smile even though i haven't made a single transaction.
I have looked at cars, ordered cars, left messages and played phone tag with him time and time again.
Today was different...i finally bought a brand new (to me) car!
I couldn't have asked for a better experience with tod and his sales team.
Thanks you tod and kelley hale for running an amazing dealership and keeping this customer beyond happy!
I love my new gmc terrain!!
Treat you like a person as opposed to wells fargo where you are just another sales opportunity.
This is my wells fargo home.
The accountants and bankers are very polite and understanding.
Countless times they have worked with me on financial situations and always have surpassed my expectations.
Special shout out to anthony wesson for providing exceptional customer service.
I've been banking here for a long time.
They have awesome customer service.
I have only had great experiences with one nevada.
I also like that you get cash back rewards for shopping at places.
I should have written this review last month, but i've been busy enjoying my new house!!!!
I just recently purchased my first home in las vegas.
After shopping around with several local and online mortgage companies, i chose to use one nevada for my mortgage.
My loan officer was ryan lopez.
He has many years experience and never had any hesitation in answering my questions or helping me.
Ryan also secured me a rate that was lower than the other local mortgage companies that i shopped with.
He also answered my calls anytime, even at 7-8pm!!!!!
My loan processor was stephanie cooper.
She also has many years of experience and it showed as she processed my loan.
The seller had required a short close date and stephanie really hustled and met the deadline.
Just like ryan, stephanie always answered my calls when i called.
Ryan and stephanie are a great team and did a great job communicating.
Not only with each other, but also with me!!!!!!!
They made my home purchase a fast and easy experience.
In addition, i also saved a lot of money in closing costs compared to the other lenders i shopped with.
As a long time banking customer of one nevada, my recent mortgage experience just solidifies my relationship with one nevada.
Great experience and highly recommended!!!!!!!
I saw blanca last friday to open a new account.
She made things so quick and easy and made sure i got what i needed for my small business.
The location is super convenient and the staff are kind.
Blanca ramirez was so sweet and helpful, give her a call!
Thank for everything and i hope an increase in pay is in her future!
Great customer service and great insurance!
I have been with nevada federal credit union for years.
Probably since i moved to nevada 20 years ago.
They were the credit union on nellis air force base.
They have always been a great banking facility.
I bought cars through them and i've had my account with them for a very long time.
I've tried other banks but love nevada federal because of their service when you walk into their branches.
It's nice to sit down at a desk and talk to your banker.
They always help you solve your financial problems or at least they try to.
Great selection and customer service.
Zach rehberger helped me and was very knowledgeable.
I have been banking at this location for years and have always been treated with the utmost respect .
All the bank personal are very friendly and professional.
Will, the branch manager always goes out of his way to help me with my business account and personal.
He has an amazing staff!
If you need an honest professional banker i would highly recommend this branch and will.
Thank you for the great service!
This place always makes me happy.
Way better than any bofa or wells fargo ever made me feel.
They actually get to know you and i have only been with them for 8 mos.
I think i can safely say that i will never put my money in a bigger type bank ever again!
If your still banking at chase or wamu i highly suggest a switch you'll never be happier.
This bank is amazing.
Always friendly always helpful.
So why only 4 starts.
That's because they don't really have a walk-up atm.
But that's a good thing i guess.
But other then that this bank is amazing.
Not for profit financial services.
I had no idea i could join.
I thought only u of i employees and professors could join.
But locals, i guess residents of champaign county can join.
Alumni, former employees of u of i, family, uic and uis can join too.
I really like that they are not for profit.
So all their income goes to the credit union.
And they say they can't be bought or sold.
So no worries that some big bank will take over my credit union.
I get the sense they are part of the credit union not jus warm bodies.
Great people on the personal banker side.
Represent the bank well.
This location was always quiet every time i went, so you can avoid waiting.
One teller whose name is sherry knows what she is doing.
You will get the best service.
Thank you sherry for improving a quality of teller's job.
After fed up with my bank nsb, i gave a try cccu for just to get my second home loan.
Dawn young, is very knowledgeable person at this location and she exactly told me what loan fit to us.
I highly recommend this location and every one of them very friendly and helpful.
I moved to boston a few months ago from scottsdale.
I love working with him, it's great to know that customer service still exists.
If anyone needs a bank/banker/ financial assistance, check this particular location and ask for james.
I've used various pc financial services (debit card, credit card, tfsa, rrsp) for about 10 years, and i'm very satisfied.
We've used cccu for years.
We've always felt like valued members and we've always received great customer service.
We've never had any issues or disappointments.
Excellent customer service yesterday!
Helped with professionalism from beginning to the end of my transaction the way i have for over 25 years.
I was helped by mac and he was able to help me with my problem.
He gave me his card as well just in case i wanted to do an update on the progress.
A week after filing i was still able to get in touch with mac for an update.
He was able to provide me with all he information i needed.
Thank you so much for the help!
This is the finest insurance office & agent i have ever seen.
Lori is simply incredible, knowledgeable, kind & considerate .
Her staff is also amazing.
They will guide you along thru any problem while making it seem simple.
No matter what happens it stress free.
Make no mistake in this critical area by choosing this lori & staff.
Proud to be a member!
I had questions and concerns.
The staff could not have been more accommodating and informative  very happy with the service and respect i received.
I've been a one nevada member since 2010.
Shelly webb has always gladly helped me with all of my banking needs.
I will never bank with another banking institution.
When i first started working with shelly for my banking needs, it was at the centennial hills location.
When she moved to the craig road location, i followed her to that location.
I can't say enough about aaron reed.
Aaron has followed through 2 months past closing.
I never thought i would own a home again.
He walked me thru each step and made it happen.
No matter how stressed and skeptical i was, he was there to explain the process.
He is a shining star with stearn's lending.
I don't know what experience some individuals have had with stearn's lending, but it certainly was not with aaron.
He is the real deal and absolutely earned every one of the 5 stars.
You will be in good hands placing your mortgage with him.
This bank is the friendliest in vegas!!!
Everyone calls me by name when i walk in the door and they always have smiling faces!!!
Very clean and professional!!
Quick and friendly this location is top notch!
Our experience w/ eric was excellent.
He was thorough, knowledgeable and made it easy for me to come to a decision.
A truly professional experience throughout.
Bravo eric-  cheryl g.
I tell you that rebecca a and her staff are the best in town.
They'll get you your answers when you need it either by phone, email and in person.
All my banking need is here.
No better place to get your best rates for your loans.
I trust to this staff.
Thank you rebecca a and staff.
Stopped at this location when i was in the area working.
The tellers are always pleasant.
I almost bought a used car at a traditional dealership.
They told me how they have the mechanic look over the car and they only sell cars in perfect condition.
I had my mechanic look it over and he found over $1200 in repairs needed.
The next day i went to see bob bloom at centennial.
He showed me the carfax and the off site inspection and repair bill.
Centennial isn't a traditional dealership.
All the cars are inside and they set a fair price.
No need to negotiate.
We bought my son's first car from bob and it was a great experience.
I recommend you call centennial and ask for bob, you won't regret it.
Tell them, pat sent you :)
I recommend coming here for all your banking needs!
I went and discussed when i needed with my business loan.
I'm not sure whether i'll get the loan or not but that will be revealed in stories to come.
I love going to this bank.
Very attentive and helps me the best he can.
Atm is always fast and i'm in and out of there in minutes.
No ridiculously long lines (:
Great experience at this location.
Staff was extremely polite and friendly.
They took their time explaining their programs and options available.
Even better was the short wait time!
It was my first car buying experience, so i was nervous to say the least.
I was hooked up with cameron through arizona federal after i was approved for financing through them.
Cameron made the experience easy and comfortable.
In the time leading up to my purchase i was out of town on vacation and cameron knew that.
Cameron stayed calm, cool, and friendly the entire time.
He never gave off the "pushy salesperson" vibe that i was so afraid i would encounter.
I didn't have to talk to any dealerships or search myself.
I gave my specifications and he found exactly what i asked for.
I highly recommend centennial, and cameron, if you are looking for a great car buying experience!
I went in to close and account and worked with connie chavez who is absolutely wonderful.
Upgraded my account as it should have been in the first place and i had been missing out on.
Cameron walter met with me and immediately i felt welcomed and at ease.
This was the best experience i've had with the purchase of a car.
Cameron was informative and incredibly friendly, taking the time to understand our needs and limitations.
He's just a great guy, and centennial and all of their staff were welcoming and accommodating.
I highly recommend doing business here.
I'll recommend cameron and centennial to my family, friends, yelpers, and anyone else looking for a vehicle.
I'd give more than five stars if i could.
Ok so this was my first time using this branch.
As soon as you walk in the mood of the office isn't like the serene location.
I was even greeted when i walked in which is always nice.
I was helped by sweet kathy, who was soooo helpful and went above and beyond my expectations.
I definitely will be back to this location.
So thank you kathy for giving me such amazing customer experience, it truly is appreciated!
I experienced excellent customer service today at western states bank.
Ivy and the other employees were extremely helpful and informative when assisting me with a concern i had.
I appreciate them and would recommend this branch to anyone in the future.
Virginia fargo is one patient amazing person!
She was extremely helpful and aggressive at helping us get a loan for our new home.
Bob bloom hooked me up with my new car, and he worked really fast.
The purchase itself took 15 minutes, and then we were done.
Bob was real friendly and real honest, and the whole transaction went smoothly and efficiently.
Let's face it buying/finding or even test driving motor vehicles can be stressful.
Especially, then ones that won't leave your side until you buy.
Tod hale who's a sales consultant at centennial leasing and sales, is a professional when it comes to clients.
He made this process easy and fun.
Clients are the boss, you tell tod specific details do(s) and don't(s) he will make happen.
My aunts old car died sooner than she wanted.
A coworker/friend told her about tod.
She didn't let us down.
My aunt test drove 4 vehicles in her price range.
She loves her 2018 toyota rav4.
Thanks tod, i will be coming to you when i need a new car in the future.
Let me start by saying i love chase all around.
They are the best bank i've been with and every branch is friendlier than the last.
And she got me taken care of like chase always does.
Thanks so much guys!
Keep up the good work!
Hardly ever a line.
The banking staff are very pleasant and always helpful.
They're really helpful and really friendly.
I'm a guy, but this place smells horrendous it's like a mixture of old, paint and pesticide smell.
It's tough to bear and it hits your nostrils immediately upon entering.
I'm not one to complain, but i know i can't be the only one to experience this.
I'll give 'em  a 4 of 5 though.
Curt garrett's office is so helpful.
The staff treated me and my husband like we were family.
They explained all of my coverage's and saved us a lot of money.
Their office was referred to us by our friends who have been their customer's for over 20 years.
Our friends praised the office so much we decided to see them.
What a great decision.
The best thing about this bank is that they make you feel like more than just another person.
They never have to ask for a manager on anything.
They are empowered and i trust they are looking out for my best interest.
They can explain all the details and make the process as easy as possible.
I have purchased by last 2 cars with centennial and they are wonderful to work with.
I will never step a foot in a conventional car dealer ever again!!!
Deer valley credit union has been my bank for more than 20 years.
She assisted me to great satisfaction and shared information with me to prevent future mishaps with my account.
I appreciate all of her assistance.
Service like this makes me want to continue on as a customer.
Thank you alberta :-)!
I love this bank.
Great costumer service each time i walk in.
Every other bank lacks what this bank has.
I will always use this bank.
Whether you need a to open or move a personal or business account this is the bank for you.
Ask for sara carlos she is the best, she takes the time to ensure you understand all your options.
Awesome, awesome customer service!
I am very happy that i made the decision to work with ryan lopez and the team at one nevada.
I did not expect that financing my first home would be this painless.
Closing costs were low and completely transparent.
I've been a member for over a year and every experience i've had has been positive.
Their online banking and billpay is extremely user-friendly.
I have several "club" accounts where i can designate money for specific purposes.
The best part is i am earning better interest here than anywhere else - including ing!
All the while, top management there was making annual salaries that i'll never see in a lifetime.
I strongly recommend azstcu.
We had an amazing and seamless experience with this business.
They work with our credit union to find exactly what we want and at the absolute best price.
Tod hale was so personable and took the time to understand what we wanted.
After a test drive and a discussion - he set about to find the right truck for us!
Thank you for your one on one attention and the delivery of the vehicle literally to our doorstep.
We highly recommend this place for your automotive buying!
Oh, and ask for tod!
Linda w. is wonderful.
She provides the highest level of customer service, professionalism, very easy to talk to and friendly.
Linda w. is an exemplary asset to one nevada cu!
I've done some banking here a few times.
My last visit was pleasant enough that it should be noted here.
I came in to get a money order (i was told they could do them here).
She was very kind and had a friendly demeanor.
She told me it was directly behind the building--walking distance!
I liked that she was so nice.
I cannot for the life of me remember her name, though.
I know that she's a short blond lady, and i'm pretty sure she wore glasses.
Linda, arlene, michelle & pretty much all the reps have always been friendly & helpful.
Coming from a small town, it's nice to have that small town atmosphere in a city like this.
Great place to get my banking done.
Love love love uwcu!!!
We have moved out of wi yet we remain with uwcu!
Recently my husband & i were married & stopped at this location to open a joint savings & checking!
It was so smooth & the women who helped us was great!
I have been here in about 3 time in need of assistance of a banker.
Every time has always been a pleasant experience.
My need always taken care of.
I have been very happy with their service at this location.
This is staff is on their a game and is always very helpful when i need to do any transaction!
This branch is all about quick service and making sure you have been helped!
I have been banking with one nevada for over 8 years now.
I have never had an issue until this year when i had fraudulent charges on my account.
Since this had never happened before i felt violated and confused at what to do.
After explaining my frustrations they were there to help, and they did.
I love the friendly professionalism in this office.
I came here looking for a better price.
I got it plus they explained what all my coverages were.
And what that meant to me if i should have a problem.
I'd been paying for insurance and really never knew for sure what i was buying.
I felt at home in curt's office and i felt welcome.
Their service has turned out to be superior any time i need them.
Well, it's a bank :) what would i do to enhance the experience?
Purchased a car from cameron and honestly the easiest process i have ever gone through!
Great service and selection!
She is the perfect balance of insurance knowledge & customer service.
She has gone above & beyond with wise counsel & specific insurance guidance with automobile challenges of family members.
She was the first to educate us about an umbrella insurance policy as our assets have grown.
Pam's insurance "hat" is teacher & we have been grateful students!
Thank you, pam, at clark mantz sate farm insurance!
Have been here many times.
Always friendly staff and hardly any lines or waits... greet location as well.
The best place hands down for home loans.
I got a lower rate than anywhere else i shopped around at.
They were super patient and very helpful.
Great experience all around!
Every time i go into this branch, i get waited on right-a-way.
If the tellers are busy with other customers, the branch mgr.
José offers to assist as well.
They are always friendly and it makes me want to return again and again.
This branch is very friendly and professional.
"manager wil p." does a super job of leading his amazing staffs!
I am very well taken care of every time i come!
Keep up the awesomeness chase team!
The tellers are pretty helpful and friendly.
But what really makes this branch great is their bankers.
Each is smart and friendly.
I always get so much help from jonathan- he's my personal banker.
Can't give 5 stars because the management is awful.
Makes you wonder how everyone else got to be so helpful.
I've bank with chase bank for 5+ years already and i really enjoy using all chase atm's.
There are 2 drive-thru atm's and 1 atm inside the branch.
I like that idea which it will keep non-chase customers away from the bank.
Have used this branch for years.
They always seem to be quick, courteous, and efficient.
Sometimes they even offer a cold bottle of water for the road!
Even during signing with the escrow officer, he remarked that we "sure got a good deal."
We wish you the very best of everything, dawn!
You definitely deserve it!
I'd change banks if this was the experience i could expect from my bank.
This bank is really from a bygone era with beautifully decorated ceilings, velvet curtains, chandeliers, beautifully designed.
Everything was decorated and finished with attention to detail only possible in something of this age.
The elevator doors were a feast of images, each individual.
Surrounded in marble, i cannot imagine ever getting bored or too familiar with these elevators.
All of the interior reflected the opulence of the elevators really from the war memorials through to the entrance.
Worth a special visit as anyone can enter and take a look around during normal bank hours.
Justin fliek helped me on my business account.
Great service and courteous employees.
Rachael was very professional!
Very friendly and helped me out.
Thank you rachael for your patience!
I've lived in las vegas for 3 years and just recently moved back to california.
This was the nearest wells fargo to me and my banker was javier lopez.
He assisted me in many ways with my banking needs and questions.
I've never had any experience as the other individual making a review about him.
He's always treated me with respect.
I suppose some people get sensitive when they don't get exactly what they want like children.
Earlier this year (2016), my wife and i decided to buy a second house.
It turned out to be a very fortuitous referral for us, and we simply have to tell everyone about it.
The succinct description is that our recent mortgage banking experience was legendary!
This dramatic description is really not much of an exaggeration.
It never hurts to talk!
My fiancé and i mad an appointment in regards to finances.
We were lucky to have had rene rico as as our advisor.
She was beyond knowledgeable, answered all of our questions and went above and beyond for myself and my fiancé.
People like her are the reason i'm so glad to have bank of america as my bank!
She is a gem.
Cameron was amazing from start to finish!
), and did it all with humor, good stories and a smile.
No nonsense and no fuss (well, on his part anyway).
Best car buying experience ever - by far!
Thanks for the new ride!
I am reviewing this bank as part of the history of montreal.
Do yourself a favor and walk in.
Appreciate the architecture and extravagance.
This place is what a hobo dreams a bank would be like.
I also used the atm.
It's a good atm.
We have had several car loans from this credit union and couldn't be happier.
Thank you for your great service.
I have been buying cars from bill levitt for about 10 years.
It doesn't matter where he goes, i'll buy the vehicle from him.
He always has my best interests at heart and doesn't pressure me into a decision i'll regret.
I always know that i'll get the best price from bill.
The great thing about centennial is that you can have any car you want!
If you're looking for a used honda pilot, he'll get it for you.
If you want a new toyota 4runner, he can get that for you!
I emailed bill, told him what i was looking for and the car was at centennial within 24 hours.
Buying the car was a breeze.
He found the best possible interest rate for me and the paperwork took 10 minutes tops.
No sitting in a finance office being high pressured into a bunch of add ons.
This will change the way that you purchase cars ... for the better!
No trapsing around car lots with the vultures descending down on you trying to high pressure you into a purchase.
All the vehicles are parked in a spotless indoor climate controlled warehouse - this is a great car buying concept.
I highly recommend bill levitt and centennial for all your vehicle needs.
Really is difficult to become excited about "banks" whether it is a real bank, credit union or insurance company.
With that said cccu (or three c u) is just an exciting place to do business with.
Great service, wonderful people and terrific rates!
Try their auto buying service, it is excellent as is their used car warranty plan.
What is not to like???
Overall its a pretty good store.
Fairly clean and organized.
Great branch, i financed my rv and truck through these guys.
Everyone is so helpful and will go above and beyond for you!
I use the drive up services once a week.
The teller at the window is always friendly & efficient.
I never wait long.
She processes my transactions in a short amount of time.
She offers excellent customer service.
Drive up teller is awesome when i have the gson.
2 drive up tellers drive up atm.
Makin it easy to get at our $$
I have been to this chase location multiple times in the past few months due to purchasing a home.
While i am not doing my mortgage through chase, i do bank here and needed bank statements and documents notarized.
Every time i've gone, the employees were quick to greet me and ask what i needed.
If they couldn't help me, they would direct me to the correct person.
Every time the employees were friendly and courteous.
I was able to get in and out relatively quickly and always with exactly what i needed.
This was a great experience.
My wait has never been long and i like that.
The employees know what they are doing and are able to help customers efficiently.
I have purchased 4 cars through centennial over the past 10 years.
Every deal has been fair, honest, and includes great pricing for new cars and trade ins.
The shop around for competitive financing.
They work very fast so strap on your seat belt the minute you call!
Well, not if you bank at credit union west!
I had read about this, but thought there must be a catch.
There is no catch!
And, you really don't have to take any action.
I tried texting 4info and didn't get anything helpful.
I gave up and decided to stop at one of the tons of big name banks i kept passing.
I resigned myself to a $3 fee.
The other day, i was balancing my checkbook and i noticed they had already credited me the $3.
I didn't even call to ask how to get atm fees credited.
They saw i had been charged a fee and credited it.
Of course, i'd prefer to use a cu west atm when possible, because, as i mentioned, i'm a member.
That means i'm an owner.
Banking with a credit union just gets easier and easier!
Never ever going to another dealership again!
Why would i, when centennial sales and leasing has cameron walter.
I didn't feel like i was being taken advantage of because i was female, nor did i ever feel pressured.
Cameron is like santa, you send him your wish list and he gets busy finding your new set of wheels.
I feel he obtain the exact vehicle for my needs and price range.
Cameron really made this a less stressful process.
I just bought a dodge durango from joe at centennial.
This was the best experience i have ever had buying a vehicle.
He took care of everything!
He brought the car to my work so i could test drive it.
He handled all the paperwork and financing.
I signed papers and picked up the car, no hassle.
I walked in and got helped immediately!
I was given great advice as well as assistance on how to build my credit.
Highly recommend this location!
Jeremiah at this branch made it very easy to open a cd with them.
Kudos to jeremiah and truwest
I love wells fargo.
The people at this location always take good care of you.
I currently lost my debit card and gina was super helpful in setting me up with a new card.
There is an actual bank at this location
This branch is amazing!!!!!
The tellers are awesome and friendly.
They remember me and some even call me by name.
I also had the best loan experience.
From my primary loan to my heloc.
Dawn young is amazing and makes you feel important.
They make my family feel like family.
You have my business forever!!!
I have been a member for a little over 4 years now.
Was with another bank before that absolutely would not work with me at all.
I have a business and am growing every single day.
I needed a bank that would work with me and grow with me.
When i went them i had one little truck.
Now i have a fleet and have finally been able to grow my business.
I go to the asu branch the most and am consistently impressed with all of the staff.
I have sent numerous friends and customers to them and they have all been happy as well.
I walk in and they know my name and really do make it personal.
I am beyond happy i made the switch to them and have not had one single problem.
Thank you for the great customer service and going above and beyond.
One nevada (craig) you have an amazing manager.
Thank you rebecca for making it easy for me, i felt relief after the meeting and explaining.
I am staying with your bank.
Suzie is an awesome lady, too.
Kudos to you both!!
I love this bank if only there were more valley locations.
This location has a security guard, atm with depositing capabilities.
I don't know if they have a night drop i just use the atm.
The branch is small but has lots of people in it to help you.
Its right next to some good food and a safeway so one stop shop and eat location!
This branch has very nice people and they are helpful.
Liked wells fargo for a long time.
No hidden extra charges you get with other banks.
After making the rookie mistake of going to traditional dealerships, we were recommended to come here by my fiance's father.
Boy, do i wish we had known of this place before starting the arduous journey of car shopping.
Todd is super friendly, accommodating, no haggle, polite, tells personal stories, etc.
We bought a car the same day and are picking it up tomorrow morning!
I am so pleased with shopping here and will purchase my next car here too.
Jeff a  can i ask you to please.
Remove the last name of this banker.
If the bank is the issue take it up with bank of america.
If its with the person write a review to him.
How would you feel if your name was on a public site.
Say what you want but leave the employees out of your issues
All the staff at this location are great!!
But, suzie d is amazing.
She's been a huge help with understanding many financial situations, and has great advise!
Staff is very friendly and efficient here.
They can help with you with many types of products here.
Atms are also very friendly to navigate and also work with apple and android pay.
It's my first time opening an account at one nevada credit union.
She is the definition of an awesome banker!
She helped me open up an account with my personal loan.
She gave a very personable experience and i like to know that there are bankers like her around.
Now, time to switch my direct deposit.
I have experienced many greedy and uncaring insurance agents here in las vegas.
In short, they decreased my costs, and increased my coverage substantially, period.
Thanks guys, mark simpson.
Tod hale at csl just sold me a car and i couldn't be happier with the whole process.
He is kind, funny, makes it easy to do the whole financing process, etc.
As you can see, i am updating a review from 2012 now in 2018.
I went back to tod for my new toyota 4runner.
I did not even bother going to a traditional car dealership this time.
Let tod handle them if he needs to.
He will find what you are looking for even if they do not have it in inventory at the moment.
Highly recommend and definitely ask for dean!!
I've had state farm for many many years now.
I moved to vegas and chose this agency because of the friendly staff.
I have moved all my policy's here from multiple cars to renters insurance.
They were even able to get me a great rate on a car loan.
I don't hesitate to refer any of my friends and family here looking to insure their homes or vehicles.
Drive thru atm works all the time without fail.
I wouldn't usually review a bank but this location did impress.
The only thing that stops me from giving 5 stars is that they are closed on weekends.
The service is very nice and personalized and the staff are eager to suggest solutions to your financial concerns.
And you can usually get a competitive rate if you need to refinance.
Best of all, by banking with azstcu you are keeping your money in this state and supporting local enterprise.
So glad i broke up with b of a and chase.
A lot of branches have a coin counting machines on premises that you can use free of charge.
This location is right by my house so i go there often.
The employees are great.
There's 2 guys that once they get used to seeing you are amazing.
I mean really they crack me up!
There's tons of housewares here.
If you are a diy person like me you will always find tons of stuff to fix up back there.
I have found paint-able furniture there for cheap too.
I have scored a bunch of jewelry boxes here in good shape for cheap!
Lot's of other goodwills don't have that!
They have lots of toys and the kids clothes are generally in great shape.
Women's clothes are good.
You do find treasures!
I have got brand new original tag still attached shirts!
Men's clothing.. there are tons of dress shirts and pants.
Most are in excellent shape!
The best part though is the other people shopping.
You see the strangest people in here!
I love the women with carts full of horrible vests, stretchy pants, and god awful ugly dresses with fringe!
If you don't find treasure in here at least stick around and watch people.
Suzie d helped me open my first bank account.
She was very helpful and explained everything well and she has gotten me on track to build up my credit.
I am so happy doing my banking at one nevada credit union!
I was pleasantly surprised!
I arrived and was immediately greeted by margaret mims.
She was friendly and easy to talk to about my need for a separate account.
It only took her a few minutes to set everything up so i could start saving for our family vacation.
I was finished in just a few minutes and on my way.
Thank you margaret and one nevada for taking good care of my banking needs!!
First, the app works great!
I've maybe had it crash on me once.
You can see all your accounts, transfer funds within, and your balance increase and decrease exactly with each transaction.
Second, all the people in multiple cities that work for this bank have impressed me.
Tucson's tellers were so positive and welcoming to me as a college student.
Scottsdale's crew were so helpful and informative when i got married and my husband and i started making plans.
The phone line workers who reset passwords, help with online questions make you feel like you are very important.
Thank you so much, oneaz.
Joe and his staff are fantastic; i get fantastic service every time i visit this branch.
He's is very professional and he truly cares about his clients and people in general!
I would always take my business to sergio.
Thank you sergio it really was a pleasure working with you and we will definitely cross paths again!
Danielle and kyle are always so helpful and kind when i come in.
Even when it's stuff i don't understand they make sure to explain it so i can understand.
I left a 17 year relationship with bank of america for compass in oct. 2012.
I'm very happy with the customer service i receive every time i stop by.
I highly recommend them as being a yes bank instead of a no bank.
We were in the market looking for cars.
I talked with cameron, hope i spelled his name correctly, we had a great conversation and even better meeting.
I would highly recommend this company to my friends and family.
We weren't high pressured or hassled.
It was one of the most pleasant times i have ever had buying a car.
Big thumbs up to cameron and the guys at centennial leasing and sales.
I received excellent customer service from maria moran!
She was very thorough in explaining all the details of the different services they have to offer.
She took the time to ensure i chose the right checking account, by explaining in detail how each one works.
We used them for our orginal loan and our refinance.
Ricky knows what he is talking about he is knowledgeable and anwsers questions.
He did a couple things that made me upset i told him and he fixed them and made everything right.
He has an awesome team working for him.
They are patient and always anwser your questions.
If they are unsure of an anwser to your question they will find out the anwser and call you back.
They where quick with getting our loan done also.
Will use then agian!
I telephoned bank of the west today about a pending financial transaction.
Great marks all the way around for miss elvie - bank of the west is lucky to have her!
Everytime i've been to a uw credit union, i am always so pleasantly surprised at how nice everything is.
Great people providing great service!
Stopped into this branch recently to pick up a cashiers check.
In addition to the lack of a line, the service was friendly, fast and provided with a smile.
The facility was clean and the drive up atm looked to be getting renovations.
I will definitely visit this location again.
Oh yes laurie with joshua smith group!
Don't go anywhere else but centennial!
Of course he's used to 1930s-1960s technology so that could explain it.
You should see him with old tube-type radios!]
You don't have to be arizona federal credit union customers to shop here but it sure couldn't hurt.
And did i mention how honest and non-hassling they are?
Do yourself a favor, never ever go anywhere else but centennial.
If they don't have it they can get it!
And ask for eric and tell him deb sent you...
Opened an account here today and received excellent customer service from peggy.
Overall, a great experience and i would definitely recommend this location.
I recommend them highly!
And if you are in there regularly enough, they remember who you are and are always willing to help!
I've been banking with this bank since i was 14 when i got one of my first jobs and loblaws.
I can say that i've never had a problem with this bank.
I personally would recommend this bank, but please read the rest of my review.
I recently experience a mild case of identity theft.
Not too bad - the companies involved stopped the charges or refunded the money that had already been taken.
But i did cancel my debit card and visit my nearby branch.
I entered with two out of state checking accounts, a recent large deposit, and a barely used checking account.
I was helped this afternoon by the senior personal banker, monica l. she was incredible.
Very personable, patient, and helpful.
She explained everything, made recommendations, and helped me put my accounts in the best position to work for me.
I came away with an arizona checking account and a money market account.
The two out of state accounts will be transitioned out once the fraud charges have been restored.
I have been a boa customer for 8 years, but rarely use their services other than online.
Kyndra was extremely helpful.
I would recommend one nevada credit union to anyone.
I scoured the internet to find the bank or credit union that was offering the lowest rate.
If you've recently purchased a car, then you'll know how terrible rates are right now.
Since that was the lowest rate i could find, i decided to submit an application.
I drove up to the location off the i-17, and submitted an application with jennifer.
She was very friendly and made the process very easy.
Unfortunately, because i arrived so near to closing, a decision wouldn't be available until the next business day.
Not a problem, i happen to have two parents with phenomenal credit, and a robust history to back it up.
My dad called jennifer and submitted his information with my application.
Unfortunately, that same day, my dad suffered a detached retina, and was scheduled for an immediate surgery.
This clearly left him unable to visit the branch with me, anytime soon to sign paperwork.
Shortly after, my mom called jennifer to replace my dad on the application as my cosigner.
I was so impressed by her prompt service and attention to detail.
I have both my auto loans through one nevada.
Thank you suzie for everything.
We recommend one nevada to all!
Great credit union to work with.
We love tod so much that fate must have not wanted us to part ways so soon.
He again comes through for the husband, in almost record time.
All while meeting the husband's type and my $$ criteria for a replacement.
Now here's hoping we can keep these vehicles for a while.
3 vehicle purchases from tod in 2 years is my limit.
Lol   thanks again tod and kelly!
Psa - just say no to impatient and distracted driving!
I needed to make a deposit and this was the nearest place for me to go.
I'm not the biggest fan of pnc banks, but this one was pretty decent.
I appreciate the newer atms that you do not have to have an envelope.
It makes it so much easier and is less waste for the environment.
A couple of beeps and boops and i was done.
Made it so much easier for me than having to fill out a basically useless envelope.
I always have an excellent, friendly experience at this branch.
Everyone is always very knowledgeable and helpful with my banking needs.
Today rebecca was not only friendly, she was very efficient with my visit.
In and out of her office within 5mins.
I love banking here and will continue to do so because of the staff and the amazing app.
This one isn't so busy and was able to fix some problems going on.
Short and simple, but most importantly quick and not a huge pain.
Gonna come to the branch instead of talk to people on the phone.
It ended up much easier and was able to fix the issue.
What an amazing experience coming here today!
First off it's 118 degrees yes i'm not lying 118!!
That's what you call amazing service.
The tellers were quick, efficient and friendly!
I'll definitely be back.
Thank you wells fargo
Lemme tell ya something!!
The staff ( corie, danielle, maria, sarina and becca) at the craig branch is flat out getting in done!
Ya know, they will tell ya the whole truth and nothing but the truth!!
If it can be done!!
They get it done!!
Well, they try really hard to get it done within the limits of their business practice and ethics.
Thanks ladies for doing what you do in the manner you do it!
Sincerely, glory travel las vegas, nv
Absolutely love this credit union.
Today i was helped by joanna she was very helpful and friendly and took care of everything quickly.
If you are considering switching to a credit union this is the best!
Btw this is my first yelp review.
Go see for yourself!
I've been using this branch for several years now.
It's nice to visit because i always feel very welcome here.
Everyone is very helpful and it's nice to have in a bank because not all banks are like that.
The credit union west branch on dunlap was about as helpful as i've seen in a cu.
They seem to focus on making customer's lives as easy as possible.
Best credit union/bank.. join you won't regret it.
I will be a lifetime member!
Centennial is the way used car buying should be.
Centennial has a no hassle business model - offers fair pricing, amazing customer service and a true no pressure experience.
Truly excellent people to deal with and the next time i need a car it'll be my first stop.
Arrived using the drive through, was in and out in 3 minutes and 19 seconds!
Used it just as quickly purchasing acai bowls and 40oz malt liquor for the entire fam.
Will definitely return as needed.
Basically i make all my ebay deposits and transfers here.
I really love the convenience of the location.
The afcu fam here is very friendly and cooperative.
I have yet to have any problems with any of my accounts with them and dig their low rates.
They are located inside of the smiths here, making it a very easy shop and deposit spot for me.
Everyone is so helpful & kind always willing to take the time to listen to my questions and concerns.
I love this branch.
Kathy is very helpful, she always does a great job with helping me with all my needs.
I would highly recommend this branch.
Try and not go on a saturday because the place is packed!
Also it is an extremely small parking lot and may be difficult to find a spot.
The best in town.
Highly recommend sergio becerra to anyone that's looking to buy a house and need a loan officer.
Kept me informed at all times and made my process very smooth and easy.
Keep up the amazing work guys.
First time with the credit union and so far its been all good!
Been banking at another bank for years and i wish i would of switched a long time ago.
Credit union west was recommended to me for a home equity loan.
Did all of the approval stuff via email and phone but had to go to a branch to do signatures.
I was so impressed that the branch closest to me (dunlap) stayed open until 6 pm on a friday!
How convenient for people that work until 4 and can't easily leave during their shift.
I had an appointment but ended up getting there 20 minutes early.
They saw me right away anyway and i didn't have to wait even a minute.
Very satisfied with the whole experience!
The staff at this location are professional, helpful and humble.
If you need an account, do not hesitate to speak to vanessa, jody, tito or ken.
I highly recommend this place to anyone that does not have an account thanks with a different bank.
Thank you for service!
I would give this place a 10/10 for customer service.
Especially melissa who remembered my name after only coming to this location only before.
She took the time to answer all of my questions and make sure i was well informed.
I would definitely come back to this location again for that 5 star service!
Best rate and lowest fees i found for vegas.
Everything was quick easy and smooth from start to finish.
I went in to make changes to my account.
She was even able to quickly get me a crisp $50 bill to send to my nephew for his birthday.
It reminds me why i bank here!
My review is in regards to home loans.
That is not my experience with chase, especially this location.
I have worked with loan representative, matthew fitzpatrick, for a couple of years.
There are no other "big banks" i would refer other than chase, and most specifically matthew.
He found exactly what i was looking for, and got me a great price on my truck.
I highly recommend !!!!!
I have had credit union west since 1994.
I use them for checking, savings, and auto loans.
Tod hale is one of the best!
He made this car buying experience the best i've ever had.
His attention to detail, and his willingness to help you get the car you actually want is, unrivaled.
I would recommend him times out of times!!
He asks what you want, and don't want, then goes to work to make your dreams come true.
Kerrye has been a tremendous help!
She is so sweet and kind and extremely helpful.
She really cares about our needs and does what she can to make it happen!
I am a busy individual and i urgently required information to aid me in making a more informed decision.
She had a caring approach and is a true professional.
Cindy burgoz is what i call the epitome of quality customer service.
Please accept my gratitude towards her and your firm for the efficient service provided.
Eric james was so wonderful to me and my mom.
My father passed away after a long battle with cancer.
He had an insurance policy with state farm.
My mom was literally cut off financially until all the paperwork and processing was done.
We didn't know that it would take a couple of months for her to receive any funds.
Mr. james was so professional but sincerely compassionate to us.
His staff was very caring and attentive.
He did all of our paperwork in a day and we received my dad's insurance payment the following monday.
I highly recommend eric james for any and all of your insurance needs.
He was truly a godsend when we needed him most!
The teller brooke is so sweet.
She definitely goes out of her way to make sure the customer is happy.
Thanks for making my day.
Cccu- n. decatur branch deserves 5 stars.
I got my home loan here (was recommended by my friend).
Dawn, the home loan specialist has made my experience flawless, a positive one.
But most of all dawn in cccu offers the best rate/ low apr.
I would not hesitate to approach her again for a car loan in the future..
I have been banking here for over 20 years and have been happy with the service and convenience.
Been with this branch for 8 years and have never thought about switching.
The customer service is excellent and tito, the manager, is always outgoing and helpful.
This is my favorite one nevada location!
Suzie was excellent helping me apply for my first loan and credit card!
The staff here is knowledgeable and kind!
Friendly and efficient, what not to like?
Parking was good, i would give it a 5 star if exiting the parking lot was not confusing, hahaha
I enjoy having my debit card and credit card with them!
They are helpful over the phone and provide great benefits.
I made the best financial decision by banking here!!!
Corie the bank manager is amazing and very informative.
I cannot say enough great things about this organization and the people who work there.
Her excellent customer service is top notch and all the other girls are wonderful too.
I highly recommend this credit union to everyone!
Came here to refinance my vehicle and destiny was very helpful.
I have posted a review on google, and i felt like this group of people needed more praise.
Sergio was great to work with!
As a realtor, it is crucial to have good communication with your loan officer.
Sergio was always available and responded very quickly to calls, texts, and emails.
He truly cares about his clients and takes great care in providing them with the best service possible.
I can say enough good things about this branch.
I recently got hit with fraud on my account, and was notified as soon as it happened.
I went in and talked to linda.
Thank you very much
It is good bank.
This area not too much people .
I always could coming no appointment, good way .
Despite my opinions i must say that i find this specific branch to be the one to go.
My experience with setting up new accounts, buying money orders or just having a question answered have all been positive.
Greeted by two friendly and pleasant employees... great experience
I have "banked" at crdit unions for over 40 years.
They are not as "greedy" as banks.
We use azscu in payson and the staff is excellent.
Great personalized service, they know us and never send us away displeased.
I would give them 5 stars except for the dollar limit on web bill pay.
I have been a member with cccu since i was a child.
We walked into the brand new decatur branch and met with dawn young.
We were never confused about anything that was before us.
Although along the way, i think it was the processor, chianti?
I immediately contacted dawn and she apologized and handled everything for us.
We skipped emailing back the processor and just dealt with dawn as it was much easier that way.
I just wanted to point out an amazing employee who truly cares about her members!
For any loan needs .....please go see dawn at the decatur branch.....you will be treated like royalty!!
My husband i are thoroughly please and would recommend cccu  & dawn for any home loan needs!
I was referred to centennial leasing and sales from my credit union and the rest is history.
I explained to my sales guy, cameron, my needs and the type of car i desired.
He made many great recommendations.
When i finally made a decision on the car type, trim and color, cameron made it happen!
He found the exact car and had it delivered.
The purchasing process was easy, stress free and fast.
I want to thank cameron for a great car buying experience!
Super friendly service today by the banker who helped us open a savings account!
As soon as we walked in, the manager came on out and asked us what we were there for.
He told us to have a seat and that the banker would be right out.
The whole process didn't take long and the banker was beyond friendly.
She was patient and answered all our questions!!!
Went in to this office, cause it was the closest office to precott az.
Walked in and was waited on right away.
My needs were met.
No problems and felt good when i walked out.
Long time ( 28 yrs.)
Recent first visit to this branch was very pleasant.
No waiting, very friendly management.
They have really stepped up there customer service experience.
Just made a major transaction with/for our parents who are in need of assistance in their advanced years.
Tara was an amazing help.
This bank made my parents feel like people and not numbers or money.
Thank you for caring for our parents.
We have been working with this agency for many many years.
I also find state farm's rates to be the best with the best coverage.
I was at chase bank yesterday.
I can't verbalize how nice it is to find such a caring staff.
They went out of their way to help me and i really appreciate it.
Thank you so much !
Large branch for all you personal and business banking needs.
Drive thru in the back.
I have been with macu for almost 10 years now.
I value their work and that is why i bank with them.
Ps  please open another branch on the south side of town.
I've recently moved to las vegas from indiana.
Eric and his staff made the transition smooth for me.
His team has been very helpful.
They are friendly and attentive.
Not just this branch, but the corporation in general is super helpful.
Alerted of fraud, but i was unable to go to the beach because i'm out of town in college.
Even gave me the addresses of the nearest sister branches i could go to to retrieve money from my account.
As a local realtor i send all of my clients to kristine.
There is no better place in the valley!
Cashier's check easily obtained with no account but a credit card with them.
Nice, friendly, easy, and welcomed me to az :).
Jose, naira, and kiyanna are always so welcoming.
I only frequent the bank once a monthly maybe and for them to remember was pretty surprising and appreciated.
I was referred to centennial leasing, by a relative that purchased two cars from cameron.
I have never had such a smooth vehicle purchase.
I would definitely recommend centennial and cameron, if you're in search of a vehicle.
I was referred to one nevada by a friend and wanted to say the service i received was incredible.
Thank you for taking the time to help me understand what one nevada has to offer.
You turned my day into a better one.
Great friendly service from rebecca.
We appreciate how the process was so quick in closing and for answering our abundance of questions.
We will certainly recommend you at one nevada credit union.
Come here and deposit or withdraw money.
This is the very best financial institute you ever going to be.
Derrick martial is the man can get your auto loan with no hassle.
And the best rate in the market.
I recently bought my tesla and i went through with cccu, specially this branch.
I didn't have any difficulty to get my loan with 1.9 apr.
I am getting ready to move my all the business to this location.
I have been with one nevada for 5 years.
Linda is the best, she is always happy to help you.
I will not bank anywhere else
Brahim and wonu are the best people.
The bank itself sucks as they charge high fees, but the staff is great.
We have been members of one nevada for many years, and our usual branch is by our home.
She made everything seamless and took care of everything for him.
She gave him a new card and peace of mind.
He is going back to see if he can get a better rate on his auto loan.
Thank you for the continued excellent service after all these years!
Just got my first house!!!
I am so grateful for ryan and stephanie.
They made the process of buying a home so doable and with the least amount of stress.
One nevada employs knowledgeable loan officers that will make sure you get what you deserve with your money.
Uwcu has been the best banking experience i've ever had.
I usually go to the branch at union south.
Thankfully, i am a young person with excellent credit.
When i opened a credit card, they told me my limit could be as high as $10,000.
When i took out a car loan, a similar thing happened.
Due to my high credit (which increased over four years thanks to their credit-building tips!
), i was approved for a very large loan at the lowest rate available.
Truly, they have been the best experience i've ever had!
I bought a car through joe cistone at centennial leasing.
He took the hassle of my car buying experience by providing excellent customer service.
I will definitely call joe cistone again for my next car buying experience, and i highly recommend him.
Your money is 100% available, no lock in cd etc.
You receive reimbursement up to $20 on atm fees at other banks if you meet the qualifications above.
When we decided to refinance this year, we went back to derek for the refi as well.
Oncu still had the best rates i could find and are awesome to work with.
Both times the process was made very simple.
Derek was very personable, helpful, and quick to respond to questions.
This is the best group to work with.
They  are the most helpful employees ever.
Everyone should bank at one nevada it's the best....
Thank you craig branch for your expertise!
Friends recommended a few different dealerships, but i turned to yelp!
The reviews for centennial caught my attention, as well as a host of positive feedback about cameron walter.
Cameron made the whole experience so easy, stress-free, and straightforward.
Cameron made the whole experience a breeze with his knowledgeable, professional, and personable demeanor.
Financing through azfcu in conjunction with buying from centennial, also helped me shave a half percent off my interest rate.
I also loved that cameron made the whole process quick and efficient!
I arrived in the late morning and was home by lunch!
Thank you, cameron for making my first dealership experience a great one!
I have been with eric james for many years.
Luz has been my go to person.
She is on top of it and i truly appreciate all the work she does for me.
You could not ask for a better group of people and company to work with.
Staff was very helpful and i was able to get the information i needed.
The online banking isn't very good but everyone at the branch was very helpful.
Mac helped us get everything we needed done.
He was very fast and efficient.
He explains everything in super simple terms so that you really understand every step.
I definitely recommend coming to him with anything that you may need.
Never thought i would be reviewing a bank, but that's the beauty of yelp!
You can review so much more than just restaurants!
I have been with this bank for about 8 years or so and have never had a problem with them!
I love their free checking and i have a savings account with them as well.
Their home equity is awesome too- fixed interest rate of 3.25%.
This particular branch has very helpful and friendly employees.
They have a drive thru and it is always quick and easy.
They will even give your dog a treat if they are in the car :).
I've also never experienced long lines in this branch which is always nice!
I have had az state credit union since i was 16 years old.
They have always been fair and their customer service is unequalled.
Keep in mind that they are a non profit institution with their main goal being on bettering the community.
Can you say that about any of these huge corporate banks...?
(maybe i just never see them) anyway, it's new, has mutiple drive up atms.
The employees here care about you and your financial needs and are super friendly.
I really enjoy being a member here and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a local credit union.
You also can't beat their super low rates.
Thank you credit union 1 for being the best i'll never go any where else!
I feel so bad that i forgot his name.
He helped me as soon as i signed my name on the wait list .
He was so nice and kind and answered all the questions i had.
All banks are awful.
There's a bank for everyone and i really wish there was some sort of "which bank is best for you?"
Quiz you could take when you move to toronto to help you decide.
They ship them out at record speed, unlike some of the other banks.
While you can withdraw money from american atms, you can't use debit the way you can with other bank cards.
Bottom line:  this is a no frills bank.
If you're willing to put up with its limitations, you will love it.
This is a good location for me on occassion.
At times i need to pop in and make a deposit or withdrawl.
Lots of parking in the lot and you can access it from thomas or 7th ave.
They are very friendly and try to help you as quick as they can.
They also have a drive thru.
But at times i find it is quicker just to go inside.
This review is for alex.
Alex was the greeter in the afternoon at the 4112 blue diamond rd location on 5/27/2016.
Alex was very prompt to address the customers need.
Alex handled everything how it should be done at all b of as.
So if you still have a account with b of a, please got to this branch.
I've had only positive experiences at this bank.
The service is exceptional!!!
The tellers are great too!
They seem to do much more than a normal teller.
They cut my cashier checks, do my wires, and normal transactions.
But not here the tellers do it all and with a smile!!
Hands down best credit union!!!
I would just like to say how helpful and friendly jackie jamerson was.
She set really took care of me, refreshing change of banks.
Pretty good for a bank.
I'm surprised that there is such a low rating for this bank because i have regularly had good experience here.
Over many years only one really annoying thing and they corrected that.
So my other bank is the most widely hated corporation on the face of the earth.
Maybe that gives me some different perspective.
I'm rarely in the bank for more than a few minutes.
Lines are typically short.
When i need to do something that requires sign in, there is never more than 1 person ahead of me.
My other bank otoh is always long line.
For sign in lately they want to make an appointment and come back in 2 days.
So by comparison i would say that this banks performance is good.
One nevada on craig road in north las vegas has the best customer service.
From the minute you walk in your greeted a hello.
Sabryna jeske is so helpful and is always accommodating .
She is great at understanding exactly what i needed and explaining and following through with everything right away.
If you want great service and great communication with quality standards she's the one to see
Now have bought two cars from tod hale in 3 years.
His service is impeccable.
To quote tod "remember, i work for you".
He is the best!
He found the absolute perfect car for me in northern arizona and it was here within one day.
I will likely work through centennial again and, god willing, tod hale will still be there!
I only used the atm here, but it was clean, well lit and i felt very safe.
I liked that i didn't have to open my door to use it!
Thanks mackenzie for making time for my loan and helping me reschedule my appointment.
I bought my kia soul from tod hale and the total experience was wonderful.
I have a very busy life and no time to step foot in a dealership and get stuck.
Tod made this happen for me.
He didn't even get irritated when i completely changed my mind to a different vehicle.
There was never any high pressure sales going on.
I will never buy a vehicle from anyone else!
Sergio was awesome throughout my whole home buying process.
From day one he showed great communication and explained anything i didn't fully understand.
His work ethic speaks for its self so if you're looking for a professional look no further.
He got me approved fast and easy and delivered when my previous lender couldn't.
Sergio also speaks spanish which came in handy when my mom had any concerns that she couldn't understand in english.
Overall i would recommend sergio to anyone looking for a lender.
I will without a doubt go to him again for any future home buying needs.
I've come here a few times and am always impressed by how clean and organized it is.
I've purchased a few items, all at really good prices.
On top of that, you almost always get really good service, like you're in a traditional store.
This is my fav pawn shop to visit!
Thankfully, they allowed a close friend of mine who still resides in az go in and extend it for me.
Which was very nice of them because i know the restrictions when it comes to liability and ownership.
I received it yesterday, packaged with care and no harm done.
I'm very thankful for their service and i would recommend this store to anyone.
They also have pretty cool stuff in there.
I have banked here for a few years now.
I cannot appreciate the personal banker ivy zhang for all her help.
I work in a customer service driven industry, thus i have high standards which are not usually met.
I am so grateful for ivy and all her help to resolve my concerns.
I was pleased with the service i received.
I walked out with my new debit card in hand and everything was easy and convenient.
Maria moran was great.
So helpful and took care of my car loan refi quickly with little hassle.
Started process online and completed in office.
Fast, and saving almost 3% apr!
Thanks maria and one nevada.
This credit union helped me get my finances and credit score together.
The staff is extremely friendly and i'm always greeted warmly.
I've been banking here for over a year now and couldn't imagine going anywhere else with my money.
I've recommended friends here and they thank me to the moon and back.
It was a very busy day and i got the pleasure of working with rebecca.
I had come in looking for my info for direct deposit.
Thank you rebecca your doing a great job!
I love how friendly and outgoing you are.
Mountain america credit union is a shared branch that my credit union partners with.
Ever since my credit union moved from the northwest to henderson i've been coming here for simple transactions.
So far i've had no problems.
Lines can get long depending on the time of day but they do move fairly quickly.
Employees are always helpful and friendly :)
Service is generally good, hours are good and they are open on sunday.
Parking is available, but can be limited.
I got it resolved, but it did cause me some grief and stress, although very briefly.
There's isn't an overwhelming number of options to choose from.
If you do some homework about what you like and where your budget it, it helps.
I worked with gaylon, who was very laid back and helpful.
I didn't feel like i was being sold.
I said price was my priority and he listened.
He worked through a lot of options for me.
I like that i got to test drive the cars alone and could focus on the car and the drive.
I also asked a billion questions about all the paperwork and he was on top of it.
It's all about the drive through atm.
And the tellers inside are always really friendly and helpful.
I've always had a pleasant experience at this branch.
Too many advantages over banks!
Lower fees and no fees in many cases!
You are a member/owner and are treated as such even if you only have a few dollars in your account!!!
The process of leasing my new car through oneaz credit union and centennial was so easy and quick.
I couldn't imagine using anyone else for this process.
I've been a member of silver state since i was a small child.
The service is great and their mobile app is super easy to use.
The best part is pretty much every 7-11 atm is free!!
Gisela was very helpful with everything i needed !
Come bank with one nevada credit union !
I am a recent convert to silver state school credit union.
Luckily i married a ssscu member!
I decided to switch over because this bank was so much better than the one i was with before hand.
Now speaking of this branch specifically...such a great location!
Many of ssscus are located within grocery stores.
And remember, you never wake up a sleeping baby, if you don't have too!
This location also has a branch available for when you need to speak with someone personally.
What a blast it is to be in and out without having to waste an hour just waiting in line.
The people at ssscu are also quite lovely.
Everyone is happy and nice.
It is also a pleasure to walk in because everyone smiles at you if you catch their eye.
I hope it always stays that way.
Tod hale was awesome to work with!
I had a wonderful experience and am thrilled with my purchase!
(note - i previously met with another consultant and had a very different experience.
After seeing countless positive reviews for tod online i decided to give centennial another chance.
If you go, ask for tod!)
I am disappointed with the detailing job (i initially saw the car and agreed to purchase prior to detailing).
I wiped the seats and inside handles with a wet rag and dirt came off right away.
I came in on a saturday to cash my check and get a cashiers check.
Jackie help me and she was amazing.
I work a lot so i have to do things on saturday in this branch is always very friendly..
Gisela was very kind & courteous!
Thx u gisela for doing such a wonderful job in explaining everything when opening my new account,  much appreciated...
Great service at this branch.
Went in to open a savings account and it was so quick and easy.
The staff was also very friendly!
I would definitely consider doing this in the future.
Thank you one nevada for the great service.
You may see me in the future.
My bank for life now !
Awesome customer service !
Been banking here for 6 years and never had one problem.
Staff is very nice and caring.
They always look out for the customers.
Lines are sometimes long, especially during lunch.
Would recommend more employees.
Overall a good bank
Susan was incredibly composed, and did her very best to be patient and polite, despite obviously being flustered.
Be kind to these people!
Best rates and deals.
What more could i ask for?
I was told about this location and when started on the tour it took me through sun city grand.
I always thought you couldn't get in this neighborhood without living here or that there were shops around here.
I'm a big fan of citibank, and this is my local branch.
Haven't had any problems here.
Atm spits out $100's, which is awesome.
Staff is very knowledgeable.
I even picked up a 1930's $100 bill the last time i made a withdrawal... how cool is that?
Recently moved to town and -- obviously -- had to find a new bank.
The various yelp reviews left in me fairly uncertain about what to do.
It may be that things like banking services aren't so easy to evaluate in this format.
There are many, many variables with banking services and many ways that people can have a less-than-ideal experience.
My main interest is with the basics of checking and savings.
I'm not currently in the market for lending.
My experience has been generally positive.
Folks at the credit union were helpful in my setup phase.
The online banking system is not the most user-friendly one i've encountered, but it seems passable.
Joe was great to work with.
My aunt had an issue while she was on vacation with her account be double charged by a hotel.
When they could not get it resolved, the bank reviewed the account and refunded her the money.
The bank said they will address the corporate office of the hotel to get a refund.
I have always had great experiences here...never a problem.
Always friendly and efficient with all my transactions.
They shred for free.....i love that.
Super helpful and well informed.
I had a great experience with derek taylor on my home mortgage.
He was quick to respond to my questions and always took the time to give me detailed answers.
My first experience with mortgage lenders wasn't that great, so it was a pleasant surprise working with derek.
April and maria were amazing!
No waiting time and great customer service!
They took the time to explain the account and perks offered to members and answered all of our questions.
I appreciate them taking the time give a genuine smile...it goes a long way with customers!
Derek taylor and cely farinas have made our interactions with one nevada credit union an absolute dream come true.
We recently closed on our second house and derek has been with us on both.
We whole heartedly recommend derek to all our friends and coworkers and recommend him to anyone reading this.
Went in to open an account, rep listened to what my intentions for the account were and made a recommendation.
Rep was very pleasant and personable.
We have now landed at the summerlin bank of america.
Yes bank of america,  ahh the mcdonalds of all banks.
Which by the way, this location happens to be across from the mcdonalds drive thru.
This bank is always efficient and is very clean.
Tellers are friendly and branch manager candice always greets me with a smile.
Its this kind of professionalism and customer service that deserves to be recognized.
I'm in and out in literally less than 3 minutes when using the atm inside.
This branch has helped is out with business accounts, car loan, mortgage, and personal accounts.
My loan officer was derek taylor.
Honest and professional .
Every email with a bunch of questions i sent him was replied within an hour.
Gave me the "record low" rate.
And i saved another $2000 because one nevada credit union charge less fees.
I will refer everybody to him.
My overall experience with one nevada credit union is very very very positive!
Easy to use app, all credit cards, debit cards, car loans and house mortgage is in one place.
Check deposits are as easy as snapping a picture.
Crazy  did i tell you i have credit card here?
One nevada credit union freaking awesome low low low rate credit card with big big limit.
Like almost no limit credit card!
Great security if you have a seasonal job.
Just in & out, no lines, no hassles
I am teenage girl who recently had frod on my account.
Yesterday i went in to try to locate some private information stored in an old account.
Joseph castoire (i took his card) helped me.
I thank him for how much time he took to try to uncover the needed info.
Another very nice lady was helping too, don't have name.
Drive thru atm's , walk up atm's , no public restrooms, in the 99 cent shopping center.charleston/decatur.
There can be some lines here.
Friendly tellers very efficient
I would give this place 6-stars if i could.
I've been with pc for probably five years now.
There's things they are good at (i.e.
Actually paying you interest and limiting bank fees) and some things they're not great at (i.e.
Dealing in foreign currencies, not having real physical banking locations, etc.).
I like that my savings account actually grows.
I like that i can use cibc machines without service charges.
I like the online banking.
My daily withdraw allowance is $1000, not to mention additional (i think $5000) for debit transactions.
Now have email money transfers...ftw!
---not recommended for--- 1.
People who want to see a teller 2.
People who don't understand how to online bank 3.
Those with bad credit (as this may limit your cash withdraw limit) 4.
Love this credit union!
Customer service is incredible and the tellers are very friendly.
I always have an enjoyable experience here.
They also offer a free notary which is super convenient.
I will never go to a dealership again!
I was referred here by my bank, so i gave them a call.
I took a drive down there and there it was, the car of my dreams!!.
Eric made the process so simple and was so very sweet to work with.
I highly recommend this place if you're in the market for a new ride!
Josue mac helped my husband and i tremendously today.
Definitely coming back to him next time we need anything.
Plus their office is always clean and super quick.
I like going in this my local branch bank.
Tito is an excellent manager and eli is very good to.
But venessa is superb.
She has the best customer service skills ever....what a doll.
She treats every customer like a they have a million dollars in the bank.
Thank you, liz henning!
You are an absolute gem, and everyone should bank at cuwest in prescott arizona because of you.
One nevada is still the best.
Suze was professional and informed, something that is becoming so rare in customer service.
She hooked me up with bill payer and answered all of my questions so patiently.
Great service and they really figure out the best route to take in what u want to accomplish.
Linda was very efficient and friendly made me feel very comfortable!!!!
I like going in this my local branch bank.
Tito is an excellent manager and eli is very good to.
But venessa is superb.
She has the best customer service skills ever....what a doll.
She treats every customer like they have a million dollars in the bank!
I've purchased two cars from them and have worked with 4 of their consultants.
They are incredibly responsive without being pushy or overbearing.
My wife and i came in for an auto loan and rebecca and samantha assisted us.
Thank you both for the excellent work.
Unfortunately, i've just had a very bad experience with people at this branch.
I was given misinformation regarding a very important loan, and there is no one taking responsibility.
Usually, i have great interactions here, but you should double and triple check any information you are given.
I was immediately contacted by rebecca (thank you!)
After posting my review and i'm happy to say that i feel better than ever about banking here.
I've been a member of ssscu for 25 years now, and i wouldn't go anywhere else!
It depends on what time of day you arrive, this branch can get very busy.
Which makes the line move a bit slow despite most teller windows are open.
I have been banking with citi for 6 years and haven't had any issues.
You also get free wire transfers to other banks.
How do they do that?
For atm services, you can use any scotia bank atm free of charge.
Oh, and one last thing, if you need to get international transfers, tangerine does not have a swift key.
If that is something you need often, you will need an account in another bank.
This bank is very convenient!
Anytime i come here it only takes 5 minutes until i finish with everything i have to do.
The personal is always very helpful and friendly.
Also the parking in this location is good.
This is my first time banking with af .
This branch has the most helpful and wonderful employees.
I am so pleased they are close to my house!
They are always knowledgeable regarding products and services, and if they aren't sure, they find out instead of guessing.
I love the hours open on sunday!
I only come to this location!
I feel comfortable sitting with bankers they always know what they're doing.
Thank you for making the whole process so painless and hassle free!
The staff is very professional, attentive, and friendly.
We got our home refinanced in less than a month!
On 9/30/16 we found the perfect home in sedona, az.
Being from ny, we had no idea how home purchases worked in az, or even where to turn.
Searching yelp, we found pcm.
They are knowledgeable and easy to work with.
They also used e-signatures to move things along when we could not be in az.
When we first spoke with zac, the goal was to have thanksgiving in sedona.
We could not have done it without zac, sharon and tyler's support.
It was great team work and excellent service.
We highly recommend them.
I've been a regular to this location for the last 4 years or so.
I was sad when she transferred.
Today i decided to leave them for a branch closer to my home.
There was a small misunderstanding in the process, but chelsea p resolved it quickly.
She is nice, smart and customer oriented (rare combination these days).
I wish they had people like this at every location.
As a first time home buyer, jeremy and his team made this process a breeze!
I would absolutely recommend them to anyone, as well as use them again when the time comes.
They are all very friendly and responsive to any communication.
I never had any questions left unanswered.
Thank you so much to pinnacle capital for helping me buy my first home!
The atm here is a true cu$ credit union alliance atm.
Surcharge free for all credit unions who are part of the alliance nationwide.
I'm from pa and didn't pay a surcharge.
Thank you, first credit union for honest and ethical business practices!
I want to give a special thanks to eduardo c. thanks so much for displaying such exemplary customer service.
As a professional in the customer services world.
I tip my hat off to you and your professional conduct.
Unfortunately i lost my wallet a couple nights ago and was a bit on edge the past couple days.
I have to get new cards, go to dmv, yada yada yada.
Krystina was my banker and she was very sweet and professional.
Made my week that much better getting my new debit card and cash in mah bank asap.
Def recommend her if you have any problems!
Everybody here is so friendly.
First time using the drive thru.
There are 3 lanes going right now.
Dont forget they have a notary for their customers.
I have used ing direct (ing) for high rate savings for a few years.
I am happy with the online services that i have received so far.
Per my experience, the website is easy to maneuver, and the transfer instructions are executed in a reliable manner.
This is a testimony of how well the software is written.
There is no minimum balance requirement, and is no fee for unlimited transactions.
I have never used its mortgage service, so i cannot attest to it.
It, though, has competitive posted rates.
Ing was bought by scotia bank (bns) in 2012.
Only time will tell if these high rates will stay.
In the meantime, ing customers enjoy the good time as long as it lasts.
After some changes with rude tellers the bank is much improved.
I wish they had more than two tellers at all times.
Makes the wait time longer.
Gave 4 stars because the mortage department is top notch and stays on top of things.
We have some parent loans for our kids' college tuition which will be paid off by our kids.
Without my income, our debt to income ratio was a little high.
A large chunk of our income is being excluded!
We went with lender 1 who said we could not be approved till we sold our house.
They were not very knowledgable!
Lender 3 was fine, but would not return e-mails and calls.
Then they went on vacation too.
I went online and googled lenders.
We found marc trejo.
It was a long shot, but i called and talked to him.
I told him we were in a time crunch.
We found a house we loved, and we wanted to make an offer before someone else did.
Marc had us approved in less than 24 hours or the same day, can't remember.
He answered all e-mails in a timely manner.
We appreciated his help.
When we purchased our first two homes 22 and 15 years ago, it was easy.
This time around working with lenders was very difficult till we got marc.
For people with excellent credit, it should be easy.
We did have some complications, but marc helped us work around things.
He is definitely an efficient worker.
My kind of guy!
I like getting things done asap, so we will work with him again if and when we buy another home.
Where is the direction of banking heading?
You walk into the banks now and it's either empty or extremely busy depending on the timeframe you visit.
The fact that they have replaced about 3 tellers or more, for some of these virtual atm's is scary.
Walked right in no line 2 tellers!
It was ghost town like none of the cubicles were filled with bankers and the tellers were ummm there..
Very good customer service the teller who helped me was very professional and processed my transaction fast!
What else can i ask for?
I bank here all the time and have come to expect the decent service that they offer.
The tellers and other staff are always helpful and go beyond what is expected.
That being said, all else is good.
Jason and his team are very helpful.
They are always knowledgeable and ready to help with any questions you may have.
I would definitely recommend them to anyone that is in need for a good insurance team.
I've always had great service at this branch.
Tellers are friendly and fast, and even visits with a banker are quick.
I've never had to wait in a line, and they always get me in and out, i really appreciate that.
They have great communication and competitive interest rates.
This by far is my favorite chase bank to go to.
The staff is always extremely kind and fun to talk to.
The location is very clean and nice to be in.
The staff is always very helpful and knowledgeable.
If human interaction isn't your thing, the atms on the outside are easy to use.
Food was great, generous portions, they piled on the entrees, despite the to go box already pretty full.
Didn't see any old lady maybe that's why.
Just experienced great things here.
Simple but nice gesture.
Always friendly staff, quick service and a pleseant experience.
I have to say that i have had a lot of time with different insurance companies.
This one has been one of the better ones.
Since i have a lot to insure, it is a big deal to find a good one.
They have insurance for all sorts of veichiles and homes, but not motor couches.
It is at times hard to find someone or a company to meet all your needs.
They do also do life plannning as far as insurance for death benneys and all.
It is  a good cpmpany and has been around for many years.
I think you should give them a try.
Very professional thorough timely abs accurate.....all great features in the mortgage process
I own and operate a business out if tempe, however i live 2 min from this branch location.
The staff here always goes out of their way to help me and are extremely friendly.
Every time i walk in here, i feel like a vip.
Most services i use charge no fee, which is a welcome change compared to wells fargo or bank of america.
This location provides prompt attentive service.
Member since 1984 and still very pleased.
Was able to apply for car loan with phone while traveling, then swing by this branch to accept paperwork.
Rates always competitive as well.
I've went to a couple other bofa's in vegas and this is the only one i go to now.
Leslie always has the best customer experience.always so helpful and eager any questions i may have
The parking lot is really empty, but i take it's because it is a new location..
Recently came in to open a checking account after researching other federal cu because you can never be too certain.
I went to the teller and the guy helped me set up some part.
It was odd to me that it doesn't have that bank atmosphere.
All the tellers are all professional but they talk amongst each other and have no dividers, unlike other banks.
All in all i was at sce for less than 20 minutes and it was a great first time experience.
Having jeremy schachter as our lender was the best experience my husband and i could have asked for.
This is the second time we purchased a home, and the process with jeremy far exceeded our initial home buying.
- jeremy is detailed and a clear communicator.
- he is patient and kind, always willing to answer any of our questions.
His team was also constantly available to us.
He was truly on our side the whole time.
I cannot recommend jeremy highly enough; he is the best of the best!
Contact the pinnacle capital mortgage family!
You will not regret it.
From response time, to options, to honesty, and to service level, the team here is nothing short of awesome!
Buying a house is a very stressful time, but jeremy and his team were amazing throughout the whole process.
Jeremy is extremely responsive, which i really appreciate.
He walked us through every step of the way and communicated throughout the whole process.
He even called and congratulated us when our house closed.
He explained things clearly and was very patient and professional.
We were ready to make an offer on a house on a sunday and didn't have a letter of prequalification.
Jeremy was out of town, but he had someone else available to provide that for us.
He totally had us covered in his absence.
I would highly recommend jeremy to anyone buying a house.
Finally a branch near me.
I dreaded the days i had to drive far north or south to handle things with my bank.
Staff is always friendly and helpful.
Jeremy and his team assisted me in buying my first historic home in downtown phoenix.
Jeremy truly cares about his clients and his team is extremely professional and service oriented.
This process can be complicated but jeremy and his team made it run smoothly with zero surprises!
You just select the account you want to deposit the money in and you can combine both cash and checks.
My husband and i relocated from boston to phoenix.
Even with jeremy going on an overseas vacation, we didn't miss a beat.
Zach pitched in and kept things running smoothly.
The entire team was friendly and went above and beyond.
They responded immediately to our questions, no matter the day or time.
We would recommend pinnacle wholeheartedly!
Great help getting my issues taken care of with my account!!!
Thank you :)) their bankers are extremely friendly and know their stuff.
Sigh of relief when my problem was solved within a matter of hours.
I highly recommend wells fargo, especially for small businesses and sole proprietors.
I wanted to give this business five stars, but the reality is they are, after all, bankers!
But as far as my lobby visits are concerned, they have all been swell.
There is sometimes a wait, because they normally only have one teller working.
But other than that, most people here are nice and helpful.
If you come here enough, they will know you, due to its small size of staff.
Great working with the tellers they are always friendly helpful.
We have many different types of accounts with them for the past 10 years
Sontino graham gave us the best service you could receive.
Definitely recommend going to him
The short version:  i can't imagine having worked with anyone else for our first mortgage.
Through every single step of the process, he was all we hoped for and beyond.
We also had several "what about...?
", "how does ...
General questions about home financing throughout the process, and he was equally responsive and thorough.
We wanted to close asap, and jeremy and his team was *on it*.
Jeremy personally attended our closing.
Even after closing in mid-february, jeremy has been available still to answer questions.
Been banking with them since before they ever dreamed of being a wells fargo.
This is my closest branch location to work nowadays and i've been using them frequently in my "extreme adulting".
Aka: investing and nerding out about iras and all that.
Anyways, i'm gonna spare the internet bots my personal info.
Staff here has been incredibly observant, reliable and helpful.
However, it seems like many of them talk really fast and have accents to boot.
Makes things a little hard to understand.
Best advice i can give: slow it down a little!
When you inevitably do end up asking many questions though, they will answer them and explain them fully.
You always have to make sure to read the fine print and ask every question.
They've never once made me feel stupid for asking a question.
Seems lots of people are lighting up wells fargo, bank of america and basically all of the banks these days.
I'm not picky about banks and i'm not threatening to run off with another bank and move my money.
I don't think wells fargo or bank of america are any better than the other.
They're just huge financial institutions where we all keep our money so we can use it on the daily.
Nothing more, nothing less in my opinion.
Staff was very helpful and very professional.
Like most chase branches here in arizona customer service is superb.
I've banked with chase for a while now and i love my experience every time i go into a branch.
Truwest credit union is awesome!
I enjoy banking with them.
They provide great customer service and the employees are very knowledgeable of the different services they offer.
If you need help, go see kayla williams.
She is patient and knows what she's doing.
Whether it's opening/closing accounts, offering financial advice, anything, see kayla williams.
I'm leaving my bank to bank at wells fargo and kayla is a lot of the reason why.
I hate talking to people about money, but she is understanding and so so so helpful!
Samuel gave me excellent customer service!!
He greeted me with a smile and asked how my day was going!
I wouldn't go elsewhere!!
Thank you samuel for your wonderful customer service!!!
We couldn't speak more highly about nor recommend more enthusiastically jeremy and his team of top notch professionals.
They made the process as easy to follow and navigate as possible, and even made it fun at times.
If you're thinking about buying a home, call jeremy at pinnacle.
I have closed three home loans with mary vrana and her team over the past 6 years.
Each time has been exceptional.
They are always easy to work with and very professional with strong communication and follow through skills.
Their interest rates and terms are very competitive.
I have closed on a fha, va, and conventional loans that have always closed on time.
Save yourself a lot of time and money by giving sun american mortgage a call for your next home loan.
There was literally no wait to speak to a banker to assist me.
Going into the bank is a pain.
But if there were more bankers like lakiesha it would no longer be so tedious.
Jeremy and his team are the gold standard!
I couldn't have been more pleased with the loan process and their dedication to helping us secure our loan.
They are dependable, professional and honest.
They made the process so efficient and easy.
The answered all of our questions quickly and clearly.
The video updates about the process and what to expect were great.
I also have access to his account online.
And the reason i'm giving a simple bank five stars?
They called the next day to make sure that i was extremely satisfied.
I've never had bofa call me to make sure i was satisfied!
It's the little things!
I absolutely love being a chase customer.
They have been so terrific to me.
I used to bank with wells fargo and bank of america and i would never go back.
Thank you chase for never letting me down.
I am a customer for life.
This is my go to bank.
I am forever grateful as i am still very young- 16. and i dont know too much about money management.
Jeremy schachter helped one of my closest friends with her mortgage.
He was extremely professional and delivered on all promises including delivering a fantastic rate and excellent customer service.
He was always available for questions and addressed all concerns in a professional manner.
I will absolutely be using jeremy schachter and pinnacle for my new mortgage on my next home mortgage.
My first few stops included long waits & longer application forms.
Erica asked a few questions and suggested the perfect account for my needs.
This bank is open 7 days a week & they waive charges at non- midfirst atms!
L look forward to being a customer at midfirst.
This branch has got the best employees.
Jeffery and savannah were extremely helpful and knowledgeable about everything.
They both led me in the right direction and gave me future advice on my next loan.
Thank you savannah and jeffery.
If you need help with anything at this bank this branch and their staff are the best.
Nfcu should give them recognition for all they do especially with dealing with call center people.
These guys are the face of navy federal.
She was friendly, outgoing, and warm.
I cannot say enough good things about her.
She went above and beyond.
I will only go if she is there.
Exceeded all of my expectations.
I have been with them for over 10 years.
The staff is always friend and willing to help.
Never had a problem!!
So far so good!
They're also compatible with my los angeles federal acct.
The tellers are also very polite
I would consider opening a chase account based on my experience at this location.
Plus they have free cookies =)
I am a mortgage broker and am always in need of someone to help my clients acquire hazard insurance.
I would recommend sean to everyone without hesitation.
Hands down the most friendly staff!!
In the history of ever....
Every time... so i always leave with a smile or a laugh thank you
26 year customer here- i think duvel is one of those insurance agents that you don't come around anymore.
I think when all of your friends use the same agent you can really say it's a "neighborhood" insurance agency.
Even after having graduated from college i haven't looked elsewhere because i really love this bank.
Now it's been about 6 years since i've done my personal banking with them and at this location.
Zac has made this process extremely smooth and has been really attentive.
I would highly recommend pinnacle capital and zac to anyone!
To my surprise and delight, i had absolutely no wait!
Nice seating area for waiting.
The tellers are well protected with the security glass.
Service was fast and efficient.
Saw 2 atms which were both inside the building.
Did not notice any outside or any drive up atm either.
Parking is a bit tight.
Almost witnessed an accident when we were there.
For the most part, i wish all my experiences at b of a branches were like this.
The best bank in las vegas!
Easy to work with, no monthly fees, only one dollar to open & great customer service!
Thank you america first!!
Zac and his team are incredible!
He was insanely fast with providing our pre-qual letter as well as processing everything for our loan.
While we don't have previous home buying experience to compare, we can tell that zac is absolutely top notch!
If you want someone who is responsive and knowledgable, zac is the guy to go to!
I am not a yelper but i am so impressed by midfirst bank and this location i had to.
I only wish i could give them more than five stars.
Every employee is beyond fantastic and their hours are not to even being close to being competed with.
I have only used the drive through...these are the nicest tellers i've ever encountered.
Fast, friendly and great are the words i can describe founders.
They are a great place to bank with.
I have been with them since 2011.
They call you when they see unusual charges to your account.
Forget bb&t, bank of america or wells fargo.
This place is the ideal place to handle your cash.
That's where a place like this comes in.
You give them your money, then when you need it back, you just go ask for it.
They have these things you can write on, to make it so you can give your money to other people.
You then give them more money than you took out to begin with.
You can do the same for the purchase of an abode.
You can spread out the abode payments for up to 30 years, how crazy is that?
They do other things to either take more of your money, or make it so you have more money.
And all this time, i had kept my money under the bed.
This place is amazing.
He's very informative and makes banking or whatever it's called!
I'm gonna go bank next week to set some more stuff up!
Go here if you want great friendly service
Level of service, awesome!!!
Everyone smiles and says hello the moment you enter the bank and everyone is eager to be of service.
Good business hours too.
Fast and friendly drive thru service.
The layout is different than most banks i've been too, but it works for their location.
You have to press the send button to get the tube,but easy peasy.
We just moved all.of our accounts to this bank.
They were very helpful in setting up a new business account and moving the rest of our personal accounts.
Michael the bank president was great to work with, and i would recommend them to anyone.
I'm leaving a happy customer and would highly recommend this branch to anyone in the area!
Just opened an account and refi my truck loan.
Easy process, great service, super friendly, smiles and great corporate phone service as well!
So far so good!
Please don't change like one nevada fcu whose deteriorated significantly over the years!
Jeremy really worked hard to get a quick closing and a competitive offer for me.
He stayed in touch and came to signing for closing.
He really earned my business.
This is our second time at refinancing with jeremy.
It could not have gone better.
He was great to work with and got us financed at an incredible rate in a very short time.
He makes the whole process effortless.
I would definitely recommend him to everyone.
I couldn't be happier.
My wife and i have worked with pcm a few times over the past 10 years and are truly impressed.
They have always been on the top of their game and are extremely professional.
Fast, efficient and thorough are just a few words that describes how they handle their business.
They treat you like family and above all with respect.
Zac white delivered on all his promises.
I went with this company based on reviews of what other people's experience was like.
I was expecting this to be a long drawn out process.
I couldn't have been more wrong.
Zac worked tirelessly with his company to get this done.
I would get responses by email within hours even during nights and weekends.
If you're looking to refinance look no further.
These guys are an a+ company!!!
Will recommend them to everyone.
Thank you again zac  cale mccann
What an amazing experience.
He walked us through the process step-by-step and made us feel like we were his only client.
Day or night jeremy and his team were available for questions and any concerns along the way.
This all resulted in finding the prefect house to make our home.
Today i went to wells fargo & it wouldn't allow me to take money out of my savings.
Right after i was driving off i got a text & call.
Both verifying that i was the one who tried to take money out of my account.
5 stars for sure!
Last week i called them and they were beyond helpful, they went over and above to help me.
Very professional and respectful!
I don't write too many reviews, but they deserve a big thank you for their help!
Robin d apparently doesn't know how exchange rates work.
Excellent value every time and almost 1/10th the cost of td.
Please calforex, start carrying isk!
The bank rates suck!
Jeremy, sharon, and tyler at pinnacle capital mortgage are wonderful!
They helped me refinance my home and really made sure i had all of my questions answered at all times.
The software they use to keep your file and paperwork submissions going is very easy to use and quite convenient.
I visited for the first time happened to be in the neighborhood needed a debit card.
The banker was fast and professional.
Great branch and staff
After some online research went into this location and worked with kenny, who was amazing (all while under the weather).
He was quick and polite and really helpful.
I am so pleased to make this switch and cannot wait to do eveything through them all for free!!
Sean and his team are the best!!
Always responsive and super helpful.
I definitely recommend sean overlock!
Easy and painless process, will definitely recommend this branch if you are in the area.
I have been attempting to set up a checking account all over town.
Most banks had high fees, check holds and all kinds of hoops to jump through.
Also, the other banks staff was not all that helpful.
Go to wells fargo at  2501 sth rainbow blvd, on the sth west corner on rainbow & sahara.
Ask for amitra burks.
She made this experience easy, understandable, welcoming and fun!!
As long as i am to be living in vegas, i will do all my banking with, amitra!
My favorite people at my favorite financial institution are at this navy federal location by luke afb.
I know just about all the faces every time i walk in and it's always a comfortable feeling.
They've helped me with all sorts of banking needs, from home, to auto loans, credit cards, multiple accts, etc etc.
I've never had any issues with them and i'm glad they exist.
I can't wait for them to open up a closer location as this one and mesa are very far apart.
Jeremy and his team were amazing to work with.
Despite the extra work involved, jeremy handled everything beautifully and we were able to close when we needed to.
Of utmost importance to me, jeremy was extremely responsive to every (sometimes ridiculous) questions that i had.
Would recommend him to anyone looking to buy in phoenix.
Gave it 4 stars.. great first time but i do not trust banks in general..
So i'll update after 6 months of how service is really treating me!
This branch is tricky (on the corner of spring mnt and arville.
Diagonally across from arco gas station).
Parking is confusing ..
I saw the atm center that was in the back and realized coming in from spring mnt was difficult.
I advise using arvilles side.
Met with bridgette right away - who i give the 3 stars too!!
Great customer service floats my boat and hearing about wells fargos banking service added one more star.
* keep in mind my grandmother said to not bank with them , for some odd reason ?
Older people know what's best but i am taking a leap of faith !
Great experience on the inside of this big branch!
One happy and new customer.
I'm always greeted with a smile and attentive quick service.
As far as banks go, chase has provided far superior service than any other bank i have ever used.
Decided to go with a credit union over my main stream bank that kept charging me fees for stupid reasons.
Went into this location and had a great experience.
They had my accounts setup and a real usable check card exteremely fast.
My old bank took days and 3 weeks to get my check cards in the mail.
So far so good when you go in ask for bebe she is extremely nice and helpful.
This is the best bank out there.
I would never wanna leave this bank.
I love it !!
The staff is always really nice and helpful as well
Convenient location, great hours, and a notary always on site.
I was rushing to buy a car to replace my old one which had finally broken down.
Anyways, lexis helped me by throwing out all of my previous applications and started all over with me.
She warned that my check wouldn't be available until monday because their main offices in utah were already closed.
She's the reason i was able to buy the car that i wanted.
Excellent customer service and really good auto loan rates especially for someone like me with new credit.
At this particular establishment they were acting with urgency.
Perhaps i will need to time my next visit better, but kudos to the team for hustling!
I have been a wells fargo customer for over ten years.
This is a great branch to frequent.
The branch i went to prior to moving to scottsdale was horrible.
They would sell me accounts that i didn't need and their speed was sub par.
This branch is none of those.
They even offer you water on a hot day!
Glad to be using this branch now.
Jeremy and his team were awesome!!!
The mortgage process with pinnacle was seem less.
We had a va loan which sometimes can  be cumbersome.
We closed 10 days ahead of schedule.
Jeremy's team worked with us all online which was great for us since my husband travels extensively.
If we ever get another mortgage it will be with pinnacle.
I highly recommend this company!!!!
This is another full service bank.
This branch is convenient to the southside.
It has an atm as well as drive through tellers.
They get an extra star for this as well a parking in the crowded carson street area.
I bank elsewhere, but i lived closer would consider this bank because of these time saving features.
Banks arent my favorite, but i have met quite a few bankers i like here.
I have used their app to make appts.
You can chose a locaton where you would like the appointment and let them know what your needs are.
I'm always greeted with a smile and attentive quick service.
As far as banks go, chase has provided far superior service than any other bank i have ever used.
I was here today to alter some of my accounts and had no issues.
To this day switching my bank of bank of america is the best thing i have ever done.
Area lighting was a huge plus because you won't fear for your life of being robbed.
It's across the street from paradise valley mall.
Multiple lanes of drive-thru windows and atm's.
Chase helps you with your problems right away!
If someone steals from you they get your money back faster than any other bank!
The atm works great.
Bank is  a bank so nothing too special.
I mainly come here to move cash between my accounts
I would recommend this location to anyone looking to take care of the banking needs.
(when did you move here, why did you move here, etc).
These are not necessary to open a checking account.
The easier and quicker the sign-up process is the better chance for 5 stars in the future from new customers.
I don't get the other reviews here.
This is the only wells fargo branch i use, as the customer service is superior, helpful and efficient.
We have been with state farm insurance since 1986, so over 30 years now.
We began with an agent in pa, and transferred everything to karen wright's office when we moved here in 2000.
We have all of our policies with her and state farm.
On those rare occasions when we have had a claim, there were no problems at all.
She and her staff are competent and friendly.
I needed a cashiers check and they handled my request very quickly and efficiently.
Jim dankwardt was very kind, knowledgeable and professional.
That's why i love doing business with us bank.
They are definitely the financial institution you want on your side when it comes to request like this.
This is my preferred royal bank branch.
Great customer service and convenient location/drive up!
They have a nice app you can download on your phone to use too!
But be prepared to wait... and wait... and wait....
Doesn't matter if there are 7 staff members and only 2 customers.
They're slooooow, but very friendly.
I admit banks scare me, which is why i banked with washington mutual.
Their set up made going to the bank less intimidating.
However, time has passed, and as we have become frequent users of this chase location, my fear has subsided.
The tellers are always smiling, and they know us by name.
They even take the time to get to know a bit more about us.
I have never had a problem here.
Conveniently located, and usually isn't busy for long.
It's always in and out which is what i'm going for.
Oh, lots of parking space too :)
Zac white does it again!
Always helpful and ready to get you what you need!
We just refinanced again to get some money out the loan.
Everything is very smooth and the ball keeps rolling!
I'm so thankful for this company as this is my third time dealing with them.
In future if the interest rates lower i will be in search of him again!!!
Thank you guys again!
Extremely courteous, friendly and managed very well!
Our experience was fabulous.
The process went smoothly and we even closed early.
Jeremy was personable and professional.
Dare i say memorable?
If you work with him he will send video clips that explain each step of the loan process.
They are hilarious and informative.
I highly recommend jeremy and his team.
To say jeremy is the best just isn't enough, he's the only broker anyone should ever work with.
Every question/concern we had - and we had many - he got back to us right away.
We honestly couldn't be happier.
I know the first week of the month this branch has lines out the door or close to it.
I normally use the atm or mobile banking great alternatives.
However, i had to go in for a cashiers check.
I love this branch.
Always excellent service whether for personal banking or business banking.
Had a great experience today with a personal banker.
Great staff  very busy location  wish it had a drive thu
Jeremy kept me abreast of every stage in the process and was in constant communication.
Go see them if you need a mortgage.
I promise you wont be disappointed!
Great exchange rate and super fast!
Their service is great and its easy to get in and out within 10 minutes.
I will be back again next time for my currency exchange needs.
Ok, i'm writing another review on a bank, but i feel this branch deserves better than 1 star rating.
I was in there recently with my son to open up a teen account.
Melynda was our personal banker who helped us set this up.
It was very easy and we were in and out of there in about 30 minutes.
They provided water while we waited too.
Melynda also explained to my son how everything worked and she was very patient.
I would recommend melynda to anyone.
The staff are friendly and courteous.
I saw many people gave the bank poor rating.
Because they expected bank of china same liked international banks.
If they have been to china.
They will appreciate the bank of china in toronto is follow the operating standard in china.
Dear wells fargo on central,  i consider this bank my home bank.
I tend to gravitate here most, between all of the wells fargo spread across the valley, its my favorite.
Sometimes there is a water bottle cooler, like that and most of all on friday they have fresh cookies, why?
I guess to keep customers like me happy.
You can go to the normal personal line, merchant teller, or drive thru.
Every person here is great.
Thank you britney for helping me out of a sticky situation.
Like all navy federals, this one treats you with respect.
Never had a bad experience and do lots of business with them.
I'm not sure what that one commenter below said about fees etc.
Free checking, savings, atm... best rates on other financial products... so definitely don't want to misinform out there.
It doesn't get much better than navy federal as far as handling your day to day money goes.
My experience  at the credit union was awesome  due to phil vale.
Hard to find friendly help these days and these guys excited perfectly- well done !
Super friendly & they always have candy!
I really like this bank it's has been by far one of the best banks that i have banked with.
They are always ready to answer my questions and help me through anything.
I mean they are opened on sundays and even holidays for a few hours!!!
Mostly come here for the drive-trough atm.
Sun american was fantastic.
I worked with tracy, suzie and mary.
They were helpful and attentive, particularly tending to my needs and questions as a  first-time home buyer.
Each responded to my calls and emails almost immediately, and everything processed ahead of schedule.
I couldn't have asked for a better mortgage experience.
Every time i go whether it be inside or the drive thru i get great service.
I have banked with several institutions before trying chase and i am glad that i did.
Yes, bank of america atm's and branches are everywhere throughout charlotte.
And typically i just hit up an atm and run right out of there.
I don't think i've used a deposit slip in 2 years.
It's clean, it's convenient, it's fine.
The nice thing that i experienced yesterday if the efficiency and friendliness of the teller staff.
He seemed like a longtime customer and i hear them chatting it up about the weather, his neighbors, etc.
These folks weren't longtime friends, it was simply a nice customer relationship.
You don't see that too often anymore.
Regardless, they handled my breaking of change with a smile and have a great day.
In my book, that's pretty solid from a bank!
Matt fixed the air conditioning in my honda pilot.
Wilhelm was going to charge me nearly twice what bison's charged me.
I appreciated the honesty!
Matt also completed the job in just a short afternoon!
I had a great experience.
We recently moved here from the midwest.
He also managed to be extremely patient with our highly demanding children.
He also followed up to make sure i didn't need anything else.
Sean has amazing customer service skills, which are lacking in many professionals today.
He was so helpful and made sure my transaction went through ok to my other accounts.
Very professional and courteous.
He remembered me from the last time i went in needing help with the same type of transactions.
I rather go to this branch than the one down the street from me.
I came here to exchange some currency for international travel.
Payment can be made in cash or debit.
There is no service fee on returns.
First my state farm rep in california sent me a birthday card every year.
I always thought insurance was stale and unpleasant.
However i adopted jim "happy" mullen by marriage and what a treat it has been!
It was like he was advising friends, not clients.
I don't know how many clients they have, but they sure treat us like they have like 10.
It was a whole different operation than the other folks i had been with.
Plus their office space is super cool and convenient to uptown  :)
Just switched my business account here from desert schools and couldn't be happier!!!
Money from check deposits are available within 1-2 days,  the service has been super fast and super friendly.
I will refer anyone to this bank!
Jeremy and his team were amazing with both a refinance and new loan.
They are thorough, extremely diligent, and honest with the entire process.
I feel good about recommending jeremy and his team,
Busy on normal payday rush hours.
Lynn and here team are simply the best.
I have worked with many banks across many states and this chase location is head and shoulders above the rest.
They greet me by name, know my staff, and always welcome us with a smile.
If anyone in business, or is thinking about starting one, go and see lisa at once.
She will guide you though every step with an ungrudging smile on here face.
It truly feels as if they want you to succeed financially, can you say that about you bank?
If i felt it was local branch issue i would give lower rating.
Please do keep branch office open as without this local branch i would not bank with boa.
The virtual wallet is really good for the consumer.
It helps when you are trying to manage your money.
This bank while making a profit at least will give you tools to help you manage from your perspective.
You will not be disappointed.
Additionally, i can use my atm card anywhere without incurring fees.
The whole process was so smooth.
Jeremy schachter was so helpful during the entire mortgage process.
The entire team that  i worked with, jeremy, tyler and sharon were so helpful and knowledgeable.
Zac, tyler and the team are phenomenal!
Zac is so knowledgeable and responsive he made the arduous process of buying a home so much better.
Switched from wells fargo and couldn't feel better about the move.
Opened our account and mainly deal with the eastern branch in henderson.
They've been attentive and courteous since the beginning.
It really is nice that you don't have to worry about being taken advantage of with hidden fees, etc.
The mobile app isn't as slick as wells, but it does the job.
Supporting a credit union versus a big greedy and unethical bank feels really really good!
First, let me say that banking and trading through charles schwab has always been an amazing experience for me.
Let me list just a few highlights about what makes them so great.
Second, their free (entry level) suite of investment tools is very helpful and powerful.
Third, i can deposit checks using my smart phone.
Plus, their smart phone app is really easy to use and has a ton of other great features.
By bs fees i mean things like maintenance fees or minimum balance fees.
Plus, when setting up your account they send you a bunch of free checks.
For this location in particular (24th and lincoln) it gets 5 stars for several reasons.
First, it is easy to see and access from the road.
Anytime i've been to this branch it has seemed well staffed, clean, and nicely furnished.
Since there isn't a ton of business, there are always plenty of great parking spots.
Bottomline: good company, nice location, always easy to do business there
They have some nice bankers here, currently helpful are michelle and gregory.
They have refunded 2 overdraft transactions that occured because of duplicate charges.
They know how to keep customers rolling through and they do it with a smile.
Also i appreciate their international wire service inside.
They are more knowledgable than some of the other branches on this subject.
Whenever i have gone to the westinghouse branch, it takes an hour to do a wire.
This branch knows what they are doing and gets it done in less than half the time.
The manager of this bank is so helpful and had just moved here from calf!
About time some nice people with respect in las vegas!
I've been a customer for 22 years now.
I would say when it comes to insurance duvel is as good as it gets.
He is honest and extremely helpful in all areas.
I have never walked out of the office without feeling confident in my insurance plan.
There were two people in line in front of me.
The girl (there was only one wicket open) working behind the plexiglass patrician was efficient and very fast.
Place was easy to find and i was in/out very quickly.
Great rates to boot !
Love these guys, wonderful, customer service, low rates, reasonable fees.
I see no reason to keep using large, thieving corporate banks when awesome little credit unions like this exist.
Great benefits and customer service.
Every aspect of working with them is a plus.
I cannot think of any negatives at all, really.
They also have a free coin sorter, extended hours cold drinks, lollipops and cookies for my dogs!
Remember when you liked your bank??
Both scottsdale locations are great, but if tara at greenway & 64th ever leaves, i will cry.
But i won't leave midfirst.
I just renewed my mortgage for a second 5-year term with merix.
I'm honestly very pleased with them.
I pay on time bi-weekly and they never harass me or try to sell me other products.
I have a clean credit score and i did not have any co-signer on my mortgage.
Actually, when i first applied for my mortgage, td and merix were giving the same lowest rate.
I should add that the big banks really don't care that much about loyalty, as someone tried to say below.
Great customer service all around; i'll keep sticking with them if they keep giving me great rates such as this.
I have used this credit union for at least a decade and the service has always been consistently good.
Was in today to get a document notarized and they got it done in a jiffy.
Cheers to many more.
The absolute best branch i have ever patronized in over 10 years with wells fargo.
I recently sold my family home in california and relocated to las vegas.
Ilse luna has been a guardian angel assisting me in identifying the 25+ fraudulent transactions and clearing them up .
Rodolfo acosta has been phenomenal assisting me in setting up my investment and brokerage accounts and an unrestricted checking account.
This branch has accomplished results for me they wouldn't even look into at the executive branch.
The other employees here are all equally welcoming and ready to assist.
The best banking service i've ever had!
I cannot recommend this branch enough!
Aide and emy were very nice today!
Aide helped me tuesday this week and was also very helpful then as well!
I really appreciate her help and follow up!
Lauren on the other hand was not professional at all!
Lauren responded annoyed asking "why?"
Emy repeated her question and lauren this time responded with "what time is it?!"
Emy approached the subject again and lauren responded with "why!
Emy then explained i was waiting to see her, lauren then turned to me and exclaimed "what's up?!?"
Emy and aide quickly recovered the encounter for lauren.
Went in today to meet an individual who banks with them to get an auto loan for my vehicle.
Staff seemed to be pretty nice and courteous and got it done in a reasonable amount of time.
They exceeded my expectations with professionalism & in record time!
Thanks for everything pinnacle capital mortgage!
Now this is how a bank should do customer service.
Everyone is nice and goes out of their way to be helpful.
It's always pleasant coming in here!
Came here for the same reason most people do: to do money things.
It was pretty early, around 11 on valentine's day, and there wasn't even a hint of a line.
I was seen immediately by one of the attendants and she was extremely friendly and helpful.
On my way out, the manager even held the door open for me.
Honestly, i'm pretty happy with my visit here, even if it was to make a quick deposit.
Jeremy and his team are amazing.
Their knowledge, expertise and professionalism is outstanding.
Jeremy is a very efficient and timely communicator.
I highly recommend pinnacle capital mortgage and will surely use them in the future.
The lollipops they give at the front counter are really good!
Ask for the grape flavored one!
I think it comes in a violet colored wrapper!
If theyre out of grape then choose the strawberry one....very yummy too !!
I've been with bofa for nearly 10yrs.
They also provide my fico score updated monthly.
I own my home outright.
Car paid for but getting old.
I make a respectable salary that's directly deposited into checking acct.
Like clockwork for years.
Applied for a car loan.
Asked to have my cc limit raised (a whole $400 bucks) so i keep my utilization down.
I randomly walk into an nfcu after bofa treating me like a clean cut transient and boom!
Was your father in the military?
Please deposit $5 to become a member and open up a savings.
Ok. you'd like an auto loan.?
Interest rate is 3.79% and you can borrow up to 24k.
I opened a checking acct too and will be transferring my business to nfcu.
Bofa charges $3bucks unless you do bill pay and wait 5 biz days while your $ floats in the air.
Ariel's office is always willing to help, always finding the discounts that i need.
Never had a problem with my agent.
On a whim, my husband & i went to navy federal & i was blown away in a good way!
I have never had such amazingly efficient, fast, thorough, & professional customer service ever.
Our representative, azariah (aka benjamin), was just awesome.
Azariah is the model representative of navy federal & i truly believe he deserves a raise and recognition.
I will be recommending this bank to every veteran & vet family member i know.
I have had the opportunity of being well taken care of by navy federal.
It's been over a year since i began banking with them, then there after financing my vehicle through them.
The folks that work at the branch i commonly go to are always helpful and pleasant.
Looking forward to continuing to get great service from navy federal.
Well things have gotten much better.
I have come to like the employees and have had no issues with my account.
Teller at the drive up window was great!
Friendly and quick service.
Didn't ask me stupid questions or make me jump through hoops to cash a check and withdraw money.
Lately wells fargos have been slipping in their customer service department but not this one!
I recently set up a youth account for my 15 year old son.
I funded his new checking and savings account with about $50 each.
I believe truwest contributed too.
As his father, i'm excited to see how he handles his very own finances!
Thanks truwest for getting him started so early.
- quick and easy -   talked with a real rep moments after sending a request for a renters insurance quote.
I received my insurance policy 5 min after getting off the phone.
And it was only $1 more a month then the erenterplan insurance that was recommended by the apartment.
(who also placed me on a 10 min hold x_x)
Walked in and was politely greeted.
Savannah helped me open some accounts and was very knowledgeable.
They also have the best rates i've seen.
Truwest has been pretty good to me i must say!
I always get treated so well and all of their employees are so pleasant to work with.
I give truwest five stars for great customer service and ease of use with all of their services!
The best customer service experience i have ever had with a financial institution.
Unlike other financial institutions, merix financial took the time to listen to me.
They treated me like an actual customer and not just another number.
My mortgage will stay with merix financial, indefinitely.
This is a great credit union!
The staff is always very nice!!
It's local and more accountable to members, so there are less obnoxious fees ect.
So the best customer service ever!
Just went there to make a deposit, little did i know the account i have cost me $3.
Every time i pay a bill.
Wow they set up the account and are mailing me the paperwork needed and bank cards.
They refuneded me all the last 3.00 charges totaling 3 of them and also another charge.
I cant believe there are such good people like them around anymore.
Everyone in the place was so awesome.
I told them glad i didnt use the machine!
Also one of the bankers that assisted me gave me his card, his name is duncan lang.
Way to go wells fargo this is the best team of employees i have ever encountered.
You may want to have other employees learn from this team.
Just cant say enough!!
Jeremy and his team were awesome to work with while purchasing our first home.
They were very helpful throughout the process and kept us informed about each step.
The little videos they made about each part of the mortgage lending process were pretty funny and really informative.
This branch has a roomy parking lot and is easy to get to.
Our receipt did not have the address of the bank.
Opened a new account - very friendly and communicative!
Looking forward to our new relationship
These stars go straight to the teller by the name of hoi.
I'm not a big fan of this branch i feel as if they can be a bit disorganized.
She was really sweet!
I have purchased several cars and financed them through azstcu, and have been a member for over 20 years.
The service is excellent, the people are friendly, and they offer great loan rates to their customers.
Yes, there are fewer branches than i would like, but the personal, inexpensive service is well worth the travel!
Jeremy at pinnacle is amazing!!!
He made my first time home buying experience the best it could possibly be!!!
I had to do some business here and came to this location because it was near my title company.
It was clean, quiet, and the staff was very friendly and helpful.
One of the guys was even a little bit funny and cute too *wink wink if you're reading this*.
But the location is horrible.
Try hitting the bank at 8 am or 4pm here and it's just horrible.
I really love the bank, the workers, etc.
But the location is the worst considering all the other options around they could have picked.
Let me remind everyone my experience is only based on banking, not on loans of any sort.
Otherwise i've been pretty happy with them.
She was a pleasure and good at her job!
Jeremy took very good care of us with the purchase of our new home.
The process was very simple, and he was able to obtain a really good rate on our mortgage.
Very proud to have such a great friend and consultant!
Best and i mean best customer service i've received since having been a member of boa.
This is my second time meeting with brian wolfe.
Our first meeting was pleasant and informative, but i had to set an appointment to discuss my business accounts.
He went above and beyond the call of banking duty and got everything taken care of.
He is professional, warm and personalizes his service.
Thanks to him, my problems a are solved and i have a plan moving forward with my business.
I would refer anyone to him.
I am now an even bigger fan of bank of america.
Great drive up window.
Always friendly and rarely long lines.
I once needed a credit line and the staff was very helpful.
Great service, best banking experience ever!!!
I highly recommend navy federal to anyone that appreciates fast in and outs, and polite and courteous service..
Sean overlock is a fantastic state farm agent and an even better person.
He and his staff are super knowledgeable about the best policies for you and your family.
Highly recommend for anyone looking to switch to state farm!
Highly recommend jeremy at pinnacle!
Before moving to phoenix we found jeremy via yelp and are fortunate we did.
He is incredibly knowledgable, professional, and helpful and we'll definitely use him again if/when we have mortgage needs.
He also suggested a realtor to us who also turned out to be a 5 star professional.
I was in toronto on business and needed a quick place to change usd into cad.
This place was really good.
Much better than using a bank or changing money at the airport.
I want everyone to know what great service i receive from this branch.
His staff is well educated, knows their business, and friendly.
The branch is clean and organized and handy to smiths shopping.
I belong to 3 different banks in town but us bank is #1.
Ask bryan  about a veterans account when you stop in.
Thanks again vietnam veteran dennis
Had to come into a branch because customer service f'd a lot up over the phone.
They were beyond great in here.
My teller, melissa & then my p.b.
Always really slow in the early afternoon.
Great teller service :)
This branch is nicely located-- just east of the strip on flamingo.
There's a drive up atm.
The best thing about it is it doesn't ever seem to be busy.
Also, the tellers are always super friendly.
When i went in today, all three ladies were just sitting there.
So far my experiences with us bank has been  amazing.
My husband and i have banked here for over four years and have never had any issues.
They're quick, efficient and the customer service is fantastic.
Tiffany has gotten to know us and our family.
Asking about our little girl always rings a smile to our face.
She takes the time to get upfront whatever she's doing and come over and say hello.
She made another account and put temporary money in it  to save the day.
These available funds helped us to not occur late charges on our bills.
She was a true super hero that day.. go tiffany!!
We plan on in a couple months getting our home loan through them too
Andy is incredibly friendly and knowledgeable.
Thank you so much to stacey davis-evans and cathy hansen for the outstanding customer service.
Jeremy schachter at pinnacle capital mortgage was the best!
He made the whole process so easy and painless.
He was extremely knowledgable and patient with all of my questions.
I would highly recommend jeremy to anyone looking to buy or refinance a home.
The food was pretty good but nothing too special, but you can't expect too much from a chain restaurant.
The staff was super friendly though!
This location is awesome best branch ive ever been to.
Probably the best bank to.
I was able to get two accounts started and get two credit cards.
Im going to try and get my home loan through them to well see how that goes!
I have been banking with wells fargo for two years now and i have always had excellent customer service.
I was extremely happy to find so many wells fargo banks here in arizona after moving here recently from oregon.
I wish more businesses were like this.
It really gives you a sense of community.
They also allow dogs inside which is a huge bonus for me!
I can see myself banking with heartland for a long time.
They deserve a rave review!
They also support local events with their heartland music series which i think is incredible!
I'm a huge music lover so seeing a local business support something so important is really wonderful.
We had a great experience working with pinnacle capital mortgage.
Definitely recommend their services.
Great place for currency exchange.
Just needed to change usd$200 into canadian to be a tourist.
They quoted the same exchange rate google was showing me, and simply charged a flat 3.50 fee.
No other fees or %'s.
Friendly person behind the counter gave me whatever denominations i wanted.
Highly recommend this place.
We can and will wholeheartedly recommend pinnacle to all of our friends in the future.
Give them a chance to show you what they can do - you won't regret it!
I was blown away by this guy.
Very rarely do you meet someone with such a high level of integrity and genuine care.
Firstly, his follow up was spot on, called when he said he would and was flexible in scheduling a meeting.
Never once did i feel pressure to buy, rather he asked questions that helped me make my own decisions.
I had a ridiculous amount of questions and he took his time going over them with me and my wife.
We never felt rushed.
The bank is very large and welcoming.
Smells good and is usually clean.
The bad thing about this place is the atm is inside and usually doesn't work.
Right now it is 9:50am in the morning and i am 6 people deep in the line at the bank.
I've never been in line this long before.
I usually just stop in and out here but today is an exception.
Christopher helped me today.
He was kind enough to give me a paper to write down my large width drawl for privacy sake.
He was quick and efficient.
Couldn't have asked for anything more in my teller!
We needed to refinance under the harp2 program.
I called our bank and few others to see what they could offer, which was a joke.
I read reviews on zillow, yelp, google and bbb before choosing pinnacle capital.
Zac white and jeremy schachter are just super guys to work with.
They provided credible, helpful information the very same day i sent them an inquiry.
They figured it all out really quickly and got us a great rate.
They're both so nice, communicative and answered all of our questions promptly and accurately.
We're extremely pleased how smoothly everything was handled.
Hopefully these guys get awards, as their level of customer service is beyond the norm.
I have stopped by twice recently to this location, and damien was so courteous and professional.
I broke both of my wrists so writing was difficult.
He had patience of a saint as i fumbled with my pen and writing.
Even joked that my signature was better than his.
I feel that he went above and beyond.
We've been customers since 1996 and have had many experiences with azfcu.
We will continue to bank here.
I can't say enought good things about this branch of america first.
I had to open a new account after experiencing a fraudulent close down of my wells fargo account.
Kelsey wight set up my new account very quickly and was so professional and personable.
This branch gets you in and out quickly even on a friday night.
You will be so glad you did!!
Jeremy at pinnacle capital mortgage helped me refinance my home in a way that was effective and honest.
He took a messy situation and made it manageable for me to handle.
I had so many questions throughout the process, and he and sharon answered each one with care.
Jeremy was easy to work with and made sure he followed through with each and every step.
I highly recommend him to anyone with mortgage needs.
I never felt so comfortable with the people who take care of my insurance.
He's also really cute
The service here is always exceptional.
No one enjoys errands or going to the bank, but here the transactions are seamless, pleasant, and without any hitches.
It seriously is such a difference from the durango location!
First time coming here and had a smooth process from start to finish.
I called the branch to make a same-day appointment with a banker.
Upon walking in, i was immediately greeted and escorted to the person i had an appointment with.
Appointment took less than 20 minutes and i was on my way.
Thanks for the professional and efficient customer service!
Now a more centralized location for us las vegans!!
Great customer service, hospitality.
Their facility is very clean, sharp, and of course brand new.
They even had someone to greet and open the doors for the customers.
And the filipina tellers were of course awesome as well.
My mom, however, has banked with them for years now and swears by them.
The people were all friendly and courteous.
They obviously know my mom and it wasn't the generic experience i was expecting.
The customer service and attention to detail was amazing.
I am now considering switching banks!
The staff here is amazing!
They are so nice and courteous!
I drive from across town sometimes just to bank at that branch...they are externally professional and make you feel welcome.
I highly recommend this bank of america location!
I've used calforex a number of times to change money before a trip.
They have always had better rates than any other exchange place or bank.
It adds up if you are exchanging a lot of money, so finding a good place is important.
Their fees are reasonable too.
$2.50 for anyting under $500 and $3.50 for anything over $500 (i think).
The only small negative i would give them is that they weren't able to get icelandic krona for me.
It was considered "rare" and "volatile" so they don't stock it, and were unwilling to order the amount i needed.
They considered the amount too small (more than $1,500 worth) to deal with.
All in all, i would definitely recommend this place for currency exchange.
She made sure to give us the best coverage and save the most money.
She has been my agent since i started driving.
Unfortunately i was one of those people who came in right before closing time.
Besides the point.... even five minutes before closing i was still greeted by someone standing in the front entrance.
I was acknowledged by assuming the shift manager that someone will be with me in a moment.
Customer service is number one for me and that they had.
She stated that  steven would be with me as soon as he was done.
When steven was free he welcomed me to his window.
Transaction was done smoothly and he took the time to ask how my day was.
Even knowing he was probably ready to be done for the day he took his time with me.
Very friendly and professional.
I have not been banking with well's fargo very long but every experience i've had has been a good one.
My transaction wasn't easy but jeremy took the reigns and provided the best and most efficient transaction.
Communication was superb and i highly recommend jeremy to any and all!!
I cannot say enough good things about jeremy & his team.
He gave me great ideas to improve my finances even before the loan process started.
Jeremy & his team were on top of everything throughout the process.
Things went quickly & efficiently.
Jeremy was always available to chat when i was stressing out.
The final perfect touch was that he made the trip to the title company to be at my closing.
I'm glad he was there too, because an issue came up that he helped to fix.
I cannot recommend jeremy enough for anyone looking to refinance or get a new mortgage for a home purchase.
Great accounts, free atms, and superb customer service!
The employees at this office are excellent.
They always take the time to look into my account and help improve my policy.
Great service and it's a beautifully renovated branch i love coming here it's never busy with no line ups.
I'm in and on to my daily tasks.
Nasira was so friendly i just opened an acct she as so sweet.
This is my new favorite bank.
The place is clean and everyone so nice
Friendly staff, they work hard and care about their customers.
They have a lot of demands placed on them, day-to-day, hour-by-hour, but they encounter each customer with a smile.
If you're lucky enough to get sarah, make sure you let her know how great of a job she's doing!
I love there customer service they always find ways to make sure you have no questions unanswered.
Got here wait in line to be next .
Then i noticed i was supposed to be next instead the old lady cut in front of me .
We talk and i explain my problem.
Anyway he look into my problem that i have he try is best to help me.
And in the end he help me solve my problem.
I have to admit this young man have consumers service experienced .
And on top he try to help solve there problem.
This bank is very lucky to have this man working for them.
I wish we can have this man in orange county.
This young man tommy dixson really care for his consumers.
And he will go out his way to help any consumers that need help.
I was very lucky to have him help with my problem.
I just wish there more of mr dixson .
It was nice meeting mr dixson god bless you.
Very nice young man.
I just wish other branch can learn from this young dixson.
I like to thanks mr dixson for helping me .
God bless you .
And they won't regret coming here.
We have used jeremy @ pinnacle capital for two mortgages and one refinance.
He and his team are always very organized, responsive and make the process as easy as possible.
He is always our go to guy and offers competitive rates and the best customer service around!
All the operations where done online, very convenient.
Therefore by switching i make more money, and keep more money.
I definitely recommend this bank!
Great service by torrie hinds, consumer banker!
Went above and beyond and stayed late to get our business account open!
I love this chase branch.
I consistently receive excellent customer service.
I had a horrible experience at the branch on shea and tatum.
This branch rectified the situation and apologized for his unprofessional behavior.
This is a 5- star branch!
Professional, knowledgeable and friendly customer service.
Ann has solved my urgen issue in less then a minute, all with smile and positive attitude.
At the end of the day, a bank is a bank.
The only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because it took forever to open an account.
Not because we had to wait for service but because the lady doing it was super slow.
Nonetheless every time i go in, i am greeted with a smile.
Definitely like the new look of chase.
Not the biggest fan of the bank or any bank but where else are you going to put your money.
We were so frustrated with the process of trying to modify our loan.
We bought our home and closed the week that the housing market crashed.
We tried working with the banks to modify but were pushed into endless circles chasing paperwork for over a year.
During the process jeremy would call at least weekly to give a status update and expectations for the next steps.
We now have a conventional mortgage at a much lower rate saving us over $600/month.
We really appreciate an honest and caring business in the community.
Pinnacle made us feel like we were the only clients.
It was a really great experience.
We have been doing business with jeremy for many years and many homes.
The peace of mind we get from his outstanding service and follow through is second-to-none.
Good local service and better rates that the online-only companies.
We started with another lender that we have worked with, and been happy with, for a number of years.
However, we decided to do a bit more research for this loan and came across pinnacle capital.
What we found was that all turned out to be true and then some.
Jeremy, sharon, and marcea were incredibly responsive and helpful throughout the whole process.
Now that is customer service!
I wholeheartedly recommend them to anyone looking for a home loan or refinance.
I had a superb experience with zachary and his team at pinnacle capital mortgage.
They worked tirelessly to get me a refinance on my home.
I will absolutely revisit zachary and his team at pinnacle in the future when my situation improves.
No doubt at all.
Mortgages: everybody wants one now and nobody likes having one all at the same time.
Refi is equivalent to a root canal for most.
Yet, jeremy and his team at pinnacle capital mortgage make me wish i could refi yearly.
Process was simple, straight forward, and a breeze.
They saved me a ton of money, provided great, competitive rates, and their technology meant only one actual phone call.
Should i have needed more assistance or handholding, i'm confident they were only a phone call away.
My closing was just as easy.
I encourage you to call/message them today.
You have nothing to lose and everything to gain.
Join me, lower your monthly payment, and enjoy the ride!
The few times i've used this branch, i've been pleased with the customer service and friendly attitude of the staff.
This branch has excellent customer service.
Jesse opened a new account for me and was very helpful and friendly.
I highly recommend this branch if you're going to open a chase account in scottsdale.
Pinnacle capital was the best investment that we made in purchasing our home.
We researched them on bbb, and our experience was completely positive!
Zac was efficient and sharon was always friendly and helpful.
We had access to zac virtually 24 hours a day by email, cell phone, and office.
This was a remarkable personal touch.
Our loan closed a week early without a hitch.
This is the best customer service i have ever received at any banks.
I do business with 2 other banks and they can't compare with this wells fargo branch.
All of the employees are friendly and helpful.
Naturally, i always get my bottle water before i leave.
The staff at this location is great!
My wallet disappeared while i was on vacation in las vegas and they were very helpful.
The folks at chase, especially the manager (i think her name was sarah) saved my vegas vacation!!!
Thank goodness for the new instant debit card service and the wonderful helpful staff at this location!
We were unsure of the whole process and naturally a bit apprehensive.
We began to do some research and stumbled upon pinnacle capital mortgage.
None of this would be possible without the staff at pinnacle capital mortgage and there precise and extremely speedy service.
Thank you jeremy and staff!!!
At pinnacle capital mortgage you guys are amazing.
Excellent company to work with in obtaining finance for a new home, customers feel they are treated like family.
Happy they are part of the sales.processat atchafalya homes
Sean is one of the most knowledgeable and professional insurance agents in the north east valley.
Top notch customer service.
Came in on a saturday and they made me feel important as a long time chase customer.
This newly constructed building is that the swc of e. camelback rd.
And n. 7th st.
The facility's nice but the parking lot is tight.
Look all ways/directions before pulling out of your parking spot or entering street traffic from their lot.
If i could give pinnacle stars i would do so.
From start to finish, zac white and his team kept me updated constantly without my having to ask or wonder.
The whole refi process was handled professionally and smoothly.
I highly recommend zac & team at pinnacle capital mortgage whether refinancing or initial finance.
Working with pinnacle and especially jeremy s. has been a well worth it experience.
Jeremy was able to secure us a mortgage better than expected and kept us in the loop the entire time.
He was also helpful with recommending other service professionals that are as highly experienced as himself.
She was very helpful, friendly and she provided very great customer service.
I had no problems or issues changing anything and she made things very clear and simple.
Sent over the info i needed and made my life very easy compared to my last experience with state farm.
I had renter's insurance through state farm and the whole process was breeze.
I just called and spoke with karen and it seems like everyone in this office is the best!
Friendly staff, always feel welcoming in the mornings when i stop by.
I'm not much of a morning person but a quick stop never hurt.
I haven't ever used a currency exchange.
The next time i travel and require currency, i will definitely go back.
When i first moved to phoenix this bank was close to my home.
I developed a wonderful business relationship with cindy & she helped me get started.
Now, years later...i still only go to this bank if i need to "walk in".
I drive all the way across town to go to this location.
So very helpful & eager to help you achieve the financial goals you may have in store!!!
Very helpful teller and the location wasn't busy when i stopped in!
They do have a drive thru atm, yay!
Located right in front of the dmv.
We worked with zac white and what an experience it was.
The entire process went very smoothly, all questions were answered and he always got back to us extremely promptly.
E-mails returned within about an hour every single time.
Just an amazing level of service.
We'll be recommending zac and pinnacle capital to any and all of our friends who need a mortgage!
Very nice employees, although a slightly weird location.
Its located in scottsdale next to a pizza shop and a best buy in a strip mall.
I came in, they printed me checks really quickly, and called it a day.
I've been banking with chase for years...every since living in chicago...and was happy to continue my relationship out here.
I've been to many branches but really like the staff at this one.
Everyone is very friendly and helpful and they are conveniently located close to my home and where i shop.
They reversed the fees and changed my account so it wouldn't happen again in the future.
Fantastic service, inside and at the drive up teller window.
The staff is always pleasant and efficient in helping with your banking needs.
They offer 2 outside atms which is nice for busy times of the day.
I've been banking with pnc for little over ten months now and i'm impressed.
The people at this branch are more than helpful and really make everyday interactions personable and enjoyable.
Joyce is an absolute star - if you can clone her do it!
:-) they will have trouble getting rid of this client...
This location is clean and organized.
Staff is friendly and helpful.
Also, the atm is broken regularly enough that i'm never surprised if the atm is not working.
As far as i know, there isn't a drive thru atm for this location.
Still, this boa is very professional and i will continue to come.
A place where they've figured out a way to actually live their "banking can be this comfortable" slogan.
The biggest difference you might notice, there are zero tellers.
That's right, no lining up to deposit your cheques, take out small bills, international currency exchange.
Want $20 in $5 bill increments?
How about when you use the regular atm?
They are also home to one of the only vaults with absolutely no cash money in.
So why have it?
So you can rent a safety deposit box, the whole thing is filled with them.
Now for the most impressive feature in my opinion, their layout.
Couches and lounge chairs everywhere, free wifi and mobile phone charging stations.
The reason for this?
Overall a very comfortable and innovative banking experience and mississauga is very lucky to have the first of its kind.
Banking is now more comfortable than ever!
She helped and explained everything with me being new to bank accounts.
I'm happy with the choice of bank i went with
Let me start by stating a plain and simple fact, "i hate walking into banks."
Honestly though, this is the one branch that really, really works hard at making you a satisfied banking customer.
The manager greeted me by opening the door and also wished me a happy day upon leaving.
The bottom line, if you have to go inside a bank, i recommend this branch.
I have been doing business with the stephanie branch for four years.
I look for services at a good price.
The cheerfulness of the tellers isn't important to me.
If they impede my doing business with them, then i would be concerned but that hasn't ever happened here.
I have a safe deposit box which is bigger and cheaper than the local banks.
I have a car loan that is more competitively priced than the local banks.
I take my loose change in and use their change machine (free for customers) and really appreciate that service.
I am very happy with the credit union.
My one complaint is there website/internet banking.
Definitely outdated and in need of a total upgrade.
Maximum transfers are too low and system itself is very slow.
I maintain only a small checking account here and use others for my main checking.
If i didn't, i would be very frustrated.
I opened my accounts at midfirst in 2008 and have been a super happy camper with this bank.
Customer service is phenomenal!
They always remember your name.
They have awesome banking hours.
My atm w/d fees get reimbursed if i used another bank's atm.
The bank's lobby has a lovely welcoming ambiance.
The list goes on - highly recommend!
I have only gone inside a couple times, but wow on the customer service!
Everything is stellar, especially at this location.
I recently switched from another major insurance carrier to state farm because of sean overlock's outstanding team.
Sean overlock's team provides all three exceptionally well.
Thank you so much to sandra gomez and the rest of sean's team.
Keep doing all that you do!
These guys made buying my first home a breeze!
Thank you jeremy and your team for your great and speedy work!!
I was greeted at the door by an extremely nice manager and escorted to a very friendly and knowledgeable teller!!!
Then i was escorted to the door and i told the manager that my service was definitely a 10!!!
I highly recommend the lawrenceville citizens bank location on butler and main st.
I read other reviews where other people have complained but i had a very good experience.
I'm by no means rich but i've never had an overdraft so i can't comment about the fees they charge.
I only come in here once a month to deposit a rent check.
Every single time i go in, they welcome me with a warm greeting and ask how i'm doing.
The tellers are quick and friendly.
I've always been given the best customer service there.
I decided to try panda express at the mall this time over the other fast food chinese places.
They also cooked the vegetables up fresh for you.
The flavor was really good for the price and i thought the portion was just right.
I was able to have a fulfilling meal and take some home for later.
I liked the teriyaki sauce on the side too so you can regulate how much you want on your food.
Jeremy's whole team is extremely efficient, very communicative, and above all follow through on everything.
But never too late!
Rest assured, this is a business with integrity and deserves all the great reviews it gets.
Zac and his crew at pcm took care of my mortgage.
Very professional and caring.
They held my hand thru the entire process and found the best mortgage for me.
So much gratitude to this exceptional team.
Jeremy, sharon and the pinnacle capital mortgage team are as solid as they come.
I have purchased and refinanced many times over the years using every type of lender, broker, banker etc.
I discovered pinnacle and jeremy through an online search as i am purchasing in az from out of state.
I needed someone who would be responsive, professional and trustworthy.
He was very well reviewed but would my experience live up to the experience of others?
Oh and he and everyone in his office i worked with are nice.
There was a last minute issue which came up in that my wire transfer didn't match the final closing statements.
I hope to work with jeremy again myself.
Needed a loan to help bridge my daughters medical expenses for one month.
I hate going to banks or inquiring about this stuff.
Ceaser (store manager) kept the process light, was funny, empathetic, & helpful.
We were in and out in 30 minutes with exactly what we had asked for.
It was a nice alternative for short-term loans.
( i should add that i physically went to at least 3 other title loan places and walked away.)
I've had a checkered history with banks, especially those with false information!
My bank told me they had euros on site, went to the bank, they had nothing!
Not even a single dollar.
I walked in hours later, and was literally in and out within a minute...no i.d.
No signature, no fuss no hassle no problem!
I was extremely happy and impressed with this quick and easy service and i wish more places were like this.
No day or two wait time!
So i walk into this bank and everyone was very friendly.
Jesse came over and said he would help me.
I sat at his desk and he was more than helpful !!!
Everything i asked he knew.
I will never go to another wells fargo thank you so much jesse
I have recommended jeremy with pinnacle morgage to all my friends.
He answers the phone.
He is almost immediate with his responses.
We have used him multiple times.
His staff is amazing too.
My husband and i found a house we wanted to buy on a whim.
It was like 12:00pm.
And by 4p we had been prequalified and our offer was submitted.
He worked seamlessly with our realtor.
If it wasn't for him, i would not have the house i fell in love with.
There were 5 offers and he made it happen.
He is smart and honest and a great guy.
Great place to work!!!
Environment is so welcoming and open...unlike any other place i've ever worked at!
I have banked with chase for years and have always had great service.
I love their "choose your own bills" atms and the fact they are everywhere.
Today we came in to open a new business account, a rather long process, anita vega was our banker.
She was kind and welcoming and super professional.
Everything was explained in detail and anita made the process painless.
Great job chase for maintaining customer loyalty where there are so many banking choices.
I would like to thank zac white for doing such a good job.
I was working with another mortgage broker who could not give me any choices as far as rates were concerned.
I called pinnacle and spoke to zac.
He was very knowledgeable and gave me many choices.
To top it off, i got money back to apply towards my closing costs.
They have candy and water and it's cool.
The service at this location is often slow but always friendly.
I am always greeted as i enter the bank.
They always ask if there's anything else i need.
I recommend this branch as long as you aren't in a hurry!
Its not just about the company but also the agent.
Wes stahler's office has been a great experience.
They are responsive and want to understand your needs to ensure you are accurately covered.
They even talked to me about products to ensue that i am covered in the future.
I not only recommend state farm but specifically i recommend wes stahler's office.
Great business to support.
Received excellent care for a periodic visit for audiology and repair of hearing aids.
Quick appointment, text reminders and confirmation and efficient self check in.
Was early and was seen early.
Had a long drive and anticipated some glitches but none occurred.
Very professional and courteous with each staff contact.
Don't feel entitled but found respect for my service and made me feel good about bing a vet.
I use this branch weekly my business is right down the street so it's super convenient.
As soon as you walk in all the employees welcome you or say hello.
Down home friendly banking in a big city is hard to find.
I've always been very pleased!
The place is a little worn though.
Great customer service most of the bankers are bilingual even though that doesn't apply to me.
The parking lot is u-shaped which is nice, you pull in one way and go out the other, very simple.
They always greet me at the door and ask if i want a water.
Very helpful and friendly!
I really am amazed at the level of customer service.
I'm usually in and out quickly.
I stop in here for all my baking needs.
Ben, the branch manager is super nice, and the rest of the staff is always nice and friendly.
Jeremy was extremely helpful and know his stuff in looking at an opportunity to refinance our home.
Everyone in phoenix should give him an opportunity to save themselves money on their mortgages.
Best chase bank in town.
If u want $17, $56, $763 ect.
It lets you choose what bills u want  1, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 dollar bills.
Pretty cool to me.
Now i don't have to be stuck with a bunch of $20 bills
I've been a proud member of navy federal credit union for over ten years now.
I already had a number of bank accounts, but my brother encouraged me to open an account.
(he was enlisted at the time.)
At the time i lived in san diego so it made more sense to have a local account.
Living here in phoenix i have less of a need to visit my branch.
But when i do, i positively *love* it!
Plus they always have cookies.
Navy federal (overall) is wonderful.
Any branch i've ever walked into has been the same.
You really can't go wrong with banking with navy fed.
I ring navy federal, they pick up the phone.
No matter whom i speak to, any issue i've had has been resolved.
Great online user experience.
The exact opposite of dealing with the global banks i've previously been associated with.
I [heart] navy federal credit union.
I was also glad that they opened a more central location.
Having to trek north or south for a 45 minute drive was such an obstacle for me.
Everybody was wonderful and helpful, no problems.
Clean well lit atm's and plenty of parking that's close by to prevent and scary issues.
The inside of this location is quiet and we'll organized...not much else to say, it's a bank folks.
Love to go to this location when i have my kids w/ me.
=) the person who helped my husband & i open an account for the 1st time moved to this location.
(sorry... i'm drawing a blank on his name right now).
Best of all, he remembers us by name!
That's great customer service if you ask me.
Overall, great customer service if you do a walk-in as well as the drive-thru.
Great service- don't go during peak hours.
Lafotasi is helpful, en pointe, and a rarity in customer service.
Don't let your best employees walk without added responsibility and trust!
Lucy, neira, and tracy are very helpful and welcoming.
The process is very straightforward and they are very comforting.
They will direct you through the entire way!
The home buying experience i had with jeremy and everyone at pinnacle capital mortgage was smooth and seamless.
The team at pinnacle capital mortgage treat you like a long-time friend, not as customer or a number.
Throughout the buying process, you are well-informed every step of the way.
Should a question arise, they are immediately there to assist.
I highly recommend pcm to friends and family.
Thank you for making it easy!
I look forward to working with you all in the future.
I don't deal with people if i don't have to.
This place has walk-up atm's, and that's as far as i go here.
Quick review: o love this branch in particular.
I've gone to others and this one has that home grown feel.
We used pcm to refinance our mortgage and i couldn't have asked for a better experience.
Everyone was so friendly and timely on responses.
The process went so smoothly!!
I have to give kuddos to zac, rhonda & sharon for an amazing job!
Jeremy and the team at pinnacle made my first-time home buying experience easy to understand, manageable, and friendly.
What's most important is i trust their work and guidance - an important factor when making such a big commitment.
Hands down, i'll be back to pinnacle for future mortgage needs.
Helpful bunch, but they're limited in how they can help on location.
Been with sce for about 6 months now.
Signed up after them coming out to my work offering better rates on loans and better service.
At that time, i met manager, ludi.
Now i won't lie and say it's been perfect.
There have been a couple of goofs on sces part that annoyed me.
I can't think of anywhere else i've been treated like this, certainly not a bank.
Ludi and sce have earned a difficult, but very happy customer!
Always asking if they can help you with anything else.
Parking is always available and drive thru lanes go fast.
I haven't done anything here except for cash deposits and withdrawals.
As far as that goes, i've never had a bad experience.
This branch is small, clean, and has a drive up atm.
5 stars for all my basic banking needs!
Words cannot begin to describe just how thrilled i am right now.
I had the pleasure of working with jeremy and his team and they helped me refinance my home.
First of all, the man has more patience than anyone i know.
He stayed on top of everything and kept me updated on every detail regarding refinancing my home.
He will make sure you are well taken care of and get you the best possible rate.
Thank you again jeremy for everything!
Dave and kathy did a wonderful job helping us find the right loan that fit our needs.
Overall it was an excellent experience.
Cheryll and denise are super efficient and thorough.
I came here to get some work done quickly.
They didn't give me any hassle when i did it and there was no line while getting it done.
They didn't complain while the other members of our party waited around either.
There are too many names to mention when offering praise to these men and women.
Yesterday carlos helped update my profile.
He is a true asset to wells fargo.
Wells fargo hires the nicest people.
You have a great team - let's keep them happy - pay raises for everyone!
I would highly recommend this company.
This company took a chance with us and we were very grateful!!
We knew from the foreclosure not to have a arm loan that makes payments over 3 years higher and higher.
We were much smarter and knew what we could afford and not $1,400 a month like before the housing crisis.
Thank god for zac who got us into the house we live in today.
He also did a refinance for us when no other company would as well.
We pay less for this house now than would if rented.
If you are debating if you should try out this company definitely do not hesitate and give them a try!!!
They keep you informed every step of the way!
I love coming into the office.
The professionalism is stellar and very easy to work with.
All questions are answered within minutes, and make it worth calling.
Thank you ariel for always being there.
My wife and i began looking for mortgage companies starting in february contacting several and barely hearing anything back.
I found zac white here on yelp and figured there's nothing to lose and sent a message over.
Minutes later he called me back and discussed nearly every option available.
He also put us in touch with a realtor he works closely with which made the entire experience seamless.
With tom harman - state farm insurance, i would save well over $200 a year with the exact same coverage.
Tom even called and sang me happy birthday, how cool is that?!
Email, paperwork and payments have all been very easy.
Zac white is amazing!
He was so helpful and essential in our home purchase.
He is a work-a-holic who went out of his way to ensure our loan was approved and processed timely.
Zac was very accommodating and preapproved us over the phone in the event we found a house immediately.
I cannot say enough good things about zac's enthusiasm, professionalism, and dedication to his clients.
I would recommend zac to all my friends and family and will use his services in the future!
Parker turk and his staff are amazing!
Super honest and professional.
I highly recommend there guys.
Speedy and efficient at a good price.
We look forward to him expanding his shop.
So believe the reviews and the hype guys and do use jeremy and his team for anything mortgage related.
Went to this bank and had excellent service.
Lindsay helped us open an account and was very honest about everything.
We also got $125 for opening one.
The card for the account was ready that day.
I felt very fortunate to go to a bank that was helpful and knew all their clients who walked in.
Greatest bank in arizona.
It's privately owned and operated.
Great bank and great employees, this is what banking is all about.
They even open on sundays too, can't beat that.
Being self-employed, it's always stressful getting all of my ducks in a row when buying/selling homes.
I started working on the loan process with jeremy at pinnacle capital almost a year in advance.
Everything was organized and in place when i found my home and the loan process was seamless.
I also love supporting other locally-owned businesses in central phoenix who live up to their reputation.
At any other bank when you make a cash deposit your cash is available instantly.
Everyone here is incredibly friendly.
Thanks for being awesome, guys!
I was contacted just minutes after leaving my negative review here on yelp!
Great job management of altier cu!
I have been with midfirst bank for over two years now and love them.
Their customer service is the best around - bar none.
I am getting 2% on my checking account balance and i don't have to have a huge balance in it.
No atm fees, sunday hours, extended weekly hours, beautiful, well designed, elegant bank facilities!
What's not to like!
They are not a publicly traded bank that is beholding to stockholders and wall streets quarterly whims.
Sce is a very wonderful bank i highly suggest getting this bank, great friendly staffs and an satisfied costumer service.
Me and my girlfriend has shared branching from hawaii and they make it easier for us to pay.
Both locations do a very good job!
Other than that the customer service is good and bank is very neat and clean.
I'm not a huge fan of the bell they would like you to ring if you received great service.
Sorry, i will never ring it.
I think because they farm that work out.
I imagined it was something like the way you used to return movies at blockbuster, but it's not.
I also wonder why they ever put holds on cheques.
So, i'll give five stars to this bank location, and 2 or 3 stars to "banking" as a general concept.
Jeremy and team were awesome.
Every step of the way they took care of everything.
Kept us up to date and responded to every question quickly.
The videos are amazing!!
We all know how hard it is to find a trustworthy and good mechanic let alone a great one.
Thanks to yelp i found bison automotive.
Jeremy and his team worked so hard to get our refi done quick efficiently.
There is a couple of atm's on the side.
I used it about half the time.
I went inside for the other half of the visits here.
I didn't have any problems here, though generally, it was always during the day.
Beats driving down to n. las vegas or henderson.
A much greater branch location that lives in the southwest region of las vegas.
Thanks navy fed for thinking of us!
Jeremy is the "go-to-guy" for a mortgage!
He has done two for me now and i would never even call anyone else.
His operation is excellent, friendly and he actually delivers.
Top notch service all the way!
Managers everywhere asking you ten million questions.
I know how to stand in line, i do not need assistance.
I came here after checking out bendix & guardian, they both offered worser rates.
At least at calforex the lady behind the counter is friendly too, with respectable fees.
Jeremy schachter recently helped our family as our mortgage advisor.
He did a wonderful job of expediting our loan and explaining each step along the way.
He is thorough, accessible, professional and very caring.
We greatly appreciate his help during our home buying process
So, i guess, vbce may forget about me, i go to calforex for all my currencies purchases now.
We have been using wells fargo for business for years... we make transactions almost everyday at the drive through.
They have exceptional customer service and we appreciate that very much.
Teller was super efficient and pretty friendly.
That branch is usually good about getting the people in and out.
Very important when you are trying to live your life.
Cash dem checks baby!
Carmen did a great job assisting me today and was very pleasant.
I enjoy coming to this location.
This is one of the branches we frequent the most, and have consistently had good service.
Also, on a recent trip i saw a lady customer mistreat a young employee.
And i apologized to her in behalf of all of us decent human beings.
I think we all are allowed to have a bad day here and there, but nothing justifies such rudeness.
My wife and i have home, auto, and life with wes.
He also gave us his home and cell phone number if we had any questions.
Everyone at this state farm agency is happy.
Mr. mullen came out and introduced himself and i was really impressed with him and his team.
Lisa was great on transferring my policies from california to nc and explained everything very well.
It's a great idea to have a good insurance resource...happy mullen is it for me.
I don't bank here, but i'm strongly considering changing my accounts to wells fargo at this location.
I've been having a heck of time cashing a treasury savings bond, my credit union didn't do it.
I came here and i got good vibes, the teller angel was pleasant, easy to talk to.
I looked around at the other tellers and they were young, cordial and had great attitudes.
Even though it was almost closing time.
I'm going to look into banking here.
Zac has made this process extremely smooth and has been really attentive.
I would highly recommend pinnacle capital and zac to anyone!
Literally, we sat back and they took care of everything.
They worked extremely hard to close our loan early per our request and i can't thank them enough!
I'm on my way to pick up the keys to my first home thanks to these guys.
I can't recommend them enough!
The bank is good for deposits and withdrawals.
The parking lot is a madhouse, every time you go you risk an accident...no fail, every time.
They are quick about ordering foreign currency.
I mostly just use the atm out front
I've had insurance with tom harman's state farm office since moving to charlotte almost 9 years ago.
He has a wonderful friendly professional staff that is attentive to taking care of his clients.
They are very knowledgeable and provide quick responses to my inquiries.
I highly recommend using his office for your insurance needs.
These people are awesome!!!!
They always remember me when i come in and they go above and beyond to make sure you are satisfied!
I was amazed how accommodating they are!!
I love wells fargo bank!
I was a bank of america customer and finally decided to leave them i was never satisfied with them.
Wells fargo customer service is amazing specially this location.
This new branch is nice and accessible, the customer service and the staffs are awesome especially jordan.
This branch was so clean and nice.
Cannot say how much i appreciated all this information and assistance.
I've been banking with this pnc branch (formerly national city) since 2006.
The staff here are amazing - they really make the whole banking experience seamless and easy whenever possible.
Floors look spit shined.
Care on both visits have been exceptional and i would heartily recommend going here
We had a great experience working with zac as we purchased our first home.
He was quick to answer all questions, offered great advice and genuinely cared about helping us through the whole process.
You will definitely have a stress-free experience working with him.
I 100% recommend them, especially zac!
He is without a doubt the most trusted, knowledgeable, and professional loan officer to work with.
He is also a genuinely caring person who truly wants what's best for his clients.
If you are looking to buy a home, do yourself a favor and enlist jeremy's assistance.
It will be your "best move for your move"!
I can't say enough about the level of service i received from zach, tyler and sharon.
From the start everything is as laid out and explained to me.
Zach made sure not only to answer my questions but also made sure i was confident with my decisions.
He provided various options to see what worked best for me.
Each step in the process was seamless and not once did i feel like i was being pawned off.
They are professional, courteous and thorough.
You  will be pleased
This bank does not treat you like another number.
I should have joined this credit union before as it's member services and products are on point.
Now i'm able to build my credit with their advisor.
The branch on spring mountain and rainbow is a new facility and not too busy.
I had to open a business account and i went to this bank.
Well, i have to say i was pleasantly surprised.
Looking around there was about 4 people waiting too.
I met ruppi who begin to help me with the business account.
There were the usual questions and waiting while papers were filled out and crosschecked.
Ruppi was very helpful and went beyond the norm a few times during the application process.
After about 20 minutes i was sent on my way with everything signed and ready to go.
I had the online banking and a nice new debit card in the mail.
Not bad at all.
Great experience with no hassles....they did their magic and my wife and i couldn't be happier.
Would recommend sun american mortgage in a heartbeat...thank you so much.
This bank is awesome!!!
I love their customer service!
Alethea helped me open a new account and she was super helpful, warm, and welcoming.
I felt very comfortable handling my banking at this branch and i really appreciated it!
The atmosphere is great!
I'd love to come back here and do more banking with my account!
Great customer service and great services and deals.
By far the best team i have came across.
Very satisfying and professional.
I  recommend jason's team to everyone, especially amabilia and guadalupe...very nice people, they always find ways to help you save.
The customer service at this branch is incredible!
I have been going here for years.... ricardo, the business banker is top notch, no matter what i need.
He is so respectful, attentive.
I specifically go to this branch for everything.
Angelyn is so nice.
Always smiling and in a great mood.
Just wanted to express how lovely she is.
The staff is always working hard to accommodate the needs of the customers.
Like all business,  bank branches have cut back on staffing.
The employees here took the time to teach me to utilize the technology.
The staff is extremely knowledgeable, and professional.
We have been with tom now for over 24 years.
We lived on the other side of charlotte (the side where tom is) while awaiting the completion of our home.
There are many state farm agents between our home and his office.
But i will drive the distance, when necessary, to stay with this agency.
Tom & his staff are the best.
I guess the best way to describe our relationship with him is safe.
We feel safe with tom harmon & his staff.
I got my rv loan through america first.
Notwithstanding that fact, she gave me her email address and contact number and was very accessible and very responsive.
She worked around some obstacles we had involving a private-party seller and made the entire process smooth and easy.
Well done, america first.
The customer service is awesome at this branch.
They know my name every time i come in.
Smiles on there faces and a genuine love of the customers.
If you are thirsty, never fear they will give you a water while you stand in line.
Which by the way is never long.
Decent bank (they all have their issues) and you can get free checking with direct deposit.
Lots of branch locations, too.
I've been coming here since i was 15.
Great people that really care.
Thank you for all your help.
Would definitely recommend doing my business at this location!
Ahmed the manager and the whole staff are amazing and super friendly!
Very clean and very nice.
I was able to receive assistance right away and everything went smoothly.
Everything one would expect from a banking experience.
The agents are always more than willing to help, and i have never had the slightest problem.
Always a pleasure to conduct business with happy mullen's office!
Probably the best forex place in downtown toronto.
Place is clean and nice and not sketchy looking.
I haven't actually been inside, but found the outdoor drive thru well-lit and clean.
You can tell that this location is new.
I would certainly recommend them to anyone!
Great service, greets guests, proactive, and helpful.
One of the best wellsfargo branches i have visited.
I love this bank!
They are very friendly and wait times are always good.
They also offer pretty much the same deals that any other bank offers.
All their banks are nicely appointed on the inside.
This location has soaring ceilings, nice floors, and lots of light.
It is a lot different from any other banks.
Highly recommended as i can't stand chain businesses and too big to fail banks.
Anytime i have any questions regarding my policy state farm is always there!
Everyone here is helpful and very sweet.
I always get quick professional personal service at this bank.
Pleasant but not so much chit chat that it slows me down.
Rarely any line and when there is they call another teller to help.
Convenient location on the nw corner of sunset and stephanie.
Plenty of parking and a drive thru.
This is a full service branch.
Regular and commercial customer lines.
Banking, mortgages, loans, investments and more.
Plenty of staff at around monday 2pm when walking in.
They moved the line really fast with 4 tellers and an information booth guy to help direct you.
They even have a couple computers for customers to use for accessing their online accounts.
I use to go here a lot but haven't lately.
Will go to this branch more often.
Top notch they were hitting on all cylinders today 6/18/12.
This bank is on the corner of 16th street and osborn.
There are two drive thru tellers and one walk up teller.
The location seems to always be busy and has bilingual tellers to assist spanish speakers.
This is an older location which is not as modern as most bofa's but it is always clean.
The tellers are friendly though plan on standing in life for a while as i mentioned it stays busy.
Isalliah made sure to answer all of my questions!
I definitely will be back .
Thank you isalliah for giving such great customer service.
There is no doubt that purchasing a home can be challenging.
Fortunately we had jeremy and the staff at pinnacle capital mortgage handling our mortgage needs.
From day one we received seamless efficient and professional care.
A sincere thank you to jeremy and the staff at pinnacle capital.
Jeremy from pinnacle capital mortgage corp is the best.
He made sure our new home purchase went as smooth and seamless as possible.
We really appreciate the work jeremy did to get us into our new home!
We highly recommend, i wouldn't go with anybody else.
I stopped by this location and met with an employee to fix my card and pin.
They were so nice and helpful and took care of the situation in about 10 minutes.
My native language is spanish and i was helped by someone that spoke spanish and was very helpful.
There was no line or wait.
I'm just happy to get this taken care of.
Highly recommend this branch.
I am a regular here.
I like this location.
The staff is friendly, and the drive thru banking is never too busy.
Otherwise, a great place to bank.
My experience was efficient, easy, and profoundly positive.
Lynn has shaped a wonderful team for this location, and chase is lucky to have someone like her representing them.
This bank is stupid.
I do not suggest going here.
The tellers were rude and unhelpful.
I've been banking at this branch since 2004.
The two drive-thru atms are convenient, and there is rarely a wait of more than one or two cars.
The same could be said for the single walk-up machine outside.
Inside, i have found the tellers to be well-trained and exceedingly friendly.
My single complaint about this branch is it often seems understaffed with tellers at the busiest times of the day.
I've always had great service at scefcu.
Now that they are open on saturdays it's even more convenient.
If this is the case, i would recommend chase for friendly, convenient service.
Trust me, i ain't shedding no tears when i break up with bank of america.
Every time i go to this wells fargo it is always an easy and informative trip.
They are extremely friendly and welcoming.
It doesn't appear as fake friendliness.
They try to help make the best of my account and suggest different ways to make banking easier.
Staff was super friendly in helping us close our accounts.
We got it all done in under 10 minutes!
Couldn't be happier with our visit to this location.
If i needed to visit another branch for some reason, i would come here!
I always feel that banks don't leave me, as a customer, with a lot of wiggle room.
I mean, they have my money.
Not the case here.
On more than one occasion, i've dropped in here during peak hours.
Even though it's been busy, not once have i had a negative customer service experience here.
Also, wells fargo customers get free notary services here.
So i recently popped in to get some stuff notarized, all on the free and on the quick.
No fuss, no muss, and no money spent.
More things should be like that.
This is my favorite wells fargo now!
If we could give it more stars we would !
We started using our normal chase bank where we have investements, retirements, checking, even being a private client there.
Big mistake,  we had to cease using them for our mortgage, no communication with us.
He said yes, and believe it or not , we signed all closing documents in exactly 2 weeks!
The team kept in touch with us at all times, worked beyond the 9-5 m-f hours.
If you need a mortgage, please, it will be stress free to deal with them.
We did it all via emails and scanning our documents.
It was so easy for us this way.
We are out of state, never had to visit him in person.
We cant say enough great things about jeremy and sharon and tyler for closing in 2 weeks.
Thank you so much.
How can you not give this bank a 5-star?
It opens on sunday, most banks don't.
It extend their business hours mondays thru fridays, most banks don't.
Seriously, do try them first before you give a bad review.
I love banking here, just used the notary service, no waiting in long lines.
Brett took care of us today.
I've had the pleasure of knowing sean overlock with state farm insurance both personally and professionally for numerous years.
The level of service sean and his office provide is second to none.
Sean is unquestionably an exceptional leader in the insurance world.
I would highly recommend sean and his state farm office with anybody looking for a top agent.
I had such a great experience at this branch, with switch my insurance thanks to maira.
I would highly recommend her to anyone, she truly goes above and beyond.
She found me the best coverage at an unbeatable price in a fast and timely manner.
I think this is the branch i go to... anyway, they are awesome!
The staff is very helpful, friendly and professional.
Why didn't she tell us the precaution before she ran the card in the first place?
No charges, just smiles and a 'have a happy weekend!'
On our way out the door.
Wells fargo definitely rocks :)
Took my suv in recently.
Very quick to diagnose and relay info.
Very fair priced and honset.
Also super quick had my car back very next day!
Will definitely be using again for my vehicle needs!
We now have a car person after a move to a different area!
I'm glad they now have an entrance from harris blvd.
Which allows it to be more convenient to myself and others who are coming from that direction.
I'm also glad they have two drive up atms now.
That is always a benefit/plus and a time saver.
Such wonderful and patient service and longer hours than other branches!
This branch saved me on a saturday.
Had some issues with online banking and sasha helped me settle everything, and did not rush me at all.
Every time i go into the branch the people friendly and organized.
I appreciate being able to make appointments.
I dont' like to go to banks.
I prefer direct deposit and getting cash when i checkout at the grocery or at circle k or the like.
I've had to go inside this location a couple times.
I had the best customer service.
They find ways to work with you.
They provide options that may help
Cashed a few checks at this branch.
The teller was very friendly and helpful.
I was in/out within 5 minutes and it was 11 am on a thursday.
Return factor - 80%
Dont really like coming on a friday because of course its payday and it gets very busy.
To my suprise yes it was busy but they had plenty of teller which was great.
Well, i guess things have really changed in 6 mos.
Care of customers is now of utmost concern here.
Everytime i come in i am helped with courtesy.
I present my id and ask for money.
He fills out the form.
He gives me money.
Thank you chase for understanding my needs!
Everyone in the bank was eager to help and make sure i was happy with their service.
I enjoyed my time inside the bank.
Thank you for everything.
I got to say i am amazed at how many navy federals there are in vegas.
I drive further to get to a navy federal when i lived in san diego.
This location which opened this year is very nice.
The teller was super friendly and between business questions we talked about good restaurants we both knew.
I have to say i had dreaded coming in but it was quick painless and a overall awesome experience.
This location is easy and convenient for those who live or work in sw vegas.
They have ample parking and the inside being so new is really nice.
Well laid out and easy to figure out what you need to do as soon as you walk in.
They also have a receptionist to ensure you end up in the right area.
Thanks navy fed for adding this awesome location to vegas!!
I am very impressed with this branch.
It is refreshing to receive such great customer service.
It's people like this that set chase above the other banks and why i prefer chase!
Look 4 stars for customer service at the drive thru.
The young guys here dress like old school bankers - real suit coat and tie.
Look, i appreciate it.
Takes me to the times when i was a little girl and people dressed for work.
Jeremy and his team at pinnacle capital mortgage went above and beyond during our whole selling and buying process.
As soon as i contacted jeremy, i received an instant reply addressing all my questions and getting the process started.
We got pre-approved very quickly, allowing us to know exactly what budget we have to work with.
We met him in person and went over everything.
He even recommended the real estate agent we ended up working with, who we loved as well.
Jeremy answered every email i sent him in less than an hour, even during nights and weekends.
He also gave us his personal number to contact him with questions/concerns at any time.
Their whole team is very organized and very thorough in everything they do.
I would highly recommend pinnacle capital mortgage.
I just joined this credit union and really like it.
Bebe is the best in setting up accounts and all the tellers are great.
Very nice branch with good service
Jeremy and team did an excellent job taking care of our refinance.
The process was so simple, quick, and effortless.
I would recommend working with him and pinnacle capital mortgage on any of your home finance needs!
I changed to state farm with wes stahler 11 years ago for home & auto.
I've had three incidents where i needed help during that time.
This guy is awesome.
Responsive, caring, dependable office staff and thorough follow up.
Can you really love your bank ?
Mid-first could be one ....
I originally opened an account at mid-first with no expectation thinking it just another bank.
I don't know how the training program is, but hand down the best banking experience i have had.
And they were never pushy toward any services making me very comfortable.
And agree with alan, the banking center is beautiful ....
(btw, i don't work for them, just impressed by their services)
In and out in no time flat.
Location is new, so building is brightly lit, modern design and all the bells and whistles!
Great place to bank with.
Also great care in establishing car and home loans.
Have been taken care of by this place in glendale az.
The folks are very down to earth, not fake in their care at all.
I am glad to be a customer to navy fed
This place is amazing it was fast, smooth, and everyone had a great customer service.
Especially miss kelsy, she was absolutely helpful.
Jeremy is incredibly responsive, easy to work with and answered every question we had quickly and efficiently.
He personally attended our closing and even brought a little closing gift.
We would highly recommend jeremy and his team to anyone making home purchase!
Always greeted very friendly when i walk in everyone eager to help me!
Awesome managers always ready to accommodate me!
Came in near closing time to cash a check and was asked if i'd like to open account.
Decided to go ahead and do it but was worried about the time.
I usually hate going to the bank but this was the best experience i've had
With all the media attention retail banks are getting for "new fees" less customer service etc.
Little things, like smiling friendly service, recognizing you when you enter and leave the bank.
Then she took the deposit behind the cage and brought me my receipt.
With their awsome bill pay service online and widely accepted debit card, im staying with wells fargo.
Keep up the good job!
The service is unparalleled and their knowledge and efficiency is unmatched!
Don't both with any other mortgage companies as this is the best i have ever witnessed!
We're not from the area so we relied on yelp reviews to find a lender for our home purchase.
I couldn't be happier with jeremy and his team and i feel lucky that we found them.
Both jeremy and his processor sharon were wonderful to work with.
Prompt, responsive, informative, and nice!
Pinnacle capital is incredibly professional and we closed on time without a hitch.
I highly recommend them and we'll definitely use them again in the future!
Busy branch and long lines but they run through the line quickly.
Branch is open later hours, love this!
The staff is awesome!
Really takes care of me and that deborah - amazing service.
Jeremy was a pleasure to work with.
We had a tricky situation and jeremy made it as easy as possible.
We closed on time with no additional costs.
I was greeted right away.
Since chase is doing away with the drive through service i had to come inside.
I brought my 5 week old baby in with me.
He informed me about the atm service where i can deposit checks and explained the chase app to me.
5's for this location
I want to thank bianca guzman for all the help she has given my mother and i on our accounts.
It's nice when your new to a city and have a person like bianca guzman help you get settled in.
Thank you very much for all your help and support.
I just closed on a new home yesterday.
My wife and i were both first time home buyers and had no idea how the whole process worked.
Jeremy and his team sent multiple emails a week to let us know where we were in the process.
We always knew where we stood through the entire escrow period.
All of our documents were sent through docusign so it was extremely efficient to get all the necessary paperwork submitted.
Jeremy helped to make our first time home purchase a breeze.
We weren't stressed out at all and knew where we were at each step of the process.
We couldn't have done this without your help, jeremy.
This is the closest location to me that's an actual bank, not just a free-standing atm.
I haven't had an issue with this particular branch since i started to use it three years ago.
I've been inside several times and frequently use the drive-up atm.
My issue was handled in a very professional and friendly manner.
We very much enjoyed working with andy gutman.
We are first time home buyers and we were a little intimidated going into it.
We also have unusual income sources and andy was patient and very helpful walking us through everything.
The experience was a very good one!
We felt a personal connection with andy and could tell he cared about getting us into our new home.
If i had 1 complaint, it would be weekend hours.
When did wells fargo or bofa ever do that for you?
I am finally home!
We recently purchased our first home with jeremy and pinnacle capital mortgage.
I am truly surprised with how simple and painless the entire process has been.
Jeremy also referred me to an amazing realtor, (tom barry with dpr) for which i am very grateful.
Wait times are not very long, staff is very friendly and helpful.
I've always walked right in and completed my transaction with in just a few minutes.
I've been a member of heartland credit union for about 34 years.
Service with a smile has always been the case, and i'm never just a customer.
If your money is in a bank, you're really missing out on the credit union membership experience.
Daysi provided excellent costumer service!
She gave me a good price for the vehicle i have thank you daysi!
Would recommend her to anyone.
Amazing service, this is a fine example of costumer service.
Location is easy to find.
I went to buy euro and gbp.
I have called many places at downtown and their prices were the lowest.
They gave me mixed bills.
Be sure to call different places and go to the best price one.
We've been extremely happy with the service at this branch.
He is a huge asset to the company and really cares about his clients.
We appreciate the entire team at the goodyear branch and would highly recommend to anyone!
Our refinance was quick, convenient, and got us exactly what we wanted.
Jeremy and team did an exceptional job in helping us to navigate this process.
His response time and commitment were exceptional.
Nice location, convenient hours, friendly staff - glad i made the switch to chase before moving west.
I opened my chase bank account at this location because it was close.
When i opened my account, my banker was friendly and gave me all the information i needed.
They're quick and friendly compared to other banks i've been to.
This branch was my home branch when i lived in shadyside.
We just moved into our new place!
Jeremy schachter and his team at pinnacle on 7th were fantastic!
It was awesome to work with them.
I would recommend jeremy and pinnacle to anyone!
This particular bank is extremely friendly!
She didn't just say "have a great day," she enthusiastically said "thank you for banking with us today!"
I was smiling when i left.
Jeremy has been my go-to mortgage broker for 9 years.
You won't get that anywhere else!
He is extremely knowledgeable and makes what can be a complicated, painful, and confusing process easy.
I highly recommend jeremy and pinnacle if you are buying a new home or refi'ing and want the best.
He will take care of you from start to finish.
This is a very well managed bank branch.
Basically, situation #1 involved a very dissatisfied customer arguing over $1.92 on a credit card she never used.
Grade a+ on this branch for handling this unruly customer and her attitude.
The 1950's called, they want their attitude back, lady.
Basically, situation #2 involved the teller machines *constantly* being empty or whatever.
Service trucks working double time here.
Grade a+ on this branch for handling the flow of money evenly and carefully.
Basically, situation #3 involved ... well... me.
I have had my mortgage with them a few months and so far it has been great.
While there is a drive-thru, the lobby doesn't seem to be busy at all.
Will certainly be back upon returning in 2016.
Working with zac and his team was a great experience.
Now days how often do you actually have to walk into a bank?
I don't do it that often personally.
There's a tv inset into the wall, tuned into a 24/hr news station.
Below that are 4 rows of back-lit shelving that go across the wall to hold magazines and newspapers.
Everyone in line was watching it.
No deep sighs at the wait.
No frustrated looking at the watch every 2 minutes.
Hmm... maybe that was money well spent?
Great benefits and customer service.
Diandra perone was fantastic at helping me change my name while the personal bankers were busy!
Thanks so much diandra you rock!
I came to wells fargo with my dad to address two issues.
Our total time there: 1 hour.
We sat down and explained our issue...  a minute later, solution in progress!
He was lightning fast in running numbers, trying to find the best outcome for my dad.
An hour and a half later we walked back into the bank and signed some papers.
Sean made it seem so easy.
Sean literally improved the quality of my dad's life with his resolution!
Too many businesses ignore the importance of customer service.
Not this wells fargo branch.
They treated us like friends helping friends.
Dad happy = sharon happy!
In and out in less than three minutes.
I went to exchange about us$750 to canadian dollars.
Xe.com had listed the exchange rate to be so that i will get about c$1015 back.
When all was said and done my 750 became about $1000 even in canadian.
The attendant had already taken any fees out of the money that i received.
She was very nice and smiled, and counted the money in front of me.
All the bills i received were in 20s and 50s, and appeared to be in good condition.
I was really impressed, since i had never exchanged money before.
All in all, great rate, fast, and pleasant service.
I'd definitely come here again.
Our account person apologized several times.
It would have been nice for the manager to apologize as well, but everything was fine.
I am 100% happy with bank of america service.
I am absolutely pleased at their genuine and outstandingly personal customer service.
The staff are helpfull, friendly, and professional, thanks for all that you do.
He was extremely knowledgeable, prompt, precise, and communicated with me every step of the way.
The process was made so smooth and painless and for that i am truly grateful i found them.
I would recommend them to anyone and can't wait to get to work with them again!
They are always super nice here.
Whenever there has been an issue, it has been quickly and professionally resolved to my satisfaction.
Best bank of america in vegas!
Ill never go to another location if i can help it!
Also love the atm deposit function!
One of the best decisions i've made switching to wells fargo bank.
They make everything so simple and efficient.
The employees are so help, polite and always have a smile on their face.
The only negative would be "my card never works to open the outside atm door after hours."
I come to this branch often because i work in the area.
I normally just stop in the drive thru tellers, but on occasion i have to venture inside.
I never leave without what i need or an answer to any questions i may have.
I drive an extra 15 min to go to this branch.
I have one right in my town and will go to this branch.
They go out of their way to help you and are very friendly.
They don't rush you even when there is a line.
This branch should be a training branch for other b of a employees.
Conveniently located inside safeway grocery store.
Always fast and friendly staff, easy to get in and out.
Has atm available with safeways hours.
Very pleased with us bank.
Jeremy and his team were outstanding.
It could not have gone smoother.
We were purchasing from out of state, but it felt like they were right down the street.
Their updates were timely and everyone knew what needed to be done.
When we found out we could close sooner, the team went into an even higher gear and made it happen.
We started out with a different lender, but after one conversation we knew that it was not a good fit.
That's when we found jeremy and his team.
We are so glad we made the move and we would recommend them to anyone!
Our real estate agent was equally impressed and said she would also use them in the future.
Today i had a harrowing experience.
I don't think i would wish this type of horror on anyone.
Well, i can think of maybe one or two people....
Well, i knew i didn't change the password so i immediately called the number provided.
There was a 15 minute wait time.
I stopped the car.
I looked at the e-mails while i was on hold.
All this while i am on hold with the bank.
My name is jodie rocco and my social is blah blah.
She told me to stay on the line and start providing information.
The closest wf i could find was flamingo/sandhill.
I was still on the phone with britney who told me not to hang up when i walked in.
I went to the first banker, fabiola ramirez, and said please help me.
Someone is transferring the contents of my bank account to unauthorized recipients as we speak.
She motioned for me to sit down.
I gave her my drivers license and bank card and my phone.
She calmly started her conversation with britney.
I had caught this breach in progress and it was scary.
An hour and a half later everything was rectified.
New account, new login, new password, new security on my account.
And most importantly, all my money was immediately returned to my account.
#life with me.... ; )
I been with ing direct for over 10 years!
I must say that i am really impressed with what they offer in terms of services and interest rates!
All the money transfers in and out of my bank account always in a prompt manners  interest rate.. sweet!
Tax saving account is at 3% with no commitment/minimum!
I love their website design and their sense of humour!
I never ever talk to anyone in person because i never have any problems with them at all!
One draws back is you have to have another account in a full service bank!
Consistent great customer service.
Front end staff are cordial at the very least.
Physical location is a bit of a drive for us.
Hence only 4 star.
However, they offer other conveniences that other banks or cu we used to do business with.
Fees are also minimal in contrast to the other financial institutions we used to bank with.
We like it here!
Dan ly is amazing!
Always smiling, quick and efficient!
Always makes my visit a pleasant one!
I have my safe deposit box here, although setting it up took over an hour.
They have plenty of people working inside this bank, and that is very rare for a bank these days.
This bank has always been well staffed when i go there and that is a big deal.
They have the small size safe deposit boxes and those are hard to come by.
Most branches have a waiting list, and tons of the massive boxes available.
This is a td facility yes but it does not have any tellers there.
If you're looking for us dollars you can't get it from the employees here since the employees are only advisors.
The hours are also later like some td branches, up to 8pm on weekdays.
I contacted pinnacle mortage based off their yelp reviews and they deserve all the praise.
I worked with zac and he was extremely helpful from day one.
I never felt intimidated during the mortgage process and he was always willing to help and give extra information.
He worked well with me and was accommodating to the unique situation i was in.
If i could give them more than 5 stars i most certainly would.
The loan process was extremely quick and zac did everything he could to make sure we closed in time.
If you're looking for a place to get a mortgage definitely check them out!
The staff at the stephanie location are some of the nicest people you will ever met.
They have tellers that speak fluent spanish too!
We love  our bank!
They are always ready to help if an issue arises and we have so many options to get assistance.
There are many nationwide locations  a great benefits.
I visited this branch at the first bank yelp event!
The branch in itself is quite different with no tellers and only advisers.
The staff was very friendly and bank manager andrew was just awesome!
They also take coins.
They do all the work for me and i just go and sign the paperwork...
Cindy helped me with some questions i had about getting alone.
She was amazing and super helpful!
I will definitely return for her help again!
Gosh i love this bank.
Today i stopped in to get approved for a vehicle loan and kirsty took care of me.
Extremely knowledgable and friendly.
She explained everything in detail and covered all my options.
So refreshing dealing with a bank with your best interest in mind that looks out for you.
Thank you navy federal & kirsty :)
If already didn't have a bank i would move.
My experience for notary services was unbelievable.
I popped in the other day per recommendation of a neighbor.
I had heard notary services were available to non-members.
(the nearest location of my bank is aaaaallll the way in peoria.
When i opened the doors i initially thought i was in the wrong place.
It felt like an architect design studio.
But no, the smiling receptionist assured me i was, indeed, in a bank.
She also confirmed notary services were available and waved me over to the teller area.
I still had a feeling of disbelief that i was in a bank when i walked over.
A) everyone seemed to be having an incredibly good time.
(it was the middle of the day and i felt like it was happy hour.)
B) i was greeted like the second coming of a vip.
(mean while i was slumming it in a pair of shorts.)
C) the interior of this place only got better.
D) everyone that works there is movie star beautiful.
(not that this is relevant to customer service.
I was directed to sit in the couch area to wait for the notary.
I snapped a few photos but really did not do justice to capture the beauty of the space.
If i could live in the space, well, yes, that would be nice.
He's possibly the nicest person.
It's very difficult to write words to describe a customer experience that goes above and beyond...anything.
I don't even have the papers that were notarized (is that even a word?)
To pull up his name.
But i could share the stories we traded.
(but i won't - they're mine!
:)   i didn't want to leave.
And then i was a bit stunned that the notary service was free of charge.
Such a great bank.
I like this place and i'm going to stay for a long time.
Hope more people join.
I have a loan and two business accounts with this place.
Asu students get free checking accounts.
Besides that there are many different account types, personal and business, to fit your custom needs.
The branch manager,  michael, goes above and beyond for his clients.
The tellers and personal bankers are all really nice and helpful.
The bank inside and out is beautiful.
Feels like a high scale hotel and not your run of the mill bank, very high quality.
Even though it's a nice looking bank i stay because of the service.
Top notch in every sense of the word.
I've had bank accounts at several different banks and this is by far the best.
They do things the right way.
I always get fast immediate service and all the staff remember you.
You're not just a number.
I like the fact that they're open 7 days a week and from 7am-7pm (sat and sun are shorter hours).
I also like that they're privately owned.
Maybe the reason for their differences from other banks.
I have been to this us bank several times since i moved here in december.
I have always had a good experience and have been helped each time.
They answered all my questions about the credit card and explained perfectly how it worked.
Really swell guys and gals there!
The wf branch on flamingo and ft. apache is too crowded and not enough bank tellers.
I prefer going to this one.
Annie vuong is my personal banker and she's always helpful when i want to inquire about anything.
It's somewhat fast and efficient with bank teller services.
I have to say the most quickest branch is sahara and rainbow.
When i want to deposit, i try later in the afternoon.
Lunch time and morning seems crowded.
Don't bank here but always use their atm machines and cash checks here.
Drive thru atm and teller services.
Walk up atm also.
Have never had an issue with them.
Very convenient for me and it gets the job done.
Jeremy and the team at pinnacle mortgage were amazing.
Every question was answered within an hour.
Every issue was cleared up with minimal stress or distraction to me.
The knowledge,  service and abilities of jeremy and the team are unparalleled.
First, this is the only location that is open one hour later than all the others.
My appreciation for that additional hour, is beyond words!
I had a bit of trouble regarding an appointment that was set my an associate here.
I did not receive a confirmation.
My appointment was set for first thing in the morning on a monday.
My only choice was to show up at the assigned time.
Unfortunately, this location is quite far from where i live.
I was definitely frustrated to find my appointment was not set at the given time.
Luckily rebecca was taking care of me.
She gave me a call shortly after to reschedule my appointment for later that day.
As much as it was inconvenient i made another trip back.
Upon arriving the person i was meeting with was an additional hour late!
Sometimes you have to swallow the things that are out of your control.
Rebecca went out of her way to make sure my experience was pleasant.
She turned a bad day upside down.
She made everything worth it in the end!
I love truwest credit union.
Joined many years ago when it was still the motorola credit union.
The staff is very friendly (almost like family or friends).
All of our accounts are now with truwest.
Stellar service, employees are very friendly specially ryan he is my favorite.
I rarely actually go to a bank.
Crazy i know but i am one of those  people who never carries cash.
They have two which is ideal and less of a wait.
Quick and easy transaction.
No wait and no line up.
The only branch in north america with such a set-up.
It's like the disney office of td bank.
The psychedelic bead curtain waiting area, lamps, everybody is serving you coffee, tea or water.
They don't have tellers what eliminates the "miserable person in a box" element.
Very relaxed, great team of employees!
I'm sitting here right now after getting my stuff done and i don't want to leave.
Andrew ostos, the branch manager might need to kick me out!
It's like i'm hanging with my buddies...who give great financial advice.
Thoroughness, professionalism and patience are the adjectives that come mind for this whole team.
I will never refer anyone to another broker and will definitely be back with all my future business.
I have been in uc area for 2 yrs and i think this is one of the best panda express.
The servers that i encountered were all nice and friendly!
The bankers here at midfirst bank are the nicest and are very kind and helpful here.
And they are very kind with helping you out with starting your bank account here at midfirst bank.
Since i am out of state, i had to do everything via phone and email.
Zac, jeremy, and sharon were responsive, clear, and made good on their commitments.
The best home financing experience i have ever had.
Painless refinance process that was done from initial phone call to signing papers in less than a month.
We had a difficult situation and these guys stepped up and delivered!
Can't say enough about a company that looks out for their customers!
Long story short, a teller made a mistake (understandable, this happens) that caused us some major issues.
Leadership looked at this as an opportunity to work with their team and make it right.
Bottom line, they listened and did the right thing!
We felt respected and appreciated as a customer!
Great experience yesterday at chase.
I needed a wire transfer.
Shout out to ben!
He was so helpful and took the time to explain, since i never before had one done.
Very professional and superior customer service.
Thank you mr benjamin.
I just recently purchased a house that i fell in love with the moment i saw it.
Thanks to zac and his team tyler and sharon that made my home buying process easier than ever.
Zac has been wonderful in helping me make this a smooth and enjoyable experience.
Within 3 weeks they have made it to closing before christmas :) it was like a christmas gift for me.
Normally it takes a lot longer time to close but they make things possible for you!
:) best company and hassle free and headache free.
Isai juarez just took care of my banking needs, very pleasant experience!
Every thing was easy and he guided me through all the steps.
He also gave me advice on some future accounts i need to open!
Trisha ayers goes above and beyond for her customers.
Our accounts were hacked and she's spent hours with us to remedy the problem.
Everyone always told us how difficult it is buying a home.
The whole time during our home buying process, we were just waiting for problems, expecting some delay.
Jeremy and his team made the process so simple and straightforward.
I highly recommend them to anyone who will listen.
This was the second loan i closed with jeremy and his crew.
Super smooth, clean transaction.
The best in the biz as far as i am concerned.
He got my home purchase loan back in 2009, and now we are closing in 3 days on my refinance.
What a fantastic team.
Jeremy, sharon and marcea were all sensational.
Their penchant for details is their key to success.
Oh, by the way did i mention their fantastic customer-oriented service.
If i could throw in another five stars on top of the five i have already given them, i would.
Great job you guys!
Tim and henry s.
I recently opened a business account with m and i bank and i am so happy!
There you don't have a personal banker, you're lucky to get a call back.
However, at m and i bank, they take your relationship with them seriously.
You have your own personal banker who helps you with anything you need.
And the tellers are awesome, friendly, and helpful.
They even called me by name!
If you're not happy with your current banking situation, i highly recommend m and i bank!
Good auto loan rates  quick service.
Good auto loan rates
As a long time bank of america customer :  i.
Chase is everything b of a isn't.
Chase doesn't even ask for one, they do it for you!
They also have a drive-through (unlike ba) and much longer hours.
I had been with b of a for 20+years  and never realized how bad they sucked.
I like that they specialize in assisting military personnel & their families with banking needs.
The people who work here are very helpful, knowledgeable & friendly.
I recently vacationed in costa rica and had leftover money to change back into canadian dollars.
I was also preparing for a trip to thailand and indonesia, and converted money.
They were very helpful and i found the fee to be minimal compared to other places.
This place is the best!!
They have better rates than the big banks and they are always friendly and helpful down there.
Also, they don't gouge you with fees like the big banks.
They have no atm withdrawal fees at any credit union atm.
Why do  you still do your banking at chase, bank of america, us bank, or any other large bank again???
I just refinanced my auto loan with america first.
I'm happy with the service, location, hours and accessibility of this company and employees.
I love wells fargo!
This one is a nice, clean facility with friendly tellers.
If you're in chandler definitely give this bank a shot!
Over a month or so ago, i was in the beginning stages of looking into buying a car.
I was extremely thankful for kevin for taking the time to answer my questions and for educating me.
He was extremely understanding and never once made me feel as if i was inconveniencing him.
I thanked him very much and i would like to recognize him on this review as well.
During this time, i also had a conversation with kathleen.
Thankfully, (1 month later) i accidently kept her contact information.
I called kathleen who immediately her call and put me at ease.
I am truly thankful for the work these individuals do, day in and day out.
I use this bank often to make deposits for the bossman, and only through the drive-thru.
The tellers are always courteous and quick.
Nothin' to complain about!
Been banking with third fed.
For 35 years and will continue to do so.
I do miss the olmsted falls branch because the n.o.
Location is often inconvenient.
This chase bank is very friendly and fast compared to most around here.
The lines are much smaller than the one at decatur and sahara, and they also have extra drive up lanes.
I used yelp to help me find a good mortgage broker.
The reviews were very good for pinnacle capital mortgage corp on 7th.
I followed the reviews and very glad i did.
Jeremy and zac at pinnacle mortgage were very pleasant, helpful and informative.
I only had to go to the office once, because i didn't have a fax machine.
Both were very prompt and good about answering the questions i had.
The process is easy and mostly done on line.
I had a pre-approval letter in less than a week.
I got frequent updates via e-mail to keep me updated on the process.
I highly recommend pinnacle capital mortgage on 7th.
Ave, if you are looking for a mortgage loan.
Jeremy even came to my signing.
That is the first time a lender has ever done that for me.
I have been a member ever since nv federal (now one nevada) changed its deposit policies.
Almost 2 years now.
I have an automatic transfer from my account to my child's account.
One day i noticed that the transfer hadn't shown up on the child's account.
The help person actually thanked me for bringing it to their attention so they could correct it immediately.
When was the last time you heard that from bofa, chase or anyother national bank?????
Pros: (1) free checking.
I mean truly free checking.
No nickle and diming you to death.
Miniscule interest (currently 0.05%) is paid on balances over $500.
(2) free atm withdrawls at cooperating member atms (3) did i mention free checking?
I'm so happy this location is open on saturdays.
I live like a minute a way from this branch which is very convenient!
They truly go above and beyond!!
Their app is so easy to use and i love all the features they have on their website!
You can also check your free credit score on their website.
I usually don't go in for a deposit transaction since i always use the atm for deposits.
Today (saturday), i decided to go in the branch to make a deposit to avoid an over draft payment.
Their were a few people in line including myself waiting for the branch to open at 9am.
Their were no signs showing the office was closed.
We were all frustrated!
About 9:30am is when he finally put a sign showing branch is closed.
Their were a few of us inline waiting for nothing for the past 30 minutes.
This is the only bad experience i've had since i've been banking with them.
Have been a member of this credit union for about 5 years.
A friendly neighborhood credit union.
Not our usual location, but had to stop in here at very nearly closing time.
Greeted as we entered and the place was busy.
Still, did not have to wait and was taken care of quickly.
Jeremy and his team were great to work with on our home purchase.
We shopped around and came back to his team because of the rates and responsiveness that they had.
It was a pleasure working with jermey and his team on our new home purchase.
They answered all the questions that we needed and helped us understand everything.
All the transaction went smoothly and quick.
I can't wait to do more business with them in the future.
Thanks again you guys for all the hard work you guys did!
Jeremy and 76 mortgage made my goal of purchasing my home a reality.
Jeremy stayed in constant contact with me and answered any and all questions i had.
I highly recommend 76 mortgage to all first time home buyers.
They were equally as pleased and have now used 76 mortgage for their refinance.
I love my home and am very happy i chose jeremy and 76 mortgage to make it happen!
Have been banking with truwest cu since i was a kid and my dad opened my first savings account.
Their services are great and have been very helpful over the years.
Highly recommended for their savings and checking account options.
Had to stop off at the atm for some cash.
Was in and out very fast.
Very impressed with this branch location.
The assistant branch manager nicole koubek was extremely helpful in addressing my banking needs and provided awesome customer service!
One of the best banks i've ever had the pleasure doing business with.
This branch reflects the quality of customer service that i've come to expect from this credit union.
I appreciate that it fills the gap of coverage in the southwest part of las vegas.
The drive up atms are very convenient and has given me a new appreciation for this bank.
There are two drive up atms and a teller window.
At least one atm is available 24 hours a day.
If you're looking for a credit union, try this one.
Forget the big giant banks.
They're nothing compared to this one.
I've been with america first credit union in one way or another since 1997.
Excellent sophisticated , yet personal service.
So very happy that they are serving the southern nevada community with such care.
If you miss your small credit union or bank, this credit union is the one!
When i dream of the perfect credit union this is what my dreams look like!
This branch should be a role model for all branches!
This is my second loan with sun american mortgage, and i will use them for all my future mortgage needs.
They were professional, responsive, fair, understanding, and pleasant to work with.
I would highly recommend sun american mortage to anyone, and consider them the best in arizona.
I opened my accounts up in the dobson/main branch some time ago.
I have had nothing but excellent  customer service.
Truwest has so many benefits that i have started refering friends and family.
I have enjoyed the special attention and all the perks of the membership.
She took her time with me to understand my needs.
Hard to come by nowadays with the fast lives we live.
Dyrce wished me good luck.
I thank you dyrce for caring and thank you tru west for employing top noch people!!
P.s i am working on my third referral
This truwest credit union is awesome, the workers are nice people who are always able to assist.
It is in a very convenient location too.
The atm outside though is very slow... but overall a great bank.
I have visited this wells fargo a few times and i have never had any problems here.
Case in point, when i went there today, a staff member greeted me as i entered the bank.
It was slow and so i was quickly able to deposit my cash with a friendly cashier.
Best regards, james "culinary schmooze" williams
I have had my insurance with this company for about 23 years now.
They have always been very helpful to me in all situations.
I have my car and home.
Also my family members came here for insurance as well.
You can do everything over the phone, or by email, or even go there in person.
All requests are taken care of immediately so how can you beat it?
If you need insurance this is a very good choice.
Randy apologized for the way his staff handled.
I recently called and had a new quote done and sharon was awesome.
I apologize for my earlier comments they do care about there customers
A special thanks to all of u who signed my get well card-it meant so much to me.
Thanks again for the best service ever.
This bank of america is small, but convenient to my house and the customer service is always on point.
There is always an employee there to greet you at the entrance which is nice.
I mainly use the location for deposits and withdrawals, but most recently i had to make a wire transfer.
Unlike standing in the regular line i needed to see one of the personalized bankers, special.
Overall, a bank of america branch that is there to serve is customers.
Open later than most banks which is a major perk for me.
Staff is exceptionally friendly.
The manager christian is a pleasure to deal with also.
He is professional and very helpful.
I'll be coming back to this branch for all future transactions.
The branches nearby aren't quite as impressive.
Dave and his team handled my home purchase.
They were prompt to reply to my questions.
He thoroughly explained my loan options so i could make the best decision for my situation.
His team kept me regularly updated throughout my loan process.
My closing went very smooth and the loan funded right away after i signed.
I would recommend them!
Tyler helped me when i did not know he was.i would recommend him to anyone,and take his advice
This is an very nice bank.
Located at the waterfront it is convenient to other shopping.
It is a large space has atm and drive through tellers.
It offers incentives for customer referrals and has plenty of parking.
Attractive space, ample parking and convenience make this an attractive banking location.
He really made me feel at home.
I want to commend sce for having a great branch and classy employees like phil.
Excellent service i received at this location the many times i've been here.
The staff is very friendly and helpful.
Great experience with fairway!!
Zac and his team (martin, priscilla and sharon) we attentive, responded quickly to all my phone calls and emails.
They take the time to explain the process and any questions i had until i understood clearly.
They make you feel as a valued customer and they are working for your best interest.
They were able to close in less than 30 days with no issues or time constraints.
5 stars well earned!
Jeremy and his team are a top-notch, well-oiled, highly polished machine.
Jeremy's number one priority is ensuring his clients are completely satisfied with their home purchase.
He is his client's biggest advocates, which is why his clients return time after time again!
All the time !!!!
Always available to take care of my needs no matter how big or small it would be !
I am moving to nv and my current bank has no locations in nv so i popped into us bank.
One less star for banking fees.
My current bank has free banking with no minimum balance.
Working with jeremey and his team was a great experience.
I woul highly recommend pinnacle and jeremey's team!
Was referred to this bank by my grandma.
I set up a new account today as well as my savings and the overall experience with her was wonderful!
She made me feel comfortable and right at home.
She also informed me of all the perks as well as how to get my $25 amazon card!!
She really took her time with setting up everything and making sure everything was done correctly.
I thought it was all amazing!
If you're thinking about banking here do it and go see beatrice!!!
You won't regret it!!
By far the best experience i've had at any bank!
I called and talked to a joseph and he was so helpful and nice.
He helped me with a fraudulent transaction with my account since i was having trouble talking to someone.
I'm so happy he was so helpful!
I love this location.
The people are courteous and friendly, and i have never had to wait in line.
To make a very, very, very long story short: i am a recent convert to wells fargo.
My thanks to tom and his staff for making what could have been a nightmare into a good experience!
I love this location!
They have a drive-up with 2 lanes, outside atm and the inside is beautiful, inviting and the tellers are great!!
They recognize me even though i'm only in there once or twice a month.
The location is easy to drive into and there is always parking.
They always have cookies and coffee and occasionally someone playing the piano.
They immediately refuned me back $206.
Which helped for the time being.
I am very impressed by them and will continue with them for years to come!!!
I recommend them if you are looking to leave the big guys!!
Andy gutman is one of the top loan officers in las vegas by far !
He worked around my work schedule and ever met us on saturday !
That customer service !
He made it easy to understand the loan process !
I would , and have already recommended him to my friends !
Rms is lucky to have someone as dedicated as andy gutman !
Jeremy and his team were fantastic!
I swore it was like they only worked for me.
They always were just a phone call or email away.
Jeremy was amazing at answering any and all of my million questions that came up throughout the process!
Jeremy and his team made my re-fi easy.
Everything was well organized and i closed as soon as i came home to arizona.
The closing was scheduled at my office so i had minimal interruptions to my day.
Thank you jeremy and team for making this process easy so that i could concentrate on my family.
I'm tired of fighting with yelp about this location.
I mean why would you listen to a person that reports here and has reported here for work for years.
The va as we all know is a hospital system that serves our veterans.
The address is very generic.
If you still have no idea it is located on the hilltop overlooking pitt university.
The va offers an array of clinics, surgeries, and testing under one roof.
Also housed within is a patriot store for your shopping needs, this isn't your usual hospital gift shop.
Patriot cafe for your dining needs.
Va pittsburgh federal credit union for your banking needs.
Two atms, one located at the main entrance from the parking garage and one located in the patriot cafe.
Drop boxes for postal pick up.
Starbucks coffee with a small cafe setting.
Did i mention that parking is free here?
When the parking is nearing capacity that is when the valet service really ramps up their service here.
Also there is a bus stop located out front and shuttle service between facilities.
Best banking experience i have received by-far!
Been with them for less than 3 months and their customer service has one-upped any other institution i've been with.
I was entirely caught off guard that she was so kind to offer such a kind gesture.
She said it was my first occurrence so she would take care of it as a courtesy.
I was just very impressed by the initiative she took to provide anticipated customer service.
I wasn't expecting her to waive the fees, but she kindly offered the service with a smile on her face.
Great customer service still exists in this world!
Jeremy and his team were great on our cabin refinance.
It was a simple process and went smoother than any we have done before.
The team is friendly and quick.
I was in a bind and needed to get my diesel fixed in a hurry.
I found this place through yelp.
They offered towing and it had good reviews.
Matt knows his business and told me exactly what the issues were.
No sugar coat just an honest, accurate assessment.
He fixed my truck quickly and charged very fair rate.
Lynn and the ladies in her office go the extra mile when there is a claim or issue.
If you are looking for a more personal experience with you agent, this office is a good one.
I love this bank!
Great atm, never any problems.
And whenever i have to go inside, the customer service is outstanding.
Came in around noon and there was a very short line.
The staff was warm and friendly.
Setup an appointment for a service need.
Employees greeted warmly and quickly took us to the specialist that was going to assist.
Specialist was efficient and friendly.
There's also atms inside and out of this branch and investment and mortgage specialists.
I love banking with u.s. bank.
This specific branch is always so helpful and they are very knowledgeable with all products.
I would highly recommend opening up accounts with this branch!
I recently purchased my first home, which was an exciting, but overwhelming process.
I would absolutely recommend working with him!
I truly feel that i'm in good hands with jeremy and the tobias team.
I don't bank with wells fargo but i do end up in this branch about once a month.
They are so nice and helpful!
I prefer credit unions over banks because the rates are better and it supports the state/community you live in.
This credit union also doesn't charge for keeping your own money in safe keeping.
Where as the larger banks have monthly fees, minimum requirements, and every other fees you can make up.
Supporting credit unions is my preference and i really like america first credit union.
We recently closed on our new home and what a great experience it was!
Yes, there were deadlines and a lot of paperwork.
Krista dalton was so helpful and friendly!
We were in the middle of a stressful move and working with krista was a breath of fresh air.
Came to this location to be added on to an account.
We were greeted immediately by the manager.
While we waited i saw him interact with several customers.
It was so nice to be in such a relaxed, personable, yet professional environment.
This review is really about trish.
My wife and i had the pleasure of working with her, and she was very helpful.
Very friendly, knowledgeable, and made us laugh so hard my cheeks were red!
You made our visit a memorable one.
She helped us in every way she could.
She is a great access to sce.
Thank you again ludi murillo for your great help.
Assisted me in setting up at home access.
As a new account holder, i appreciated the time and thoughtfulness i was provided.
I won't use anyone else.
We felt no pressure.
Then once we were ready he saw to every detail and made the process very easy.
I highly recommend them.
Jeremy and his team are incredible.
The level of service was on point.
They walked me through everything always keeping in touch and never let down.
I was so nervous about buying my first house and these guys took away every fear i had.
I'd recommend them to anyone who's nervous about buying their first home.
Hands down the best bank in az.
Three reasons why i chose midfirst: 1.
I can use any atm anywhere and midfirst reimburses the fees 2.
Open 7 days a week, extended hours m-f 7am- 7pm 3.
Great customer service and a stunning banking center.
"nia and the team at the warner branch are amazing.
I have been a member with truwest a little over a year now & i love it.
Every time i go into this location it feels like home.
Nia is someone i deal with every time i visit and she makes me feel welcomed all the time.
Thank you nia & team at tuewest (warner location)  i would highly recommend !
Never have i had a better customer service experience with a financial institution.
I will be giving them all of my business based on how i was treated today.
After only 3 to 4 visits to this location i was greeted by name!
Always pleasant and courteous, but never in a fake or waste of time way.
Drea and tom were great!
I have been with this credit union for 25 years.
This branch is fantastic.
I have all of my auto loans through america first credit union.
I prefer to buy low mile used vehicles from private parties and america first is always accommodating.
They know their stuff.
I highly recommend emma gonzales.
The people working here are nice and remember you because they are attentive.
I cant say this is the best chase i have been to.
But i leave happy every time i have came in here.
This is what the experience i would expect from any bank location.
The tellers were very helpful and super nice!!
The boa in belmont could learn a lot from this location!
Special shout-out to jennifer bagget, who is absolutely lovely and helpful.
I recently lost my father and didn't really know where to begin with the finances he left behind.
I walked into the chase bank branch at 35th ave and peoria and met with erica yanez.
She was patient and listened to my concerns and guided me with her expertise in all of my banking needs.
She will always be my go to person throughout this journey and in the future.
Thank you so much erica yanez.
I was helped over the phone by makenna & i must say she is the sweetest most helpful employee there!!
Super fast payment process & asked if i needed anything & was just great customer service.
Melody h., in the mortgage department, was amazing!
The supervisor initially refused to alter a service.
I explained the situation and she made the magic happen.
I was very impressed with both melody and her supervisor.
Overall, in the 5 years we have had a mortgage with national bank, we did have a 5-star experience.
Melody's outstanding customer care showed me that there are still people who care in bureaucratic systems.
Just signed up today for a savings account with america first credit union.
I have read other reviews on yelp and decided to give it a try.
I was greeted by emma ruth gonzales upon arriving.
Everything took no more than 30 minutes to complete.
I will be doing further busniess at this location.
Always helped right away with super quick and helpful service.
I deal with chase bank frequently and prefer wells fargo (& specifically this location!)
I've always had fast and friendly service here.
I'm happy to say there is never a wait.
It's typical corporate bologna, they have little say.
Overall a nice bank.
But using jeremy as my broker made the experience so much better than i anticipated!
His customer service is superb and i would recommend him to everyone, he does not disappoint!
Sean overlock/state farm has been great to work with and the experience was professional and focused on me, the customer.
I recently moved my policies (auto, home, life) from another carrier and my overall savings is approx 17%.
I also feel better with the financial stability of state farm, but most importantly, the service from sean.
Bankers pei or fernando are very gracious and helpful!
Oct 4 2018.....love them ....my dog daisy enjoys the china town location.
Year of the dog!
We are on facebook.
I would highly recommend this credit union.
I own a small business and had gone to chase to open a business checking account.
I left chase bank and drove over to the intouch credit union on w. lake mead blvd.
I was immediately helped and opened a checking account for my business in about 30 minutes.
I found them to be extremely helpful and courteous.
I do whatever i can with my business at a credit union.
It's clear the bigger banks like chase couldn't care less about small business owners.
When i reached for the door, someone beat me to it.
An employee flung open the door and held it like a doorman.
He didn't just give me a shallow greeting the way they do at my bank of america branch.
He asked how he could help me.
I explained my situation.
With crisply professional aplomb, he directed me to a window where he proceeded to dispatch my request.
He looked to be barely in his 20s.
Glancing about the branch i didn't see any employees who appeared to be over 23.
They all seemed thrilled to have jobs.
I have just one word to describe mary vrana and her team!!
Exceptional... mary made this home loan process very smooth.
I experienced a few bumps on the way but mary always helped me sort them out in a cool manner.
Thx again mary vrana....
It's hard to argue with the full services that wells fargo provides - quite comprehensive.
One of my businesses banks here and we're always treated professionally and positively.
I would highly recommend jeremy and his team!
They made the process of getting a home loan seamless and surprisingly easy.
Been banking here since i was born - wouldn't want to switch to another.
2 atms - not very busy so rarely ever any line up.
In fact, i've never seen one.
We worked with jeremy and our loan process went smoothly.
He closed the loan two weeks early.
The lender fees were just as described from the beginning.
The people working here are so nice and so informative!
They walk you through every step of your loan!
When in a pinch for extra cash this is the best choice.
6 payments and you are done!
No hassle to go into office to pay interest its all automatic!
Some of the rc locations are not as helpful or nice!
Will continue to use this location when needed.
I love coming to this chase because everyone is so welcoming and friendly.
Ahmed goes above and beyond to help and take care of what you need.
And he always seems so happy and chipper.
Is this a bank?
Or is it café?
The answer is that it is both!
(i think this offer ends end march, usually you get $25 for referrals.)
It's not a traditional bank so they don't take cash deposits, and everything was done on an ipad.
Message me if you have any questions!
Zac was fast, efficient, and easy to work with.
The entire re-fi process always seems like a ton of work- but honestly not at all!!!
I really enjoyed working with his team and i would highly recommend them to all my family and friends!
Everything went smoothly and there were no surprises!
We can't say enough about jeremy's attention to detail, quick and clear communication and knowledge of his craft!
During our first conversation he went over our credit and available products.
We met with him again when we were ready to buy and closed on our property within 3 weeks.
Thank you jeremy and team, we will be sending friends and family your way as needs come up!
I have 2 auto loans with them, got really good rates.
I got pre approved online and transactions were swift in the physical branch.
We were helped right away at this durango branch.
Next is my mortgage refinancing.
I'll update once that was completed.
Signing up with  state farm, i was a bit skeptical that saving money was a possible.
After being with geico for so long and actually taking a penalty, a bump my monthly insurance cost.
I decided to look elsewhere for a better rate and service.
Joy and company make you feel wanted and apart of their family.
When it came time to get a first time mortgage my realtor said he only recommended one person, rusty.
I'm glad he did.
Rusty is friendly, helpful, and very easy to work with.
He couldn't have made the process any easier.
I highly recommend him for all your mortgage needs.
It's going up in a great area with plenty of access.
The customer service is wonderful at this bank!
The person who signed me up ( kevin?)
Was so friendly and accommodating, and not in that forced way, genuinely nice!
The tellers i've dealt with have all been so helpful.
This is the best bank i've ever worked with.
I want to thank everyone at sfm, they made our dreams come true!
We now have our first home!
Leilani, michelle, deborah, and rose were amazing throughout the whole process!
I had no problems with paperwork, responses, and communication.
They are the best at what they do!
And those who worked behind the scenes, your work did not go unnoticed!
Everybody guided me to stay on top of my credit and finances, especially in this sellers' market!
You won't regret choosing sfm for your mortgage needs!
As a first-time homebuyer, they truly exceeded all expectations of the home buying process!
I've already told all my friends and family about them!
I've used gravity finance to help get me start up capital.
They helped me and it was actually a very easy process.
I thought you had to put up your house, car kid and wife to get a start-up loan, guess not.
This is by far the best branch i have ever been to.
I've been a member for 6 years and have never experienced better service every time i visit.
Today i was privileged to be serviced by daniel and alex.
They were very not only prompt in responding to my needs, but very professional and gave that extra tlc.
Thanks a million to these guys.
What i like about steve's place, besides the proximity to home, is that he has great people working for him.
The front desk is friendly and welcoming.
You are greeted into the office like family.
Alex went above and beyond to help me with my jewelry quote.
He even took time out of his day to drive me to the appraiser and waited patiently with me.
Steve reached out and went way beyond what an agent should do to keep a customer.
He helped me out when the quote was a bit more than i thought it would be.
I felt like more than just a customer.
I felt like the office wanted to get to know me and create a long lasting relationship.
Kudos to you steve and alex!
Keep up the great atmosphere!
I really like the british guy from wales - although he needs to shave.
The manager is a very smaht fellow.
Such wonderful people will always do what's right.
Duvid is my main man!
This is the best bank i have had to deal with.
From the security person at the door, to the tellers, everyone is super nice and respectful.
I've always had very pleasant conversations.
Employees know how to do their job well, they are very well informed about the banking business in america.
Customer service on the phone is very helpful, too.
I've always been able to do what i needed online.
I sent an e-mail, got a quote, went in and exchanged my money.
Fast and professional is all you should want when exchanging money.
They gave me a great rate too.
I'll use them from now on.
I would highly recommend.
It great being a member of a credit union
Dan was on point from the start.
Knowledgeable, thorough, with excellent follow up and follow through.
Dan made sure the process concluded with an early close of escrow.
I strongly recommend dan for your mortgage needs.
Dan makes it happen!
She was very helpful the whole way through.
She responded to every question with accuracy and kindness.
Interacting with abby was the best experience i've had at wells fargo.
Enjoyed getting to know them and talk to them while im doing my banking business.
Recommend this location if your close by the neighborhood !
Have been banking with them for over 20 years.
No issues, always great service, super friendly people!
Just opened a new account today.
My banker was alexandra vu and she was absolutely wonderful!
She was extremely thorough and made sure i understood everything before i left.
I recently moved here from arizona.
A really great, large, branch.
A half dozen inside tellers, four outside drive-up tellers, a couple atm's, one drive up, one walk-up, etc.
They are unfailingly friendly and polite, always seem eager to help during each of my dozens of visits there.
So far so great- just obtained a car loan and the value and services offered were great.
We brought 3 checking accounts here from a bank and so far so good.
The staff is friendly and the location is good for us.
Loving the flexibility with some of the arms in the network.
Overall i'd recommend this credit union.
Wonderful option in a city built on big banks picking your pocket.
All people that are not making money with their banks should immediately switch to a credit union.
Wish it was closer, but 2 miles isn't too bad.
Very friendly and helpful.
Good price for my precious diamonds.
Fair prices and respectful shop.
It was a pleasure doing business with them.
I'm sure i will be back again.
My whole family has always used bdcu.
I've had a savings account with them since i was a child in the mika mika club.
I now do my checking with them as well, and i am so glad i do.
I was recently scammed for a pretty large amount of money.
I am a young adult and this was my first time experiencing something so violating.
Linda eugster took care of me as if it was her own daughter who got scammed.
Linda and bdcu make me feel safe with my banking, and i would not go anywhere else.
They treat you like family, and you can't find that anywhere else.
Mary was so helpful and walked us through everything, explaining everything in detail before we signed!
Great company and will be using them again in the future!
Tellers are fast and friendly.
Brian, the relationship manager is the best.
He makes dealing with various banking issues a breeze, and he's kind and funny to boot.
The only place i trust to store my valuables.
Many of my friends got a safe box here thro the years and i decided to get one as well.
After few years of great service it's time for me to leave a review and spread the word.
If you need a safe deposit box and don't want to deal with the banks - this is your place!
But most of them have not forgotten me since.
Though wf is fairly large, i still get that small bank feeling when i go there.
I worked with john jensen, an insurance account representative, and he helped make switching insurance companies easy and enjoyable.
He went above and beyond to ensure my satisfaction.
Wells fargo is the best bank in this country.
This is not my favorite location but if i just need to get cash quick, the location is quite convenient.
For foreign currency exchange and other services, go somewhere else.
I've used interchange about 5 times in the last 6 months and have been really impressed.
Their online ordering system is very easy, and i usually receive the shipment within 24-48 hours (within business hours).
Their rates are also better than the bank.
I find their service to be extremely convenient.
Best banking experience i've ever had!
Lorenzo helped me open a savings and checking account, as well as a credit card.
He was upfront and respectful, didn't pressure me into opening the most expensive account.
He was very friendly and made a lot of conversation through the process.
It was like being walked through by a family member.
Everyone in the building greets you with a smile and makes sure you're helped right away.
I guess the only downside is they're very friendly and like to make conversation with you.
Personally, i like that, but i can understand how it would be annoying if you're in a hurry.
It's a shame now that i'm moving to a different state, i would have loved making this my permanent bank.
What a great group to work with.
They go out of their way to be helpful.
I have been banking with wells fargo for over a year now.
Everytime i go in there, i receive good service.
Everyone is always polite.
However, today was by far my best experience with any bank.
Stacy the teller helped me today and she was absolutely amazing.
She did not make me feel the least bit uncomfortable, and she was super nice and genuine the entire time.
Thank you stacy for your amazing customer service.
For someone like me, being treated nice and dealing with people without judgment or harsh opinions is vary rare.
So i definitely appreciate it, and because of her service i will never bank with anyone else besides wells fargo.
I've been using this cu for almost 3 years now and i've always liked it.
I have a vehicle loan, a business account, and a regular account.
Katie just recently helped me set up my business account at this location and was very knowledgeable and helpful.
It was a pleasant and quick experience.
I'd bought a house before, but that was 2006 when rules were lax and i was a regular w2 employee.
Dan had us apply for a bank statement loan.
Dan fought the underwriters on our behalf a few times and won when common sense prevailed.
He always under promised and over delivered.
She should go and train those idiots at 19th ave & bethany home!
This place was great.
The rates were good and the lady behind the counter was quick and efficient.
I was in and out in a few minutes.
They had the currency i wanted and in the denominations also.
Other places only had larger bills and i needed small ones.
No hidden charges or fees.
I really like this bank, the staff is friendly and always take care of what i need.
I hate talking through the glass with bank tellers, and that is never a problem here.
This is the best banking experience i have had.
We now have our personal and business accounts with midfirst bank.
I have to say for a pawn shop it was a nice establishment.
Javier was a great help and they gave a fair price on my jewelry.
Location at scottsdale and earl.
Thank you very much
This bank of america location has the best staff.
Everyone is always eager to help and very nice.
I would recommend this center to everyone!
Thank you guys for all you do.
There's no place i would rather leave my valuables than at this facility.
Keep up the good service!
Surly i will recommend to anybody :)
He was also very patient with him.
This was my first experience of the southern hospitality!
I would go back to him with any additional needs!
Since i left wells fargo and i started banking with chase i have been so happy!
No hidden misc charges!
(wf was awful for 25.00 charges they couldn't explain! )
The customer service chase offers is amazing!
Especially at this particular location!
Today i went into chase for a replacement of a lost debit card .
I called in advance to see if there would be a wait time.
Jose told me over the phone i'd be helped right away!
I was in and out within 10 minutes with a temporary atm card.
I will visit this location as often as possible even if it's a few miles further then my neighborhood chase!
It's totally worth it!
After searching for a great engagement ring elsewhere (traditional retail jewelers and brokers) i was left unimpressed.
I wanted a beautiful stone but didn't care for the markup so it could 'traded in or traded up'.
Enter bancless loans-upscale/trendy stores that feel like a european boutique with a friendly and helpful staff in a relaxed environment.
Dan sherbondy, my loan officer is the very best!
He and his team are professional, courteous, patient and so very knowledgable.
Dan and kimberly answered all my questions and made me feel comfortable.
Dan had perfect timing when it came to securing/locking in my interest rate as interest rates soon rose.
I couldn't have been more pleased with his timing and my rate!
Dan, if you are reading this..... you are .... dan, the loan man las vegas!!!
I am so lucky and thankful to have had you represent me!
Thank you for helping me get a home, so i can have a new start in henderson.
I have been using nevada state bank for years and for the most part i get great service.
Ashlee the bank manager always takes care of me in this branch.
She is wonderful to work with.
Banks as everyone knows are difficult unless u have a lot of money.
In vegas us bank is the bank to bank with.
Phenomenal no pressure customer service.
Best rates and no fees on most of their accounts.
This one is inside smith's grocery store.
The manager patrick smith is super fast and helpful.
I have had the same a+ experience at every us bank i've been to.
Forget about bank of america - they're a joke here in vegas (see my review on two of their locations).
The customer service i receive here is spot on every time and the conversation that takes place is exceedingly pleasant.
There's no reason someone should be that nice, yet everyone here is wonderful!
Huntington has given me some problems as a bank in general, but there's nothing wrong with this branch at all.
Drive through is always clean, multiple atms.
Some you walk up too, others are drive through.
People are nice and then inside is very clean.
Not the best neighborhood, but you know, bank, duh.
Easy deposit and friendly staffs.
See rauh garcia if you need any help, he is a nice guy and will help you with any problem.
It's nice that they welcome you without pretension and often offer ways to safe you money for your transactions.
Drop in and you will always find friendly, knowledgeable and helpful staff.
Rowe and his team at southern fidelity mortgage were so easy to work with.
The refinance process was quick and painless.
This is by far the best insurance company i have ever had!
Prices are very reasonable and if i have questions they are always helpful!
...there is never anyone at this chase - morning, noon, night, weekday, or weekend.
That is why it is so encouraging find a company like bancless loans.
The location is quite secure and the showroom is uncluttered and features jewelry and coins for sale, as well.
When circumstances compel you to leverage your valuables for quick cash, i highly recommend bancless loans.
Fast and helpful service through out my time spent with sfm!
I highly recommend this company for their fast pace processing and determination to get the job done.
Thank you guys again!
Not sure what all the fuss and negative reviews are about or for.
Quick friendly and awesome service.
I've never waited long and they remember you if you come and see the same banker.
Can't ask for more from my bank.
The tellers are especially awesome!
Located inside on the right of vons right main entrance.
Good, fast and friendly service.
Also has an atm.
Staff was incredibly kind and polite, they helped me open a new account in a very efficient manner.
Being new to the area i am now confident that i found the best credit union in phoenix!
Consistently offers the best prices for currency exchange.
Fast, professional and easy, especially if you order online and have it mailed.
Definitely one of the better experiences i've had at a wells fargo and wouldn't mind stopping by again if necessary.
They were very helpful and friendly this is the bank i always like to go to.
Not as busy as another locations i've too.
Always great customer service.
Location is very convenient right off the 215/aliante.
Plenty of parking on both sides of the building.
And they have drive thru window for the tellar along with drive up atm.
Very helpful and patient.
Legitimate precious metals with competitive pricing.
I went in and spoke to jason/justin (sorry i forget which name) he has an awesome beard!
Hahah and he helped validate my parking for the hours i was stranded!
I wish i can give this location 100 millions stars!!
A merchant service company that strives to find solutions for business owners to make their businesses more profitable.
I never gave my insurance much thought until i actually needed to use it!
I like this bank because they are always professional and quick.
Chris is 100% on point.
He's very professional  and you can tell he loves what he does for a living.
Ramy is also on it every step of the way.
They constantly update you through the whole process and they top what other mortgage companies offer.
Definitely go with this team when your looking to purchase a home.
You won't regret it.
And they closed early on my new home.
I've been to this location numerous times after picking kids up from school.
I always get in and out quickly and with no problems!
This insurance agency rocks!
Joy has a team filled with a+ employees.
Specifically, i have been working with kasey for a couple of years now.
She answers emails so quickly and has really been great at advising me with different options.
Am so happy to continue doing business with these folks!
Julie hagan is truly amazing!
What would i do without her?
I suppose i would find another banking institution.
Julie hagan goes above and beyond.
Her name tag should read:  julie amazing hagan champion banker  thanks julie!
Twyla gray is the best!
She has helped us in a professional, proactive, honest and fast manner.
I highly recommend her.
I recently used their services and it was very convenient.
Ask questions using yelp message, they respond within hours.
They did the change quicly.
I had asked for about 1,500 euros.
No fees, similar exchange rate than others
Had been with state farm (bill johnson) for probably close to ten years (did change over this issue).
Have never filed an auto or home claim in over 20 years.
Had an issue that really involved "state farm corporate".
Bill stepped up to the plate and handled the issue himself.
State farm is there to make money for their shareholders, bill johnson is your good neighbor!
They greet every person that comes to the door.
Chad helped me out on getting a new gun today he was very polite and knowledgeable.
They also had the best prices around.
Best pawnshop in tempe hands down.
That's the kinda of relationship i am looking for in an insurance agent.
Then i meet nikki bott and her team.
The service they provide is above and beyond !
Ashley was super helpful and now i have a great gift for my little nephew's future.
Of all the big banks i've used in the past, none can compare with us bank in las vegas.
They treated me like an old friend when i came in to open a new account, in my new city.
They went out of their way to work with my illinois bank.
I come to this location almost everyday with work deposits and personal.
They never have me waiting long and great customer service.
I read other reviews for this bank and i have had nothing but great experiences.
I only come to this location!
This visit was like day and night.
I was greeted right away and only waited for an rm (chesaney) for about 5 mins.
I was in and out in no time.
I was really impressed with the customer service that this branch gave.
All of the staff were friendly and professional.
I will definitely come back to this branch for my banking needs.
My need to actually visit the bank is rare, as i have direct deposit and seldom use cash.
When i have visited this location, the inside always seems to be pretty busy.
But on friday they had all 4 desks open with tellers, so the line moved along quickly.
After 12 years in real estate.
Finally found a company that knows your name.
Cares about your business best customer service
This location has the best customer service!!!
I went in today 2/13/18 at 3:00 pm and yesmenia, a spanish lady, was very friendly and helpful.
She walked me outside and personally showed me how to deposit cash in the atm.
Samantha and the other woman working were also very helpful and friendly.
Everyone here is so nice!
The branch is extremely clean, even by bank standards, and even when they're busy it's relatively quiet.
They also have two drive up atms and one walk up atm as well.
Joy estes state farm agency in scottsdale is one of the best insurance agents you could ask for.
From insurance to financial advising, their team is very knowledgeable and helpful.
Bonus-the place looks awesome, such a professional but fun atmosphere!
Dropped by to grab some cash for a trip on monday.
They have me my tens and fives,quickly.
Carmi heard i was leaving the country and offered to set my country codes on the spot.
Whether my issue is big or small they can fix it.
Even if its a flurry of deposits they are so nice and quick.
I love this branch
Diana is the best!
I was in complete panic mode and diana made the process so much better.
I was completely calm and felt 100% sure that she was going to help me fix the issue.
Not a good day but diana for sure made it easier.
Opened a business checking account.
Humberto yee flores, jr has taken great care of me.
Deposited a check on friday where they were going to hold the funds for 3 days.
Humberto call the issuing bank and verified funds to have the proceeds released immediately.
Catherine flockton is the most amazing member service specialist ever ever ever!!!
She went above and beyond in getting me my check on time.
She made it her business to know me and know my business.
This place is highly recommend in my book.
Messaged over yelp, quick response and good customer service.
Great customer service and the wait is not to long.
Advise to go midmorning or late afternoon.
These people are always very helpful and always friendly.
I have never had any problems that they can't solve.
Very happy with my decision to switch to them.
The rate was the best in my area and they had the amount i was looking for on hand.
Rate was about 0.5% better than the banks.
Usually during the mornings it's not that busy.
There's usually 2 teller and couple of offices with people in them.
Very quiet most of the time.
Every time i visit they are very friendly and personable.
Customer service is a big plus for me here.
I don't have any account with them so i'm not too sure about how their products are.
Branch is clean and neat.
Great customer service... and even better rates on our truck payment....
Steve's office staff was friendly, accommodating and went above and beyond with some of the requests we had.
They were able to transfer everything from ca and get us up and running here in il in no time.
Super impressed with the professionalism but also with the warmness.
You won't feel like a number here.
Rusty was absolutely top notch!
We closed escrow in less than 30 days - during the holidays!
Thanks to rusty's professionalism, knowledge and experience we will be in our new home for christmas.
Can't thank him enough.
He is very easy to work with.
He didn't go back and forth like other lenders asking for a page a day.
Very organized manner of running business which made the whole process run very smoothly.
We've been through 3 purchases now, and about 4 refis and none ever ran this smoothly.
Will definitely come back to rusty if i purchase or refi again.
The staff is very helpful and courteous.
Other than that, it is a very nice bank!
The parking is ample and it is convenient.
They give you and everyone personalized service that you just don't get anywhere else.
I feel like they are all my friends and family.
Investing in this company has worked out for me, my daughter, and two sons.
We have been with them for over 30 years.
I highly recommend this banking institution to all of you and your family members.
I contacted blue brick financial after hearing their radio spot on 92.3 ktar.
At the time i was in process of a refinance with another lender that wasn't going very well.
They were friendly, professional, and provided feedback and communication almost as fast as i ask questions or provided information.
I would highly recommend blue brick financial with no hesitation.
I will use them again when the opportunity presents itself.
The chase representatives (every single one of them) at this location are very personable, professional, warm and extremely helpful.
I greatly appreciate this branch does not have the bulletproof glass-period.
I won't bother going anywhere else.
Been here a couple times and never had a problem.
Very nice banking center and the staff is great!
He helped me change my address over and things when i first moved here.
Really funny and polite man.
Next to the fwy !!
Great staff and friendly!!
I love going to this wells fargo branch because of the amazing, kind, trustworthy staff.
The manager, jesse obispo, is welcoming, knowledgeable, and always available to help with any needs i might have.
His staff is a clear reflection of him...they follow his lead in always putting the customer first.
What a great experience every time i walk through the door!
I am so glad my mom referred me to truwest.
From the tempe office to scottsdale to phoenix they are consistent with their great customer service.
They gave me a great deal on my auto loan and took care of everything for me.
So far i have had nothing but a positive experience with truwest and am glad i discovered them!
I would recommend them if you're looking for better banking or even an auto loan.
They are a great credit union and have been around for a long time here in arizona.
I've been with most of the big banks and i can't say that i regret leaving them at all.
Chase's response was that there was nothing they could do to stop it.
I couldn't get the hell out of dodge quick enough, and transferred my business banking to midfirst.
Only a few months later, my wife transferred over our family accounts as well.
The staff is friendly, it almost feels like my own personal bank the way you get greeted.
I am so happy i found this office!
I get the best service and adam is always available when i need him.
It's so refreshing to have an insurance agent that truly cares.
The service was great and the floor space wasn't ghetto at all!
The banker even suggested services for me that i would benefit from.
Kari phillips was my loan officer and she was fantastic.
Never had one issue and she always returned my emails and phone calls promptly.
Always fast & friendly!
Their customer service is top-notch and they get you in and out in a heartbeat.
I've gone a few times on my lunchbreaks from work and have received nothing short of awesome service each time.
Their tellers are always helpful, happy, and even crack a joke or two time and again.
Thank you for the great service, bbva compass!
Keep up the awesome work!
Awesome service, extremely nice people!
Very clean and organized, will highly recommend to others!
Very refreshing to be treated well under the circumstances of borrowing against jewelry!
You don't have to be ukrainian to use buduchnist, but it helps.
They support local ukrainian organizations and schools, incidentally.
Came in , in need of assistance was pretty fast .
Nice guy thank you for your help josh.
I went to interchange currency exchange to get gbp for my trip to london.
I talked to customer service - they said it was because knightsbridge fx has a lower rate for non-cash (i.e.
Bank to bank) transfers; not for cash-to-cash transfers.
Would likely go again.
They kindly also provided me with a mix of 50s/20s/10s/5s for ease of convenience while travelling.
This us bank location is one of my favorite location of all.
The staff always greets you and always smiles.
Since i always come to this location, they actually know my name.
Plus, the line is always short and probably wait about 3 minutes or less.
I would recommend coming to this location.
I can't imagine why anyone in boulder city would choose to conduct their banking anywhere else?
The dam credit union is so very civic minded and has amazing rates for their members.
Staff is friendly and one may always see neighbors and friends when you're inside as well as outside the lobby.
It's a community minded facility which has been an integral part of our loving living in boulder city.
Great hours, great services, great location,  24 hour grace period, hassle free checking, no hidden fees.
Plan on waiting 15 mins minimum in the lobby or drive through on saturday.
The staff was helpful and friendly.
Inside is beauuutiful, clean and modern.
Drive-through atms     probably because it just opened, it has been quite empty the two times i've been here.
Got helped right away.
Good service, drive through and in door lines move quickly.
They gave me a better rate than the bank would, also better than the place in the eaton center.
They even had costa rican currency in stock, which a standard bank requires ordering in advance.
Staff have been friendly even when i get overly specific regarding the denominations of bills i'm looking for.
Reviewer #9  my first time traveling to arizona!!!
Now that we got that out of the way!
Things to do: * grand canyon (my favorite part of my trip!)
Please don't come to az without doing this!
Because in california that is definitely hard to find out here!
* social tap (perfect for nightlife and where else can you get a great bar and food joint?
* dillons kc bbq * majerle's sports grill  shopping: * tons of boutique stores!
(thank me later) have a wonderful time in az because i sure did!
Everyone is nice and the weather (although it's hot) it's a great place to be!
Until next time arizona!
They have been  my bank for many years.
Wells fargo has always been awesome with me and my accounts and questions i have.
Occasionally, i find myself inside a branch and this particular branch definitely made it a good experience.
As soon as i walk in the door, i was greeted by a sweet staff member.
This branch is conspicuously newer and the walls are still slightly out gasing the fresh paint smell.
There was no line and i was immediately served by one of the tellers.
Easy transaction, teller was very skilled and fast.
Twyla at crosscountry is undoubtedly one of the best in the business.
I went to her needing to fund an investment property purchase that happened to be a short sale.
I was so glad to have found twyla.
Pretty impressive as all the back and forth document requests can eat up a lot of time.
I literally could have closed in over two weeks but i was waiting for a good time to lock rates.
We ended up closing in 3 weeks!
They also have very competitive rates and fees.
We went to apply for a car loan five days ago.
The teller encouraged us to apply online or by telephone.
So we went home and did just that.
What a fantastic service!
We were approved within minutes.
So we went in this morning (saturday) and sheila took very good care of us.
Thank  you for the fantastic service!
Highly recommend dustin as your go to teller !
He is very personable and always gets the job done fast !
He deserves a raise !
Ive gone through a few hardships over the years.
The people here always make me feel like i'm an important person, especialy rosie.
No matter when i call her.
She always gets back to me right away.
Rosie will always go above and beyond for you.
After researching many mortgage companies i came across rusty froats reviews and was really impressed.
We used him for our mortgage loan.
He was very knowledgeable and got things done rapidly.
We are self-employed and our scenario was a little more complicated so we wanted to use someone who was experienced.
There were no delays nor issues everything was executed as planned.
We highly recommend rusty for any loan needs he is very honest, hard-worker and most importantly he gets things done.
What an amazing experience!
The tellers were kind, willing to help, and fun to chat with.
I strongly advice this branch to any chase customer!
Thank you to the tellers who helped today, you were tremendous!
We checked in and the lady at the front greeted us with a smile and a positive attitude.
The branch was pretty vacant when we got there too but quickly got busier.
We had a bit of a wait (15-20 minutes) but we had a really pleasant experience with ling.
She was friendly, helpful, and informative.
Hopefully, other people will be able to have a positive experience like we did.
Cecil made the loan process a breeze!
The special they have on personal loans at 7.9% can really not be beat.
That is what brought me in after being referred to them for a personal loan.
The customer service couldn't have been better!
I appreciate that the staff is personable but professional and even laughed at my stupid jokes.
:p   i would refer my family and friends.
Went in to handle a couple of things and was greeted with exceptional customer service .
Very friendly and quick .
Banker joe , i believe, was professional and helpful .
Been a customer since 2015 i love this location .
I never had a problem with this location .
The employee are very nice and willing to help.
Fast and easy, friendly customer service.
Truwest life-hack: the mornings tend to be slower traffic in the bank.
I'd recommend this bank to any family and friend.
Convenient off the 202 free way between phoenix and tempe.
I've been a member for almost 5 years now and have only good things to say about truwest!
It's almost always better to go with a credit union over a bank, and truwest is why.
I haven't had a single unpleasent interaction here.
Great experience this morning.
Came down here with my fiancé and real estate agent, to sign paperwork for our new home.
Temperature controlled room, they even offered water and coffee upon walking in.
After we were finnished they had fresh baked cookies on the counter.
What a pleasant experience here!
I've always recieved amazing customer service from chase, but this location topped the cake!!
Upon entering, i was greeted by an older lady with a warm & friendly welcome.
She signed me in & while i waited, offered water & conversation.
This is a really cool feature, but made me concerned about staffing.
The real bonus was my banker, thuyvy, she was amazing!
Super nice & friendly, & i could tell she likes what she does.
Theres nothing i hate more than to go somewhere & all the employees are miserable!
Thanks ladies for the stellar customer service!
Outstanding, amazing always excellent customer service!
I am so glad i found them and started doing business with them.
Joy, you and your team are exceptional thank you for all that you do!
A safety deposit box is a third the price that it is at a bank.
So if you are anywhere near them i would recommend them.
My favourite banking branch of all time.
All the staff i've met here are always incredibly friendly and helpful.
They never seem too busy to help you out or to just have a casual conversation.
Service is also very prompt whether you're making a transaction, opening up an account, etc.
They also occasionally have small drives/sales by the front desk - e.g.
Book drives, book sales, scarf sales, etc.
This is the wells fargo branch i usually visit.
It's conveniently located across the street from costco so i can get gas a cash in a one, two swipe.
It can be slow.
Good service and knowledgeable staff if you need to see one of the bank representatives in the offices there.
Such a wonderful experience.
All truwest employees are extremely welcoming, friendly, and helpful.
Geoff, the branch manager, has really gone above and beyond in helping me.
He's also answered tons and tons and emails, very quickly at that.
Titlemax really help me out and go above and beyond when i'm bad spot great staff good people working there
As the 48th state to join the union, the landscape of this great land is varied and beautiful.
I love most everything about this credit union.
I just wish they would handle mortgages so i could move my mortgage to them.
They go above and beyond to help their customers.
Beau was helpful, patient, knowledgable, and a pleasure to work with.
They also provide amazing services and benefits.
I am so glad i opened an account with them!!
She worked tirelessly at all hours to make sure the transaction was complete quickly and painlessly on my part.
Sharon explained every step of the process and was always available to answer any questions.
Russell was very dependable and honest.
He was able to get me several options for a home loan.
If you're looking for an honest, hardworking individual you have found him.
Paul t. helped me and my little sister.
We were both amazed at how he took his time to help us.
I don't even bank with wells and i'm considering it now.
I am so happy with the service we have from this office!
Phones are answered promptly and friendly and messages are always returned in a very timely manner!
I can't express my gratitude  enough for the great service recieved!
I would and have referred all my friends and family!
Wes friedman is as responsive, professional, thorough and fast as anyone i've dealt with in the mortgage industry.
His willingness to go above and beyond made all the difference in the world.
This location has best best customer service!!
They really help me out in time of need.
Also there's options so can work with you i do recommend this location if you looking for title loan,
He's on top of his game.
Closes fast and on time.
No need to search elsewhere!
Fees are fair and he's all about saving his clients money.
Just got back from a roadtrip through the state of arizona.
I stayed mostly near flagstaff and saw the ski resort.
I'm from louisiana so i don't see snow often and loved it.
I will say if you aren't used to high altitudes, be careful trekking up to snowbowl road.
It's at nearly 10,000 ft elevation and within about 30 minutes i was feeling light headed.
I also saw the grand canyon and man is it beautiful.
All in all, if you're thinking of taking a vacation out west i highly suggest arizona.
You won't be disappointed.
Very knowledgeable and friendly staff.
I was looking to purchase and was very pleased with the selection.
I will be back for sure.
Went in this morning to open an account with their 50/50 promo and katie was great!
I cannot believe that i have forgotten to write this review for as long as i have.
I went through wells fargo originally to get my home loan.
I kept looking and found nothing.
I then went to rusty after talking to a few friends that went to him and was approved for more.
I'm not one to ask for an irresponsible amount.
Nor would i live outside my means.
With rusty and my realtor, they were a one two punch that landed me a home.
Not only me, but everyone that has used them as a team.
I would highly suggest going to crosscountry and talking to rusty, because his patience with me speaks highly of him.
As a new customer to compass, i've been nothing but pleased with their services and their staff at this location.
The ladies who work here are always very friendly with a smile on their face.
Since opening the account, i've visited this location on several occasion and always greeted with a friendly smile.
I accidentally left my driver's license after making a deposit and they called me right away to let me know.
I've also stopped in when they first open and they are always there to greet me with a smile.
So far, this former wells fargo banker is quite pleased with compass!
Loyal customer and haven't had any problems with this bank
I opened my account about a year & a half ago.
When i was back on track, cristal r-soltero helped get another account up and going.
She had the best customer service i've experienced in a long time.
I felt so welcome.
No stress, straight to the point.
I actually had fun.
Thank you so much!
Love this bank and this location, which says a lot because i despise the big banking system in general.
It didn't need to because of its own responsible investing policies.
Now about this location...
I highly recommend the bank and location.
The staff here is awesome!
I know all of them, and when i go in, they are quick and very personable.
They all have such a great sense of humor, and we end up laughing together the whole time!
Makes my everyday deposit a super fun time!
I really miss the us bank over by my old place of residence.
It was small, but nice and new inside, with friendly bank tellers who actually remembered who i was.
Now that this us bank is closer than that other one, i come here more often.
This place is older, and not as nice.
But i can say one constant has been the teller situation.
I had already deposited my money, but we both just got wrapped up in conversation!
I mean, that hardly ever happens nowadays!
Not much parking out front, and the atm is outside.
It creeps me out at night when i have to stop here and take out money.
I always think i'm gonna get robbed.
But other than that, this place is pretty solid.
Went in friday september 9th.
Guy greeted me at the door and held it open for me.
Very active personnel at this location.
Easy to work with bank tellers.
They go the extra mile where most companies do not even care about you anymore.
I like the personal touch of a bottle of water or a cookie that they give you when your inside.
Paul mejia over heard my conversation with the teller and went above and behind my expectations!!!
He heard what happened when i was explaining everything and said sargon follow me i will take care of you!
(i didn't even ask him for help).
He got my charge waived and went out of his way to offer me a solution to my problem!
Because of that great customer service i went ahead and signed up for a credit card!
I recommend paul mejia to everyone!
Easily accessible, three drive up atms, no long lines.
Sounds like a win to me !
We are going to go ahead and keep this one short and sweet.
Did a quick little map search and of course this location came up with some not so awesome reviews.
No luck, both tellers on the counter were very friendly and cordial to all the customers.
I drew jey and his up optimistic attitude was quite enjoyable.
Why four not five stars you ask?
Great job today gentleman at the counter!
Ok, i came for my auto loan here with debbie.
She was so patient and kind.
She gave us her email and phone to be able to contact her with questions as well.
Loved every moment of this transaction!
What can i say about this bank?
The cashiers are nice.
The managers never fail to say hi to you, unless they are busy with a customer.
However, i hardly go inside as i have automatic deposit set up or, i use the a.t.m.
The only problem i have with this location is exactly that, it's location.
But, it is what it is.
Will usually do the trick.
But, i have never had any problems with this bank...
So, true story: i always think for some reason this location is on s. kings.
This results in me driving around and actually thinking, did they move the bank?
This branch is convenient if you're in the metropolitan/target area just outside of uptown.
I rarely go inside this location, but the few times i've been in here the workers are all really nice.
Granted, i go during off-peak hours, but it's never really busy or a long wait.
The atm is not a drive-thru, so you do have to get out of your car to use it.
I'm always super paranoid about this and try to only visit this atm during business hours.
I watch a lot of svu and i'm pretty sure it's convinced me that i'll be kidnapped one day.
Whoever runs their social media is pretty on point.
Brands, this is how you do it.
Coffee and cookies available at the door for the homeless.
Often you are homeless when u walk in, and a homeowner when u walk out.
Constant very responsive communications were conducted.
The guys are so cool and make me feel very safe and confident with leaving my valuables here.
I recommend everybody to the american guardian!
Came here and met with rusty.
Rusty was friendly and on point.
We discussed the needs and he was able to find a program for my friend.
I thought he was very professional and his company fee's were extrememly reasonable!
If and when the time comes and i want to buy a home again, i will come here.
There are a lot of shady brokers out there and rusty isn't one of them.
I'll post an update as to how it went but for now, i'm definitely a fan!
Always goes above and beyond her expections.
I've been going to  bdcu since i was a child.
Everyone is very friendly and helpful.
The loans process is much easier here fa anywhere i've ever dealt with.
Kay is the nicest woman ice ever met!
Please if you read other negative reviews don't listen to them they clearly are not a long time bc resident.
I joined truliant years ago primarily to obtain an car loan.
The process was simple and convenient.
The location is convenient - right off of 77 at tyvola.
Also, you can make deposits for other local credit u ions here which is nice.
They are based out of winston-salem, nc, so it is great to have them in the qc.
This branch of us bank is amazing.
I must say renee has been the best ever since we started coming to the branch.
Not too mention all the staff is amazing there and willing to help.
That is customer service to its finest.
They could of turned me away but she did not despite the timing of my visit.
Awesome place to bank at.
It was nice to actually have a person who took the time to listen and understand what was going on.
I have been coming to this bank for over 6 years and never experienced a problem and not helped.
Customer service is great and i don't have to stress when i come here.
Meridian may not be an underdog in the true sense but in the banking world they certainly are.
I popped in here to get a cheque certified.
When i got back he was wrapping everything up with his manager.
I was quickly out the door without any hassle.
Great friendly customer service provided even to someone who isn't a meridian customer.
This wells fargo location at decatur has provided great customer service to me and my family.
Easy to get in and out, often i am attended right away.
Today i was seen by amber, who was professional and squeezed me in prior to her next appointment.
In a timely manner she was able to assist me and her next customer without delay.
However, i had previous great experience with other employees as well.
The folks working in this branch are all great -- kind, helpful, courteous, and a pleasure to deal with.
This branch is highly recommended.
Other huntington bank branches vary widely in this respect.
The best moving experience!
We just moved from chicago to phoenix and have been state farm customers all our lives.
We originally contacted a different agent to transfer our accounts and didn't appreciate the lack of excitement for our business.
Quickly, we googled other agents and called joy's office.
Laurie barbash fortunately took our call and she wow'd us immediately.
She was caring, concerned, and eager to get to know us in the first few minutes of our call.
She made us feel so welcome and she was truly happy to bring us on board!
), but she reviewed our policies with us to assure us everything was accurate for our current needs.
Some things changed for the better!
Thank you so much joy for employing such a detail customer focused person like laurie in your business!
If nothing else, you gotta go see the office...i could get lost in there all day long!
If you have new insurance needs, changing needs, or just want to have your stuff reviewed...these guys are the best!
Thank you for welcoming us to the valley!
Samantha waldo assisted us today and did a marvelous job, love her professionalism.
Not to mention her great sense of humor.
Will definitely return for any banking needs.
We had our auto and home policies with dawn for many years until we moved out of state.
Dawn and everyone in her office provide great service.
Our accounts and claims were always handled quickly and professionally.
I love desert schools, but especially this location!
This place is the best bank i have ever been to in my entire life.
The people that work here are so friendly and helpful- i almost forgot i was at a bank.
They even let me bring my doggie in with me.
I have talked everybody i know into switching to this bank and they love it too!
Excellent customer service, immediate assistance as soon as i have walked in every time.
Offer free notary to anyone even if you don't have an account with wells fargo- awesome!
Handle name changes, account openings and notarizations so quickly!
I feel like home when i go to his office.
This state farm office is close to downtown henderson and they are the best.
I was very pleased with the service i received.
I have generally been pretty happy with us bank and was very satisfied with the extra time and attention.
A great credit union with good rates on loans.
They need to invest some money into making a better site for their customers.
My family and i have been with this bank and visited this branch for a decade now.
They remember you by name and are very helpful and understanding.
I would not trust another bank.
This is the first time i've had continuous pleasant experiences with my insurance agent.
Mark brandon always answers my emails and returns my phone calls promptly and the office staff is so friendly!
I had previous state farm insurance with another agent and it was always difficult to talk to him.
Other companies i've had have all been difficult to deal with but not mark brandon!
I feel like i'm taken care of with him and it gives me peace of mind!
This was my bank and it always depended on the time of day you went!
For the 3 hours 10am to 1pm, my wait was 20 minutes.
But,  it had plenty of employees who were very helpful and professional.
Any issue i had were only with some rude customers who held up the lines with complicated lengthy transactions.
I've been with state farm my entire adult life (a long time!)
And with joy estes for over 30 years.
You couldn't ask for a better, more helpful agent than joy and her wonderful staff.
They get an a ++ in customer service.
One of my favorite ones in this area.
They make sure your taken care of as much as they can.
I have used this particular huntington branch for over a decade now, its always been a pleasurable experience during visits.
Juan lopez knows his stuff and really helps you out.
Do not pass up an opportunity to speak to this guy.
He will get you going quickly with what works best for you!
Good service and did not wait long at all, tellers were friendly each time i visited.
I have been with truwest since i got my first job.
They are extremely nice and helpful at this location.
Ive never had any issues at all with them.
I'm not a fan of banks.
Haven't been for some time, however wells fargo was recommended to me because of the credit card they offer.
I started out by opening a checking account with them.
I did everything online.
I was even able to transfer the money from my credit union account to fund it.
Once the checking account was processed and open, i applied online for a credit card.
I received a letter that i was approved, and in a little over a week received my card.
A couple times i had to call them to ask a question.
Great customer service both times!
I've used the drive-thru at this location twice now.
Both times, very nice!
Short wait times (which i hope is the norm), and very courteous staff!
I still have my credit union account, but i'm a happy new bank customer!
I hope they continue to win me over!
I have been with this credit union for many many years through many name changes.
They are always very helpful and courteous.
I like the upgrades to the atm machines..no envelopes or deposit slips adding the cash deposit is awesome.
I missed that when i closed down my other checking account with a major bank 7 years ago.
However, having to deposit checks one deposit at a time is cumbersome and annoyed me and the people behind me.
This credit union has great rates and customer service.
Opened up a cd and had a great experience.
I plan to invest more and perhaps move my checking account here.
While they can be understaffed at time they do provide good customer service and are very helpful.
I've never had an issue banking here
This is the best bank i have worked with.
They will send you notices according to your security preferences that you set up.
The employees are very nice and courteous.
This will definitely be our go to branch!
I go to this bank as a merchant and every single person that works here is amazing!!!
I have been in here a few times.
I have always had a good experience prices are high on some things but i always negotiate.
Kyle dent is a great guy there and has always taken care of me.
There are a few girls who work here that are not too friendly but i don't think there still around.
Went in here the other day to straighten out some financial business.
She was very helpful and offered a good amount of information to get me back on track.
After everything was discussed she handed me her card, said to call her with any banking related questions.
So technically, i have like my own personal banker, i feel so grown and special!
Its chase, i would think they'd know this elementary math!
I'm a small business owner and i use huntington for both my personal account as well as my business account.
I have yet to experience anything bad with them.
I got the money within 6 weeks of signing up, it was awesome.
The bank itself is open later (i think til 7pm more nights) and it's open 7 days a week!
Every time i come in the customer service is excellent.
There's always nice, smiling people ready to help me, not a bunch of bored looking people who hate their job.
Whenever i have questions, i don't dread calling customer service for huntington.
So far, it's been an absoluttely great experience for both my small business account and my personal..
I had the pleasure of having lori at joy estes help me.
If you are considering using this company i would highly recommend them.
I cannot say enough nice things about her.
I like this location, they are very helpful.
It's considered to be one of canada's busiest td canada trust branches.
As such, you have to expect to wait for services.
Bottom line, waiting in line should be expected at this location.
Come prepared with all your identification too, because they will ask you.
Besides the long lines and wait times, the service is top notch and delivered with care.
I use nbaz and this branch specifically is awesome.
Thomas there is great!
He helped me out with getting a check cleared when i was in their tempe location.
The tempe bank put a hold on my deposit and told me some bs excuse for why.
I called thom at the double tree location in scottsdale, he cleared it up and funds were available immediately.
Twyla gray is the best: very professional, helpful, super efficient.
Helped immensely in our va refinancing needs--highly recommend twyla and crosscountry mortgage!
I appreciate your assistance and will continue to do business with this branch secondary to there exceptional customer service !
I'm surprised there are negative reviews.
We've been with desert schools for 18 years.
We've had savings accounts, car loans, etc.
My husband has direct deposit with work.
My daughter just opened her first bank account.
They have all kinds of safety features since she's under 18.
We have an account here with the pto from my kids school i've been on as well.
They have caught fraud way long before we noticed it and reimbursed every last penny and fee.
There are atms all over the valley and branches.
But i can drive down the street a few miles.
We've only had good experience with the employees, they are all very friendly, well groomed.
The branch we go to has been extensively remodeled and everything is new and nice.
Really i can't think of anything bad.
The website is great, very clear and easy to read.
They've updated it over time.
We've been with them for 18 years!!!
It's a great company to work with.
Got us taken care of and was so friendly about it.
We should have came to you first, we had to deal with an ugly experience at a dealership.
I would definitely recommend both the branch manager(sorry do not remember her name, brunette around 40) and daniella.
Thanks again sun west mesa
Composite review over a decade.
Look, this a branch of pnc.
All linked by computer.
Drive through lanes adequately staffed and pleasant.
Www banking has been perfect for me for a decade.
F8 and be there.
I love this wells fargo.
I mostly come here to cash/ deposit my checks.
Everyone here is extremely sweet, friendly, & well knowledgable.
Thank you for all the great customer service!
There are several compass bank around, but this branch is awesome.
Judy is very helpful.
She goes out of her way to help customer.
I've been dealing with this branch for 3 months now.
The service is consistantly good.
Very good about calling back and answer any question i have.
I switched from chase.
Chase is too big and don't care about you but how much you have in your account.
I've been here a handful of times now for my banking transactions.
I've never had to wait to be helped.
Employees are friendly and efficient.
The space is clean.
And the ac and cold water are a godsend in this stupid vegas summer heat.
And bonus point for the little lollipops at each teller station.
I'm docking one star because this location shares a parking lot with a bunch of other businesses, including a gym.
So finding a spot even towards the end of the row can be a pain.
But nevertheless, i'll continue to banking here if i am in the area.
I've been banking at truwest and still early 1990s and they've always treated me great.
I joined truliant a year or so ago after my other credit union decided to pull out of charlotte.
They have the usual options of accounts and they send out regular tips on how to manage your money.
They also have a decent online bill pay service and other online tools!
Credit unions don't charge the fees that banks charge because they are non-profit and here to serve you.
This branch is super convenient.
It is a full service location with 3 drive thrus, 1 drive up atm and an inside atm.
If you're looking for a change from banks or another credit union, check out truliant!
Super good deal $0.75 dvds!
Friendly service and a good movie selection.
You really cannot beat $.75 movies!
Right next to the railroad tracks and kyrene road
Good rates and good service.
I called ahead to confirm the rates (at that point in time) and my call was answered promptly.
I would definitely go back and have recommended this location to other friends.
Hey guys why is saturday closed!!?
I just want to state that your location rocks!!
You guys know who i am and i see you guys alway take care of me and my wife.
You will see us again.
I just got to vent we had a bad experience in a blue diamond location.
Anyway have a great day and see you guys again.
I have been a member of desert schools for over 10 years and have never been disappointed.
They just helped me secure a vehicle loan for a client and it went as smooth as can be..
Thanks paula clark for that excellent level of service.
Peter mattys performance mobility of phoenix
This is how i like a neighborhood bank to be.
Definitely beats bank of america.
The staff at this wells fargo branch are great!!!!!!!!
Friendly and very helpful.
They notarize no charge to customers!!!!!!
Thanks for the great service.
I am very pleased with the service i received at this branch.
Ms. melissa's professionalism and enthusiasm to help me so promptly exceeded my expectations.
This type of professionalism and commitment to the highest level of customer's satisfaction has to be acknowledged.
This chase bank is outstanding!
Their customer service is always very pleasant.
I have always been greeted at the entryway.
They have lots of employees so you really don't ever wait too long.
I think this may be the best banking location i have ever 'banked' with!
Oh and they have suckers :)
I love the management and staff at this branch.
However, they are no longer open on sunday.
One might ask themselves, will machines ever take over the world?
Honestly who knows or who cares.
I probably won't be around during the time it happens, if it happens.
I did come across one machine that made my day a little easier.
I'm not a big fan of banks.
I just feel as if i'm stuck in an assembly line.
Back to my review.
This boa has a convenient drive up atm machine.
Quick, simple and oh so very polite.
Whenever i'm in a rush.
I zoom right it and i'm done in less than a minute.
It's sad when a machine is faster, nicer and more efficient than the bank tellers inside.
I highly recommend mark brandon.
He is patient, accessible and an all around pleasure to work with.
Not only is he incredibly knowledgable, he also takes the time to explain.
I will definitely continue to recommend him to friends and family!
Love this credit union.
The loan process was super easy, and everyone was very friendly.
Josh explained the whole process and prepared us for each scenario.
The whole process was maybe two hours.
Definitely will come back for other banking needs!
Thank you josh for your stellar customer service, and the laughs.
Lynnette did a great job on my escrow.
She was really on top of things and got it done.
I am very pleased with the service and quality of the work performed.
Just left the ibew.
I've banked with them for years.
I wanted to thank leigh for her excellent customer service.
She was friendly professional thorough and very fast.
I would recommend ibew and all the services they offer.
Leigh qualified me to refinance my auto loan saving me thousands!!!!
Extremely respectful and nice.
They helped me a ton and got me out of a rough spot.
Anmar's service is fast and courteous.
Just had the worst customer service with b of a holes again.
Came to this location and people are friendly and smiling.
Can't wait to have enough time off to move all my accounts from b of turd to here
The staff here is just as friendly and always so helpful.
The information was communicated clearly and with a smile.
I feel confident in the policies i was recommend and decided on.
Thank you, joy (and a special shout-out to kasey estes who helped as well:)!
Go see her for your banking needs and you'll absolutely be satisfied!
I didn't even want to take cash out, just wanted a lower rate.
So blue brick was my last shot and after reading some negatives on them, i certainly had my doubts.
Now i can use this extra monthly savings to help pay down other debts.
To be stuck in a high interest mortgage with no way out, other than to sell, was very disheartening.
Julie and her team at blue brick made possible what others told me couldn't be done.
We are so appreciative!
No closing fees and competitive interest rates are also attractive.
Bill johnson is our state farm agent and has been since 2002 when we moved to surprise.
We have been state farm members since the 1960s as were our parents before us.
They are responsive to all inquiries.
We've had very few claims but all were handled efficiently by staff and company representatives.
I've only purchased auto and home through them but i highly recommend this agency of state farm.
Theresa the branch manager was very nice.
She help my nephew and i open up his first bank account.
She was very genuine and even help my nephew at the atm to activate his card.
Because of her genuine service i will only be visiting this branch.
Thank you for all your help theresa.
I do trust them to store my valuables!
Great customer service and very modern technology.
Always friendly and helpful.
I have savings and an auto loan here.
They do everything that they can to make things easy.
I may switch all accounts to omega.
This is my primary bank, since it's so close to my house and convenient.
I've always had decent service here.
It's a good location, and the tellers always help me out with whatever i need pretty fast!
The atm here is very efficient.
I've withdrawn some cash from here as well and the tellers were always polite.
Great example to what customer service should be all about.
In my opinion should be the continues core to retain happy  customers.
Great staff and really good quality products and always honest very clean store.
We are a team and i couldn't ask for a better teammate.
Quick and customer-service friendly.
Went through the drive through teller at almost closing time and they were still welcoming.
This is my favorite bank to go to.
Everyone in the staff is friendly, knowledgeable, accommodating and not pushy or fake.
Juanita is the manager and we adore her.
She is always helpful and happy to help.
I've never had an issue with any of the bankers or tellers.
They work fast and efficiently.
This branch is a lot faster than others nearby.
Very nice people here.
Come in and get a checking or savings account, or take out a personal loan.
I've done a lot of banking here.
Honestly, if you're banking somewhere else, you're probably also high on crack.
Don't be high on crack.
Do your banking here.
Easy to work with.
They returned my call promptly and gave me the anticipated closing costs.
On friday, 5/5/2017: lamarr young answered my questions and explained the product clearly.
She is friendly and professional.
I have been banking with boa for a long time.
I had to come to this bank center to get money out.
The manager was a vary big help.
I do belgrave thus bank is above average.
Nice tellers and a go out of the way managers.
Come here a few times,  rates are really good.
This place has one of best rates when coming to exchanging currency.
One of employees name josephine was super helpful and was happy to serve me.
Definitely will come again.
My checking account and savings account are through them.
They're doing all right for me, as far as big, corporatized banks go.
This one is small, located next to albertsons and cvs pharmacy.
The ones that do recognize me are always very nice and chit-chatty.
They also tend to welcome you when you walk in and bid you a farewell when you leave.
It's pretty nice of them and it's a nice change from hearing about how bad banks are.
At least the employees at the banks can make you feel happy about coming somewhere to put your monies!
My favorite financial institution by far!!
I switched to tfcu in february of 2017.
I've used 3 branches for my financial needs.
All three were, police, courteous, knowledge, and professional in every business transaction.
I've recommended them to four of my closest friends, and they are all very pleased.
I'm very elated to be a member, and i'm always treated like a member.
I've always had exceptional service at tfcu.
I also bought a vehicle in march 2018,  using cuabs, their credit union auto buying service.
I live at least 2 1/2 hours from their cuabs, in winston salem.
The customer service has been top-notch!!!
Thank you, tfcu, for insuring your customer's are satisfied!!
Jason michel and crosscountry inc. delivered.
We closed escrow a day or two early and that's the bottom line.
The process was particularly challenging because it was during the holidays and we were temporarily out of state.
Jason is personable, professional, and knowledgeable.
He explained everything in detail as needed--a great communicator.
The people here are so helpful and kind.
There's no long lines and no exasperating wait.
Tenny was rock solid.
Everyone did a great job handling my mortgage.
I highly recommend crosscountry mortgage.

It's the corner building with the recognizable digital clock/temperature outside.
It's the old huntington building.
Convenient location you can walk to from the playhouse sq area in less than 10 minutes.
It's also located close to a healthline stop and an e-line trolley stop.
There is an outdoor walk up atm with no awning over it.
Inside you have your typical bank - tellers and personal bankers.
The tellers are friendly, yelling hello to you the moment you step out of the revolving door.
When i was there most recently the three tellers were efficiently handling the line and the wait was minimal.
I appreciate downtown businesses that move with efficiency mid-day and this is one of them.
I was at this location to close out my wells fargo account.
Wells was always good to me, but merging with the wife!
They were fast, kind and i was out within 10min.
Now nearing 50 we both find it crucial to look for new and careful ways to invest.
The gentleman who helped us was keith jensen.
He was polite upon our unannounced arrival, and sat with us for over an hour.
His consideration for our efforts and his discerning advise provided new avenues for our family's future wealth.
All of which we have only thanks to offer charles schwab for providing an excellent advisor!!
Jason is very helpful and informative.
Always available to help with questions.
Have called with car issues a couple times and he quickly gives me the information needed.
I wouldn't go anywhere else.
These guys took a lot of time to explain the process to me, and i had a lot of questions.
I wouldn't recommend anyone else because these guys have more knowledge and don't rush through things to get a "sale".
And they actually answer the phone and call their customers back!
4.5/5 great branch, friendly, very helpful knowledgable, caring.
Have sat with me and walked through varying scenarios which would otherwise lead to frustration and provided streamline guidance.
Best atms ever plus their notary always happens to be available
This branch sits on a very busy intersections on scottsdale rd.
There's only 1 atm on-site and no drive-thru atm at all which i think they really need improvement on.
But overall service was excellent.
If you need anything, go see joe, he'll gladly help you out.
Roger and jessica made sure all my questions were answered.
Carrie who worked with the underwriters was on top of everything.
Usually something goes wrong or lots of last minute panic from underwriter side or needing updated documents last minute.
Great experience and great rate/package.
I decided to give them a try.
I would have to agree that lesley, myrna and kyle have been absolutely wonderful to work with.
Looking forward to doing more business with them.
Also, bank of arizona has atm's in every qt gas station!
Henrietta is an awesome personal banker at america first.
She set up my account with a debit card, checking, savings and a temporary card in under a half hour.
Super quick but super personable, knowledgeable and friendly.
She exemplifies customer service and professionalism.
Thanks so much for making this a great experience.
Then they also direct you to the right elevators.
Although the water from the drinking fountain tasted a bit strange.
The people at huntington bank go out of their way to help.
If i need help getting forms signed, they are only a phone call away.
First class service, the best pricing(who doesn't like unlimited processing for only $39.99) and i love my clover device.
I highly recommend micamp to anyone looking for an affordable, great point of sale.
This agency is all about service!
I highly recommend them for anyone looking for a local agent!
Very pleased with the services we receive from bmo harris bank.
We love our primary banker and the entire team is proactively helpful in a variety of ways.
Their international services are particularly helpful for my business and most of the companies i work with.
His office provides fast, prompt, accurate, and friendly customer service.
We just purchased a home and used southern fidelity mortgage.
Our senior loan officer was fiona grant.
I couldn't say enough of great things about her and the overall experience.
I would definitely use fiona and southern fidelity again and would highly recommend their services.
Very consultative approach and they really know their stuff.
I've been here my whole life, and i've never had an experience as great as this.
From the one forest to the low hot desert arizona is the place to be.
This story goes like this.
The rep was busy and he's the only one who can help.
I don't mind waiting but 3hrs to open a account is crazy peeps.
Didn't know you need to schedule banking transactions.
He wasn't rude but made me feel like i had not been part of civilization.
So i left thinking wow business must be good at this branch.
Went down the street to another chase, waited a bit and received assistance from amanda moffitt.
She was truly professional, knowledgable, but mostly kind.
This rep knows customer service!
I just might transition my other accounts.
Give amanda a nice bonus won't you.
So chase maybe it's time to retrain some of your staff and possibly add staff on saturday's.
I give amanda 4 stars!
I always use this drive thru for my banking and never have any problems.
Quick service and friendly staff
The bank manager, eslam, was extremely helpful with some docs i had to have notarized.
The other professionals there were very welcoming.
Seems like a very well run branch.
Out of the all bank of americas this one stands out!
Open til 6 on fridays, they have a drive-thru, everyone inside is friendly.
I'll drive out of my way to make my deposits here.
There are several bofas i have boycotted, but here i now support.
Still not a big fan of all the banking fees they hit me with, but the staffs great.
Spoke with matteo he was amazing and a great attitude.
He solved my problem in minutes.
Quick atm, love the central location.
And close to chase and wells fargo bank.
Get all bills and banking done at once.
Even with a long line they get you in and out.
Able to answer questions about loans.
Or give you a number if the woman who handles it isn't there.
They follow up and get everything answered.
I've been a happy member since 1990!
Other credit unions even recognize that bdcu is the best!
Whenever at this branch, come see raul he has initiative and helps you on the spot.
I love bank of america.
My daughter and i have banked with other banks and have had multiple problems.
Since we have been with boa (2 yrs) we are extremely happy with our banking services.
Lori is all about customer service, management seems nice.
I normally dislike chase as an institution, but this location is an exception to the rule.
Like this bank location.
I'm in the bright light in what feels as a safe secure place.
I can get my grocery shopping and bank needs done.
Very easy to kill two birds with one stone.
The people seem nice.
I've only dealt with them once and it was when i opened a savings account for my daughter.
They also give my daughter a huge horse as a thank you gift.
She was in heaven.
When i looked up the brand i saw it was a 40 dollar stuffed animal.
Figured it would be less since it was free.
Or if i have to withdraw more than the daily balance allowed.
Even with those few transactions i rarely encounter a line anymore.
I don't have any set days and maybe it is busier on a monday or friday?
In any case, the parking lot is empty nowadays, and there might be 2 tellers on duty.
Who by the way are friendly and efficient.
Gone are the days when you see the same tellers who know you by face and name.
I hope this is not a sign of the times where this branch may close due to low traffic.
Gateway title agency is the way to go!
With absolutely no knowledge of how to sell a home i was referred to gateway title by a friend.
It was the best advice i ever got!
They explained and gave me everything i needed including great support.
Rachel and her staff are wonderful!
You cannot go wrong with gateway!
Thank you all once again.
I rarely go into this branch and i don't know why.
You might consider it more of a business branch and that is fine with me!
I went in on a friday afternoon near to closing.
There were no lines of people and things were going at a brisk pace.
The employees are always very helpful.
Now that i think of it, it has never been overly busing-line wise-anytime i have been in there.
I just wrote a review on my experience with a particularly strange individual i ran into at another business setting.
It's such a pleasure to say something nice instead!
If i had gone into in this branch more, i'd probably have give it five stars.
Really nice and smooth transaction for car loans!
These guys were terrific!
The entire deal took less than 14 days.
This chase has the best customer service!
Everyone was accommodating as i waited no much longer than 5 minutes for my appointment.
Jared was informative & fun to converse with.
This location is smaller than most, but it has the best feng shui in my opinion.
One little thing that could be an issue is the parking lot.
Joy was my state farm agent for years before i moved to california.
No upselling products here.
She also helped me with banking and investment accounts.
Cannot say enough positive things about joy and her office.
I've been to phoenix a half dozen times, though only twice since i've been yelping.
Yes, the grand canyon is absolutely incredible.
A world wonder in fact and you should not miss it.
Please understand that it's not exactly close to phoenix.
But there's more to the state than the canyon.
The lowell observatory in flagstaff was where pluto was discovered.
The pima boneyard is where old aircraft go when they're not needed any more.
Monument valley, on the arizona/utah border.
The hoover dam, on the arizona/nevada border.
Sedona, havasu falls, petrified forest.
And i've only been to *some* of those places.
Writing this list has me thinking that i need to be back in arizona.
A lot of experience with banks in many cities, east to west coast.)
I am absolutely stunned at some of the negative reviews.
I wonder, do they have the right branch?
Whatever, here's my view.
Customer since september 2015.
I have never walked into this branch without someone greeting me.
You don't get that at chase and you most certainly do not get that at bank of america.
The longest i have ever waited on line was perhaps four minutes.
The tellers are efficient, pleasant, personable and businesslike, yet not stuffy.
They know their stuff, and can accommodate quickly.
Even on the exit they have someone there to wish you well and say goodbye.
I realize it's a bank, but it's simply a nice place to visit.
The branch also maintains extended hours and is open on saturday.
I imagine if you're not purposely looking for a problem, you won't find one at this wells fargo branch.
I found that wells fargo bank seemed to be best for me and my needs.
His name is joseph giustino.
It seems as if now a days banks are in love with charging their customers fees, fees, fees!
With the account that i had opened, there are no monthly maintenance fees.
This is very refreshing, being that the fcu that i have back in honolulu has none, as well.
What in the world?!
Thank you, wells fargo!
Found my dream car at one of their credit union sales.
When they have their car sale it's the best way to buy a car.
Save ur money :) the staff at boa are always happy to see you!
No matter what the reason that you stop in.
They have a app that can help you also.
Recently joined this bank chain at the sahara-decatur location.
But every time i go (and i go at off-peak hours!)
There's a considerable wait, especially to work with a banker.
But this location is sneaky, i didn't even notice it in this plaza until i pulled it up online.
It's convenient to my work, so i stopped in to make a deposit- and there was no line, at all.
Their staff is super friendly and helpful.
Two thumbs up, this is now my preferred location.
Actually i have no words to express how rusty helped me for the home loan process!
I am an self-employed performer that been in this situation for last 10 years!
Just recently moved to vegas and plan to purchase a place that i can call home.
I called so many different banks and mortgage broker for loan.
On the phone they actually simply said that to me over the phone "don't waste both our time".
I almost give up keep finding for loan until i found rusty on yelp.
I thought just give another shot to hear the same answer over again......!
And i called and told rusty my situation and he got me the answer is yes.
I can do it for you!
He helped me closed a house with in just two weeks from i placed an offer.
Even my realtor she couldn't believed it went so fast and smooth.
Not even cash offer could closed that fast.....!
What can i say about that.
I am so happy and lucky that i found him that he helped got my first home with this situation!
Thank you so much rusty!
There's not enough words to describe the beauty of the grand canyon.
Had an amazing time
Friendly staff, always a pleasure to go here and do my banking.
Personal bankers are always available.
I never have to wait long, if you even have to wait.
I usually can walk right up to the teller.
I left the big banks and my only regret is that i didn't do it sooner.
Cold, heartless and greedy!
Their staff is friendly and extremely helpful.
I receive personal attention that i never got from the big banks.
Definitely a rare thing to see.
See for your self.
I will recommend rusty to anybody.
These people are awesome!
Perhaps the other reviewers were turned-off by the small town feel of this credit union.
To me, they are more like the "cheers" bar "where everybody knows your name!"
We are refinancing (i prefer to call it "firing' bank of america.)
And the process couldn't have been easier!
Kim, loan consultant, has made the process simple and seamless.
Also, we went to a info seminar on social security and it was a gas!
The info was great but the food (forge social house) was even better!
I'd review forge social house (5 stars) but couldn't find them on yelp.
Banking at the boulder dam credit union truly is a "wonderful life!"
From my mortgage to my 401k these folks do a fine job and are rarely busy or delayed.
I'm new to wells fargo so i was looking for a branch that i could count on.
This one was super clean and quick...and it was a friday, too!
Everyone was very friendly and eager to help.
It'll definitely be my "go-to" location.
This place is awesome.
Great dvds for only a dollar and video games in good condition for 5 bucks each.
This is my second time coming here.
Last time i bought a ton of movies.
I guess this time was video games time.
The workers are nice and quick.
The store is small but there's a lot in that little space somehow.
The games i got were fallout 3,  bulletstorm, tekken 5,  soul calibur v and town raider underworld.
I'll come back in another week or two to see what other games they'll have.
One of my favorite pawn shops.
This place is way cheaper than gamestop for video games.
I loved the staff at this location and was sad to see it close a few months ago.
We've been to the petrified forest it is amazing!
To see how the trees turned to stone and fell over and broke like glass!
We saw the painted desert the grand canyon and carlsbad caverns and several indian ruins!
I just finished signing loan documents this morning with leilani.
I was referred to kari's team by my real estate team and could not be happier!
I have a lot of questions and i like to get advice from the experts in any given field.
The person i worked the closest with was leilani and she was amazing!!
Kari's whole team was amazing!
They put up with my constant calls, emails, even texting me when i asked for late day updates.
My 30 day escrow close date was supposed to be today 6/10/16....and i signed the documents this morning at 8am.
I received a phone call from kari and leilani at 10:30am telling me that funding was already done!
Now we are waiting on the county to record and i will get the keys to my house tonight!!
I am in shock as to how quick this was, how painless this was and how amazing these people are!
I can't thank kari and her team, especially leilani, enough!
Pretty spacious for the inside despite looking a bit dated.
Still, staff is friendly and they are knowledgeable in the products and service that they provide.
This is my normal branch that i bank at - as closest to my house.
Have been here more times than i have checked in --- trust me!
The people are what make this branch stand out.
Always friendly and willing to help.
They remember my name and my preferences - know how to get me in and out fast.
Note: this branch is inside the fry's grocery store.
Just a great atmosphere, everyone is cheerful and welcoming.
I truly appreciate banking somewhere where the staff doesn't treat you like a number
I visited this establishment with very low expectations, which were due to the bad rated reviews...and was pleasantly surprised.
Not only were they incredibly efficient, they were extremely helpful.
While there, a man was haggling a $30 tool down to $5.
Even though it was listed for $8.
People need to understand that it is a business and you can't always have your way.
If you're upset because you didn't get paid your properties total value, then go somewhere else, there are other options.
I reinstalled yelp just so i can give an honest review.
I have been banking here since i moved and they are always so friendly and helpful.
Friendly and helpful staff and great service.
I would recommend them over any of the big banking institutions!
Given his fair rates i was able to initiate and deliver on proposals and repay capital with very profitable margins.
Definitely recommend gravity for any funding needs in the phoenix area.
I went to this bank location today to get a check reissued and the staff was very friendly and effective.
I definitely recommend this branch to anyone who banks with wells fargo.
Really nice guys here that always help me out quickly!
I've been here several times and it never ceases to amaze my how easy it is to get some help.
Manuel is super nice and very efficient and i never have had a bad experience here.
I have been with america first credit union since 1993 i believe they were network credit union back then.
A-1 operation.i wish i could give them 10 no 1000 stars.
They're making me happier than b of a as of late.
We'll have to see how it goes.
Not too long of lines so that's awesome.
I highly recommend this money exchange  service location in downtown toronto to any tourist.
The clerk was fast and knowledgable and was honest on top of it which matters a lot.
I was really satisfied with their service since all the sings were posted clearly and easy to read.
I've been in the industry for 30 years and i strive to be a consummate professional.
It's a pleasure working with national title and their team!
Micamp has helped me with my business's credit card processing needs.
They are great with helping find that right merchant service solution and are affordable.
Fantastic customer service at the windows.
Tellers are pleasant polite and most importantly efficient.
Went in twice and was remembered by name.
I have banked with them for over a year and they are great.
I like the checking account they offer and they have good rates on loans.
How can you not give this bank a 5-star?
It opens on sunday, most banks don't.
It extend their business hours mondays thru fridays, most banks don't.
Seriously, do try them first before you give a bad review.
I don't understand all the negative reviews.
I had a great experience!
I wasn't up for the bank due to being incredibly sleep deprived, but everyone was so friendly.
Isaac helped us out, and he was very courteous and knowledgeable.
We were in and out of there pretty quickly.
We were also greeted with smiles and we had the door held for us upon arrival.
Been banking here for years.
I really love this bank.
Ive done 2 car lones with them and have gotten great interest rates.
Even with my not so good credit score from the past.
I've been with them for over 10 years, and watched the changes.
I like the progress they are making for a small cu.
I've always been treated well, and the handle the one-offs beautifully.
I trust them with my money and financing.
Best branch that i have had the pleasure to do business with.
Zach is a great guy to deal with.
Friendly, courteous, and helpful.
He actually does his job properly.
If you need to do any business with the bank of america, i would recommend this branch.
I've been a customer for 30 years and it was actually refreshing to do business with this location.
I never have to wait as long as i do in other b of a branches.
Very friendly and helpful staff.
Flexible and convenient hours.
Open every day of the week until 7 pm and even have weekend hours.
My first time here.
Very friendly and seemingly a relationship-based staff as they interacted with customers.
Miguel hernandez is absolutely amazing!
Extremely knowledgeable, great customer service, super friendly.
These guys are really friendly,  down to earth,  and very helpful.
I have all my accounts here and i always have fast and efficient results with them.
I love that they know me and call me by my first name :)
Suzie drinkwine at the lake mead is the best.
She helped me refinance my cars and saved me  a ton of money.
I used to belong to sunwest before yelp and the internet existed.
Glad to see they are still around for me to become a member yet once again.
This was just the opposite!
Rusty was quick to answer questions and respond to requests.
He was helpful and honest about the loan process.
My husband and i both work on contracts and don't have regular jobs.
Our escrow closed early and we were in our house sooner than expected.
Even our realtor raves about rusty!
Amazing location where the staff treats you like an old friend just for being a member of their bank.
Will lewis went above and beyond to provide top notch service.
I cannot say how much joy means to our family.
She actually came you to my home for two hours to clean up a disaster.
She is my girl!
I would like to thank ms. marika jacyla for excellent service.
She is caring, helpful, efficient and i have no words to describe her positive attitudes towards clients.
I am a new client and i want to express my gratitude for her  efficient help, knowledge and encouragement .
Thank you from a bottom of my heart.
You represent your organization with pride and great experience.
It is a great pleasure to join buduchnist credit union.
The news hit me like a ton of bricks.
You're going to charge me $2 just for the privilege of accessing my own checking account?
For a full month, bofa didn't back down.
And other big banks soon followed suit saying they'd also look at charging debit usage fees for their customers.
Within days of bofa's announcement, i began looking into the move myself.
On the whole, the credit unions are structured very similarly to the banks except in terms of scale.
My biggest concern with joining a credit union was about access to my accounts.
I ended up choosing desert schools as my credit union of choice for a couple of reasons.
Additionally, desert schools is part of what is known as the credit union atm cooperative.
And the best part is desert schools will waive or reimburse any access fees associated with using these co-op locations.
In terms of the banking experience itself, i've had nothing but positive experiences with desert schools branches.
The staff at each branch i've gone to is friendly, efficient, and organized.
Small potatoes perhaps, but certainly an area where they could use improvement.
All things considered, the move to desert schools has been a positive one.
As long as that remains the case, i see myself as a desert schools customer for the long haul.
And desert schools if you're reading this, how about adding a downtown phoenix branch soon, eh?
They have always been good, professional and friendly.
I have been noticing they do have coffee and also offer water to customers.
They are also very prompt to greet customers as they come in through the door.
I am very sorry i do not remember any of the names but everyone here has been very helpful.
Today is another example of why i am glad to have mark.
We unexpectedly found a car we liked to replace another vehicle.
It was late in the day and we contacted mark to update our auto policy.
He went back to his office and in no time we had our new insurance papers.
Who knew you could review individual states on yelp?
It was a great joy to travel to this amazing state and see all it had to offer.
So much to see.
Well we explored parks.
Different places to eat.
Had the joy of going to   the beautiful grand canyon!
Go and watch the sun come up over the canyon.
And the sun go down later on.
It will take your breath away and sweep you away with the sheer magnificence of it.
Sedona is just as stunning.
You are surrounded by red rocks.
Try to eat in town maybe outside or at least somewhere with mountain views.
You may encounter a little town called two guns.
I think the population was four people when we went and we met two of them.
So we can say we met half the town!
The homes were so unique looking.
Did not love phoenix.
Sorry but there was alot of smog and it was to much of an urban sprawl for me.
We got lost a few times.
One thing i would advise: it can get hot in arizona and sometimes you cannot feel the heat.
It really isn't a humid heat like florida.
I wound up getting sunstroke which my wonderful friend called to my attention.
It really is a dry heat so be aware.
Loved the whole state though.
It is a stunning collage of glorious mountains, parks and stunning horizons.
I cannot imagine how cool it is to live there.
We had a great time and if you haven't been you need to go!
Desert schools is the best financial institution in the phoenix valley.
Their customer service is top notch and their friendly staff always makes me feel welcome.
Miguel and alina helped us out today and they were wonderful!
Love that they are open every day.
Hours are a little shorter on the weekends.
Friendly staff and some of them remember me by name.
For both personal and business banking, this is a great and fast branch.
In addition, they have a couple of notaries who do not charge any fees to wells fargo customers...what?
I have been dealing with these guys for years.
They have always been helpful and polite.
When i ran into a problem they helped me out better than i expected.
I highly recommend them!
I only come here for the atm.
It's in plain sight with ample room for others to wait in line.
The one thing that totally sucks is that it's only one machine.
Should someone need to do more than two transactions it can be a pia!
However, when i have had to be here after hours i feel safe and confident withdrawing cash.
The parking lot in front is a little difficult to maneuver when driving a large vehicle.
The spaces are too small or perhaps too many.
But, it's a busy bank and they have to live with the property design.
The place was packed due to the holiday rush.
The line was long and i can't ding them for the customer's lacking.
They were working pretty fast in trying to get people in and out.
The teller was efficient in getting my specific requests accomplished.
They have one the most helpful person...his name is kenny flores!
Wow he helped me get new bank cards.
I needed them that day and i got them thanks to him!
I got my plane tickets and i'm happy!
Thank you kenny for your help i truly appreciate a job well done!
I go hunting a ton.
Ok, i never do, to be honest.
What a beautiful old bank with a beautiful old building on top of it.
Not a lot of people actually bank here but the building itself is definitely worthy of the star rating.
A relic from old cleveland, and a beautiful one at that.
Let's cut to the chase.
Pretty generic dark grey building hovering over the skyline of cleveland ohio.
Also i'll be honest.
I have a premium investment account with chase and i f***ing love it.
No wonder rich people in america are so rich.
Stopped in for a business banker without an appointment.
Great first impression of customer service!
Marc s (or mark s?)
Always helps me when i go to this location.
In the future when i go to this bank i am always going to ask for him.
He is just an all-around nice guy and i feel like he genuinely wants to help me.
I don't know why this location has such low stars.
I haven't ever gone there and had anyone ever be rude to me!
I've been using bank of arizona for over 1.5 years now for my small business.
I think i opened my account with $50 and have never been charged a fee.
Nor will i ever).
It was a pleasure to work with blue brick financial.
The team (linda) expedited my process and simplified my life tremendously.
Even when i didn't have the complete information they went ahead and research it till they got an answer.
I will totally work with them again.
We worked with john fink to refinance our home in austin.
No one is better in the business.
He is ethical and upfront with every tiny detail.
Our first contact was with the branch manager jameil palmer by telephone.
We were surprised to get a same day call back with the exact information and details we needed.
We were very happy with the customer service that he provided.
The next day we went into the bank and met with oscar garcia personal banker.
We gave him a little history and he said that he would be happy to assist us.
I only wish all banks had employees that our passionate about excellent customer service.
The great reviews are definitely warranted for this place.
The whole experience from top to bottom was excellent!
Got my vault in a speedy and efficient manner.
All of my questions were answered in a friendly manner as well.
Keep up the great service!
Awesome staff take care of everything.
Love that they're a small biz and so connected with the community too.
I had a wonderful experience here today.
The manager was very patient and answered a million questions i had.
Its always scary to leave your belongings you know..
He ensured me that i am in good hands and have nothing to worry about.
The prices were not bad, totally worth it in my opinion..
If you don't trust the banks like me this is the place to go!
Mark brandon is always very responsive.
He and his staff always calls or emails me back, quickly.
State farm is a gigantic company.
But, mark is my go to guy on insurance.
I appreciate his suggestions on insurance and his patience in explaining it to my family.
Myself and my family have been using joy as our agent for almost 25 years.
Walking into their office is always a pleasant experience for us and their customer service exceeds expectations every time.
I would highly recommend this office.
I practically know everyone in the office.
They are nice, friendly and knowledgeable.
Bill johnson and his staff have taken great care of us and been there for us when we needed them.
We eventually moved out of surprise and back into phoenix ( asu west area).
I bring this up because we could have switched to another agent way closer to home.
However, that never crossed our mind.
Like a good neighbor state farm is there !
Whether i go into the branch, or through the drive-thru, everything is done quickly and efficiently.
I have never had any problems or long waits.
Two thumbs up to the whole staff!
Thank you very much for being nice and help us get a vault fast and easy.
We will recommend your services to all our friends and family.
Have a great day.
I keep going back and forth when i need a safety box.
It's a little expensive, i won't lie.
But to each his own when it comes to priories :)  hope that helps.
Sunwest has been my bank of choice for the last 15 years!
I have yet to visit this location and have a bad experience.
I've followed her to this location because i know i can always count on her to answer all my questions.
Ed the older gentleman that works here is a hoot!
I absolutely love his personality!
Sunwest is also insured by the national credit union association which helps once again ease my mind.
I also like that you have several different options when it comes to managing your accounts.
This credit union also has overdraft protection fees which we all know is important.
Thanks for making my life easy and hassle free if i could give this location ten stars i would!
Really glad i found the american guardian.
The enrollment process was quick, easy and informative.
Once i found a home and my offer was accepted, rusty went right to work.
I will continue to use their service for a long time.
In a city like las vegas its a good idea to secure your valuables in a safe place.
Most banks are out of safety deposit boxes but who cares i found what i was looking for!
So i researched blue brick and checked with the bbb.
They are a fantastic company with a good reputation.
I tried to get my own bank to match their offer first and they couldn't touch it.
I refinanced with blue brick in december and it went smoothly and easily.
My mortgage payment changed only slightly and i went from a 30 to a 20 year loan.
I highly recommend them and will try to get into a 15 if the rates drop again.
I worked specifically with chris seago, aaron beynon and meissa darby.
So happy i found them.
Love this branch, people know me and seem to want to be helpful.
My wife and i have our personal accounts here, and i have my business account with midfirst as well.
I'm from out of state and i often use this branch as it part of the shared branch credit service.
I've always had great customer service and easy withdrawal and processing of bank needs.
Steve tarrant has all my stuff.
It saved me the hassle of making a phone call to check it out.
He's got my back!
The people at truwest are fantastic!
The service is great.
The people are friendly.
And it is one of the best  credit unions i have ever been a member of.
I've been with alterna for several years and have had nothing but pleasant and helpful encounters with their staff.
They've met all my needs easily.
Very good bank... no fees for most services!
I have to say i love this branch.
I'm also a bofa client and wells fargo beats them down hard in las vegas.
Mirna lopez is my absolute favorite lady.
So helpful and asks questions if she's not clear on something.
I was even offered water once!
They also have lollipops out front.
I'm always greeted too when i enter.
Love wells fargo branch here!!
This bank has it's act together.
Everyone is very profesional, eager to help but not overly over bearing.
If wells fargo is not your bank it should be.
Great experience at bancless today.
The staff was very helpful and friendly.
I needed some coins for a father's day gift.
It was the perfect place to get what i wanted quickly and the prices were right too!
I'll definitely go back.
I would like to regard the general manager lemotd anderson.
I really was frustrated from the delay that i got for the money wiring, it took like a month.
I was extremely mad.
But the treatment that i got from mr anderson was great and must mentioned.
I honestly did not get any refund of the wiring, but requested the money to be back.
You are the right person in the right place.
I was out looking for an insurance with an agent that can help and answer my concerns regarding coverage.
It's always nice to have an agent that knows what they are doing.
Just a phone call away and i'm convinced and happy with my insurance coverage.
Thank you for your help.
To make it easier, he's located nearby where we reside.
Mark brandon - state farm insurance agency is just up the street from my new loft.
When i needed accurate answers and prompt service, mark and his staff was perfect.
Mark brandon made me feel totally comfortable with all of the information i needed.
He is a nice guy and i enjoyed  my visit.
He was able to quote and cover my home and auto in the same day i called.
I believe him to be extremely fair and reliable.
I highly recommend mark and his staff.
2) the three rules of banking never applied: convenience, cost, and care.
My old bank, although with tons of branches spread out everywhere, was never convenient.
The costs associated with the accounts were exorbitant and they raised my credit card interest rate to 38% "just because".
And nobody new my name after years of banking at the same branch.
Could you "pretend" to care?
If patience is a virtue and knowledge is power, jennifer craft is both virtuous and powerful.
Big plus for us bank: current and former united states military service members receive "platinum checking" at no charge.
Big pluses for this branch: care with a capital "c".
Open seven days a week.
A bank open on sunday!
In the words of big dan teague (john goodman) "see you in the funny papers, boys!"
Started banking here about 3 years ago after having numerous experiences with the big banks.
I will never go back.
I love going in to this branch.
Everyone is always very friendly and makes it a very quick and easy visit.
I highly recommend switching over to this credit union if you're looking for a nice change.
Not only is the service excellent; but the attitude and the smiles are genuine.
We are newer clients with chase.
Fyi- if you want to open a check or savings account it's by appointment only!
Btw: this is one of their busier locations!
Opened a savings account for my daughter on friday.
Personal bank assistant was claudia.
She's been at this location for approximately 8 years.
Claudia worked with chase a total of 13 years!
Professional, patient & kind.
Entire process from start to finish is about an hour.
Additional info: they offer a high school checking accounts with many options.
My daughter walked out with a planner & money in the bank to start her future!
Can't feel any more pleased than that!
I recently (within the passed few months) started investing and diversifying my portfolio with gold and silver.
I found bancless on yelp while looking for a good local bullion shop.
The reviews were pretty good so i decided to pop my head in there.
I'm sure glad i did.
I am always felt welcome at this shop and the staff is always friendly with me.
I will continue going to this shop as such and will definitely be a regular client.
Thank you guys for helping me achieve financial decisions that are right for me.
Thankfully, it is run very well.
Service has always been pleasant and polite, as you'd expect from any other td branch.
The tellers have always been very knowledgable when i ask questions, including questions about my credit cards, travelling and easyweb.
Im rely recommend this place for anyone who's  looking for a safe deposit box.
I absolutely love this state farm office.
They always go above an beyond to help me.
I recently purchased a new car and courtney made the insuring process simple and easy.
I like this location.
I'm always in and out very quickly.
I have never waited more than 5 minutes to speak to a banker.
I've never had a problem that they couldn't help me with.
Call 'em a big impersonal corporate bank if you like, but this branch has it right.
I recently purchased a samsung blu-ray player from this shop after seeing an ad on craigslist.
There was a minor indiscrepancy over the price as the ticket read one price and the ad said another.
Obviously, they gave us the price advertised.
*note it is "pawn first" on facebook.
I just signed my second year contract with them today because i know my things are in good, trustworthy hands.
The employees that i've met with are always really friendly and make me feel welcome.
I have sent family and friends to use them as well and everyone feels that their possessions are safe there.
I would recommend everyone to use them if you need to store your valuables.
Saved me from spending a ton o money on a fake rolex.
He was knowledgeable and explained everything.
I will be back soon to buy or any pawning needs that i may have.
I was very impressed with these guys.
I contacted them through yelp to ask for a quote and they responded very quickly.
After shopping around for quotes, these guys definitely had the best rate.
I went in and got my euros with no problem.
The staff member i dealt with was very professional and verified with me how much i was exchanging.
She counted it all right in front of me before handing it to me.
I'll definitely be coming back here next time.
I moved here from chicago in '02.
I cannot believe how many things there are to do here!
I love our climate- summer is hot but it only sucks for a couple months.
I think it's really fun that you have to dig and research for our gems.
My heart is definitely here!
Good customer service and solid credit union.
Personal banker bettyanne is awesome, she always follows up and is very easy going.
Amazing customer service and response time .
Talk about good stress !
Mark and team were right on it .
You got us fully covered from home to home , our cars ,term life , umbrella policy.
With home and even our safe driver discounts i might add .
Mark , thank you for over 15 years of handling all our primary insurance needs .
This review is long over due !
I have been using this bank over 15 years now.
Best customer service ever, i would recommend this bank over any other, because it is member owned.
Great customer service, always helpful, security protection 100%.
I would recommend this place to anyone!
Needed to open up a new account.
Katie was wonderful, got us set up and done in no time.
The best i've received in phoenix!
This office is with the times, unlike my experiences with recent agents.
I am a realtor® with platinum real estate professionals and am very pleased with my relationship with national title company.
Their service is excellent and prompt.
Their support with their comprehensive open house package is very helpful.
I've never had a bad experience at a wells fargo branch.
This location is no exception.
The cashier i was dealing with was fast, efficient, and friendly.
Although i'm in the area often, i didn't notice this location until recently.
Since i'm in the area 4-5x a week, i'm sure this will be a regular spot for me.
Overall, a solid visit to the bank.
Return factor - 80%.
We came across this business while we were in vegas for work.
The whole experience getting a safe deposit box was great!
They were able to explain and answer a million questions me and my boyfriend had.
Stuff was very knowledgeble and proffessional.
They assured us that our belongings are safe with them.
First off, i want to compliment beau for his exceptional customer service.
He was very kind and very knowledgeable.
Truwest's cd rates are hard to beat in today's market.
He also gave me a gift.
Overall, i was very impressed how beau handled himself.
I was also very impressed about this particular branch.
(52nd and roosevelt) but what impressed me the most was the services that truwest offers.
Blue brick financial is awesome.
They did a great job on getting me home loan.
I was very happy with their service.
Roger kept me in the loop at all times and i would recommend this company to all my friends.
Zach over at chase bank has truly and continues to be amazing.
He's not the "sales type" where people really push to sell you something.
He truly cares about the people he works with and sits down and explains everything.
I'm so happy how my refinance is going so far and will be sure to update again once i close...
Awesome lending institutions and amazing service zach turner has provided me.
Thank you chase and thank you zach!!!!
Met andre guntzel today at this branch and he was top notch.
Nice to have that personal touch.
I've used bancless for years.
Great guest service and great loan rates.
I love this branch!
Beautiful design, fast efficient service and good saving products.
Michelle chan is a great financial advisor!
This isn't a review about chase's checking or savings account options.
Those types of things are the same regardless of which chase you frequent.
This is a review for this particular branch--and namely how pleasant and helpful the staff is here.
The bank is big, clean, and well lit.
The staff is attentive and engaged.
If you're already a chase customer, this particular branch is a gem.
No surprises, no hidden fees, just a great company to deal with.
An ode to arizona: a rendition from the wizard of az  scorpions, and rattlesnakes, and bearizona.
Buttes, and washes, and valley fever.
Monsoons, and forest fires set by humans, and haboobs.
The stupid motorist law, and half day kindergarten, and sb1070.
Lumberjacks, and wildcats, and sun devils.
More drones, and minute men, and a tall fence.
There's a state gun?
Hoover dam, and lowell observatory, and air force facility missile site 8.
Tombstone, and route 66, and the grand canyon.
Goldfield ghost town, and rawhide, and the o.k.
Petrified forest national park, and organ pipe cactus national monument, and montezuma castle national monument.
Slide rock state park, and fool hollow lake recreation area, and dead horse ranch state park.
I wouldn't live anywhere else.
So i was passing through vegas for an unfortunate estate sale from a family member passing away.
The value was immeasurable!
This is the wild wild west and your not even gonna have an armed guard?!
I found american guardian on yelp and shot over.
I walked in the door and the security guard immediately said hello and asked how can help me.
I appreciated how much security they had, and how attentive this dude was!
I honestly thought he was a cop when i first saw him.
I immediately knew he was sizing me up lol.
I was super happy with how clean the place was!
I filled out the paperwork, made a cash payment for several months, and was out the door in no time!
This place is awesome!
The guard was super attentive and i was very appreciative with how much detail the staff payed attention to.
Thank you guys and whoever there security is, good looking out!
Defiantly recommended and will do business with again.
Having to travel often i was always left behind with worries about my house and the valuables in it.
I needed a safe deposit box so i went to my bank.
They had six months waiting list so the search began...
I found the american guardian online and went to check them out and glad i did.
Very organize facility with hardcore security.
Very pleasant customer care, with answers to every one of my worries.
I've been with them for over a year and will be with them for many more.
Some people are vegans, some people eat organic, some people buy local, and some people ride their bikes.
I on the other hand, bank with a credit union.
Because the credit unions are owned by credit union account holders.
Something that has a nice ring to things whenever i find myself in bragging contest with a group of hipsters.
I have a confession, i have an rbc account too.
But rbc, who is connected to visa, calls me at the most annoying times with their telemarketing schemes.
However they do ensure just as great security and accounts that are competitive/affordable.
Credit unions are not for everyone, but truwest's mccormick/hayden location makes a fan out me!
The staff is friendly, hours are convenient, and i've never waited more than a few minutes for a teller.
Have not had a service problem at any of the truwest locations in five plus years.
I can't say enough about this bank.
They used to be mainly a business bank but branched out to consumer.
Customer service is top notch.
Lena got me all set up with accounts and a safe deposit box.
I recently bought a house, and just to be nice i let them compete for the mortgage.
Steve howard was amazing - very knowledgeable, and had perfect follow up and stuck with me for months.
They came in cheaper than the broker who has been servicing my family for years, so they did my mortgage.
The personal service and eagerness to go above and beyond in every way has be very loyal to this bank.
At first the person i was working with needed prompting to move things along.
That person left the company and then i got rebecca arellano to work with.
If i had had her from the start, it would be five stars.
Refi went quick after that and as advertised.
If you refi with them, i recommend you request her.
Fast through the drive thru, every time.
I love banking with dsfcu.
Large and central location in downtown las vegas.
Clean and managed by solid individuals.
Never had a problem.
I was here on business (to meet with the owner), and was greeted by the friendliest staff.
These guys are seriously more outgoing than many staffers at nordstrom!
The store is neat, clean, and as one reviewer noted "doesn't stink like other pawn shops."
And from what i can tell, they have all of their teeth.
No really, they are all really nice guys!
Every time i visit pawn 1st they are somewhat busy.
Or get some great deals on movies, games, or jewelry.
I even bought a few dvds, for $3.00 each!
Keep up the good work, guys!
I do enjoy coming to this banking center.
There is a friendly staff and the lines are usually not too long.
I prefer using the drive-thru atms, because this bank has them updated to deposit cash and checks, with no envelopes!
I've never had a bad experience here!
This branch can get busy as it's in a prime location in town.
Lines move pretty quickly and atms are easy to navigate.
Staff is also friendly.
"our" branch closed so we are using the one in awahtukee.
My husband went to this bank by referral thru several co-workers in feb 2018.
It's the best decision he's made.
He was helped by a banker named estela.
She went over the car loan application thoroughly and it was quick and easy.
A few months later i decided to apply for a car loan as well and was pre-approved.
I procrastinated purchasing a car so my loan expired.
However, one phone call away was estela and she re-submitted my application and got it activated again.
Kudos to estela for an excellent customer service!!!
I highly recommend her to help anybody with their loan needs.
The joy estes office sets the bar high when it comes to insurance!
I would recommend them for anyone that looking for a knowledgeable and caring insurance office in the scottsdale area.
Rebecca and james are absolutely wonderful to work with!!
They are a great team and make things happen, while keeping their clients best interest in hand!!
Getting a true no cost refinance has really saved me!!
Thanks again rebecca and james!!
Best customer service i've experienced in the fifteen years i've owned a business.
Every individual at this bank provides​ sterling, knowledge service.
I strongly recommend this branch.
Charles, crystal, raquel, monica, courtney et al.
I highly recommend his services.
Dan is definitey the best mortgage officer in the las vegas valley.
Blue brick was fast and friendly.
They were on top of everything and i was refinanced within the month.
These guys were awesome.
Thank you blue brick.
Great, friendly, super fast customer service & they have a drive-thru!
(: i've been to several wells fargo locations & this one is by far my favorite.
No ridiculous lines and long waits.
I can tell how passionate and motivated he is about his job and helping others.
But everyone else is really great.
You get personalized service like you're some big wig with tons of money even if you aren't.
The can do everything a big bank can, except they have more limited hours/locations.
I can guarantee you no big bank would do that!
So, the limitations are far outweighed by the great customer service i get from almost everyone there.
I've been referred to the american guardian by a friend who got a safety deposit box there.
After losing patience of waiting for my bank to make one available for me i decided to rent one there.
Very nice customer service and great security.
I defiantly recommend to use this company for anyone who has a need for a safe deposit box.
I recently used national title when i bought my new home.
I was really pleased with how well they know the laws about title and escrow.
All my questions were carefully answered.
The customer service was awesome too.
The only place in las vegas i trust to protect my valuables...thank you so much for what you do!
A great company and very pleasant customer service.
I truly feel comfortable and at peace leaving my valuables there.
All my friends have raved about this place and i honestly got tired of leaving valuables at my house.
Been a customer for few years now and will continue to be for many more.
I'm here 4-5 times a week for doing my work deposits.
Julie and her team go above and beyond for every customer.
Probably the best branch in las vegas.
We've banked here for 2 years.
We moved from wells fargo to alleviate the fees are kids would experience after turning 18.
Very cheerful tellers that know what they're doing.
This this probably my favorite bac branch in the phoenix metro area.
I love all the new cibc branch.
They all have similar design with the huge store front 2 storeys windows letting the natural light filter in.
This building used to be part of canadian tire before they renovated it to be one of cibc's branches.
The inside is spacious and clean with nice waiting area.
The one thing i love the most is their hours!!!
Open weekends saturday 9:30 am to 4:00 pm and sunday 12:00 pm to 4:00 pm.
Tons of parking and if you don't even want to park, they have a drive thru... great during winter time!
I have to say my absolute first impression when i walked in was not super great.
No one really seemed all that interested in helping me.
I can't see myself going to any other bank again thus far.
That stuff is all really great but what really did it for me was their website and mobile app.
The payment system accu has rivals paypal in my opinion, for how i have used paypal in the past anyway.
It's not to say midfirst is bad, they aren't.
This is just much better in my opinion.
Came here for the first time today .
I do not have a account here but needed proof of an auto loan i paid off years ago.
The customers service  girl was right on it !!!
She was very professional and got things done in just one quick phone call.
Thank you customer service girl !!
Best experience  at a credit union in many years and have not had any real bad ones.
Very efficient  and knowledgeable  staff.
Have had sooooo many very bad experiences  with banks over the years especially  wells ago.
I tried to join navy a few years ago but 4 years af, vietnam,  23 yrs faa, still didn't count.
Then i was pleasantly  surprised  to find they were accepting  veterans.
I signed up immediately.
Highly recommend  for vets.
Get far away from banks then run!
I work for one of the other guys....but like progressive...i like these folks so i also shop with them.
So unlike other credit unions, this is an exclusive membership as i did work for a university years ago.
Shawn is truly amazing at his job and provides outstanding customer service.
I'm not a fan of boa but he does a great job!
Keep up the great work.
I was in florida at the time on a long term assignment, hundreds of miles from a keybank.
I discovered the fraudulent charges when i checked my balance just before leaving on a road trip.
I called the customer service number and within a few hours all my money was back in my account.
They made the whole recovery process so easy.
Miss this bank, big time.
Shana great service thanks, clean laundry great that open 24 hours...will come again.
I've been a member of cccu for 10 years!
My family and i love their friendly staff who is always ready and willing to help.
Recently i bought a new car and i knew exactly who to call to help me with financing.
Amber is my lady!
She has helped guide me through all of my financial decisions and always has my best interest in mind.
Thanks so much amber!
Great bank all the staff is super friendly and professional.
Everyone greets me by name when i come in every day.
Always willing to help me when i have weird situations.
Staff is friendly and always willing to help.
Every time i go in i am welcomed right way.
This is for the credit card department of chase bank.
Our id has been compromised five times and each time chase has caught it as it is happening.
They call to make sure it is not we who are charging these item and close the account right then.
We have never had to do anything beyond acknowledging their actions.
One time in paris france gus dropped his wallet at a restaurant.
When we went back they had the wallet but not the chase card.
It was at the hotel when we arrived.
I have nothing but good to say about chase credit fraud department, they are on the ball.
Azfcu reached out and situation was discussed so i have added a star.
The visa program was down causing decline on card transactions.
________________________________________________ customer service is not helpful.
Money in the account and the card was declined.
Called customer service to find out what block was on the account or what transactions needed to be verified.
Welcome to perpetual distress and no usable debit card.
45 minutes = frustration and still no answer.
Very convenient - open 24/7.
Extremely friendly, helpful staff on hand to assist with questions while he washes loads for full-service customers.
Most machines are operational.
Washing machines are fast and thorough.
Only con: the dryers are cheap (25 cents for 9 minutes), but you get what you pay for.
I was really impressed about this place.
Most of the girls are really hot.
The lap dances are off the chain.
They are fully nude, too; and you can touch.
Also, they lie you down on this bed.
If you could drink in this club, it would of got 5 stars.
The lap dances make this club, though.
Open account and new credit card at navy federal today.
Service was awesome, good product line good interest rates.
Ask for anna sauer, she was awesome.
I can't tell you how many times this bank has been here for me.
It's my local bank and i frequent this location a lot for my personal needs.
Atm's are always working and easy to use!
During open hours, bankers are always happy to help me.
Very glad this wells fargo is in my neighborhood!
It's friday, payday and lunch time .. line moved quickly ..
Convenient atm next to drive through versus some older locations with atm attached to the building.
I was able to get things done without stepping out of my vehicle.
They both did a great job to get this deal done......thank you!
It took bravery for me to go east of the strip and i'm glad i did.
Recent transplant in las vegas, amber's been amazing to me.
She's always checking up on me, and catching things for me.
Helpful reminders cus god knows i need it lol.
I come here to wash our comforter since our home washer and drier aren't large enough to accommodate it.
Disregard the few hysterical reviews stating this place is unsafe or unclean.
They are patently false.
It's really just code for "i miss white suburbia".
I am writing this note as a humble appreciation for the outstanding customer service provided by kayla.
Her ability to provide the resolution quickly exceeded my expectations.
She has a caring approach and she is a true professional.
Jennifer and jill are a gem at this location.
They make you feel like family and are always kind.
Jennifer is the reason i started an account here instead of using my shared branching.
I love going inside to say hi.
I had a great first time experience.
I've never been in there until today and i have to say i like the set up .
The little offices are cute .
I went in to get a paper notarized and it was effortless .
Not sure about the actual clerk transactions .
What an amazing agency!
I had my first accident and was so nervous, i was thrilled with how they handled everything!
A big agency, with that "hometown feel".
I love this bank!
They are always friendly fast and helpful.
Chris at flamingo and i think her name is amanda at stephanie, they are the best locations!
For gilbert wells fargo banks...
This is my 1st choice because of the customer service & no pressure banking.
Other banks are pushy about signing up for credit cards, savings accounts and who knows what else...
But not this bank.
Fast, efficient, friendly, free bottle of water (yeah baby!
But thats not their fault!
This branch is great!
The staff is very friendly and helpful as well as knowledgable.
Great customer service, going above and beyond over any other banks in the neighborhood!
Glad to bank here and recommend them..
I have been with this location when it was founder's bank.
I've seen the change overs.
All told, it's been 17 years that i've been going into this branch.
Not once have any of these employees been anything less than friendly, courteous and professional.
I'm not a business owner, nor do i have tons of money in my accounts.
They've never treated me poorly.
I can't speak for the gentleman's poor review.
Perhaps he has valid complaints, but i do not.
Judge for yourself, i say.
The money museum here is one of the hidden gems of cleveland.
Interesting stuff here for both adults and kids.
You get a free sample of shredded money after your visit, $2.5 billion a year of cash is shredded here!
Needless to say this is a very high security place..
I have been ensured with bill quigley's office for many years and have had a few claims.
Each and every time, state farm has always been extremely helpful and more than fair in their valuations.
I would recommend them to family and friends!
Mario at the front desk was kind and helpful and even better- a yankees fan!
Very close to off the main strip and open 24 hours!
Excellent large space with many washers and dryers to accomodate everyone :)
Great option for the regular more pricier service offered on the hotels.
Depending on how much dirty clothes you have got, its probably even worth it to cab it off here.
You can either do it yourself or leave it for them to do it.
I left it in the morning and picked it up 4 hours later.
If you leave it to them, they charge you by the pounds, and the dry-clean option is charged by pcs.
I did the wash and fold option which they charge me almost nothing for.
Fast, convenient and accurate service...isnt that what its all about?
Bank manager elisa, david, and their team members were super awesome in taking care of my needs!!
Big thank you and keep up the awesomeness!
I just wish i could do more atm banking with cash and check deposits at places in my neighborhood.....
They also offer a lot of atm services so that you can skip waiting in the long teller line.
Love b of a!
I'm in vegas and i'm in a pinch.
I won't opt to let the hotel charge me $7 a piece of clothing but i'm running out if clothes.
So, i use yelp and find this diamond in the rough.
Upon first glance the area is a bit sketchy looking.
Once inside i'm greeted with polite smiles from strangers just doing their laundry mid day.
I put a suitcase full of clothes in for about $4.
I sit down, enjoy some tv, and surf the web with their free wifi.
Then i ran the dryer and done.
As far as having to do laundry in a foreign town goes, i'm feeling at home.
And for an affordable price.
I can enthusiastically recommend a hope bail bonds, specifically jim.
I called him late at night trying to figure out what to do to help a family member.
It was late sunday night of a three-day weekend, banks are closed until tuesday,  i live 2000 miles away.
There were no hidden fees, 15% of bail plus the  $50 filing fee required by the jail.
The number i called to get jim was 702-825-2245.
Donna has been my agent for about 11 years now.
She takes care of my insurance for my cars, home, life and business as well as some retirement accounts.
Donna has also handled some claims for us, with great results.
Her team is very knowledgeable and professional.
The employees at this truwest branch are always courteous and kind.
I highly recommend truwest cu!
Along the phoenix metro light rail line).
This cu closed on saturdays and sundays.
The also have 2 drive-thru lines on the side of the building as well as a night drop-off box.
The cu is locate on top of an athletic facility.
Make sure you get your parking pass validate when you visit the bank.
All the bank employees are friendly and very polite and they all know exactly what they are doing.
I would definitely recommend this cu if you are new to the area and/or need a good loan rate.
I really like coming here to do the deposits for my work.
The employees megan and fernando are pretty awesome.
They are always quick and friendly with the deposit.
When you withdraw money from them, you do not get charged a fee for it.
Arizona business bank is a great place to do your banking.
Thanks arizona business bank for doing a great job!!!
I wish i could give you 10 stars  for being an awesome bank.
Owning a business on mill ave it's been an absolute pleasure dealing with the staff at this location.
Every single employee remembers you by first name basis and makes you feel like an important client.
A very busy branch but never wait too long.
Been using it for years , really friendly people at this location !
The people who complain must not to go the bank often lol
I've never enjoyed banks...really never.
If you're sick of the major banks and the total lack of customer service, give this place a try.
They have locations all over the valley, and the state.
I've never been able to say i was happy with my bank until the last year.
It was 6pm so they'd just closed but there were still employees in the branch.
Red lights start flashing after it spat 7 bills back.
My card wasn't coming back our either    super frustrated!
She gave me the info to try to resolve my money that got jammed inside the atm.
At that  time she pointed out the tiny sign near where u deposit your money saying only 25 bills.
In my opinion the big sign when your logging on to the atm should say 25 bills, not 50!
My saving grace after being in a bad mood to begin with was sandy!
She's who i spoke to on the phone.
Her pleasant attitude and bubbly attitude turned my bad experience into a much more tolerable one.
I hope you and oncu rsee that you are a 10 star person for oncu!
The 3 stars are because of the 2 different bill amounts allowed which doesn't make things clear enough.
I've been with oncu for over 10 years.
My sister also banks with you.
I need my tips to pay my bills.
Really not happy right now, in fact i'm crying because this is extremely stressful.
I spoke today with cindy the branch manager and she explained a lot of things to me.
They now have signs on the atm saying not to put in more than 25 bills.
Walking into truwest , i got partnered with a banker named christina, she was amazing.
We had great laughs and she helped me with everything i needed.
I got  approved for the refinance and visited truwest the following week.
We were able to find a free admission through those las vegas magazines.
That saved us $30.
You go in, tell them the number of people, and they will seat you at a table.
We told the bouncer we wanted to smoke hookah so he sat us in a plushy couch in the middle.
They serve alcohol and you will get girls coming to you to get a lap dance.
I had a cute girl who was interested in hookah and getting a lap dance.
This was great for me and her :-) they have three stages of girls dancing.
The light is ambient, red, and dark.
Ok, back to the hookah review.
We wanted our normal capuccino, vanilla, and mint flavor, not any of this fruity stuff.
They only had fruity flavors.
The waitress was cute and she recommended the 'jello' combo.
This is a combination of light fruits.
We went with it and it was pretty good!
I must say the price here is pretty pricey.
Beers are $6 and the hookah was around $24.
If you're in vegas, i highly recommend this place.
It's also walking distance to new orleans casino.
You can also take a shuttle from bill's to new orleans to save some dough.
Best bank in bellevue.
I've never had any issues here as a customer.
When my checkbook was stolen, the staff was super great with offering assistance.
Brittany (banker) was hands down amazing and beyond helpful with helping me set up my new checking and savings account.
Rigo  (manager) introduced himself to me and showed how much he truly did care about me and my account.
Hands down the best experience i have ever had with a bank and their employees
I don't know why it has taken me so long to write a review.
Everyone here is so sweet but marty is particular is amazing.
So nice so helpful and very professional i can't say enough good things about him.
And if you need a bank i would highly recommend here!
Brad's office is super friendly and fast with my needs.
I highly recommend for your insurance needs!!
Unlike other reviews, i didn't have any issues with this bank's customer service or professionalism.
My interactions were very brief, however, and limited to the bankers at their desks and not the tellers.
The banker i worked with was very friendly and professional.
I was greeted when i walked in the door and directed to where i needed to be.
The only unprofessional thing i noticed was an employee glancing at their phone, but honestly... haven't we all done that?
Ended up spending an extra week in vegas.
Got our laundry done quick and in a hurry.
Great service from juan jose!!
He was super friendly and he went the extra mile to help me with all my questions!
They greet you immediately and always make friendly conversation and ask about your day.
Justin just helped me out and even though it was a simple deposit, he was very attentive and friendly!
Definitely great customer service.
Fluff and fold service is the best!
Attendants are very friendly and helpful.
I bring all of my laundry here when i'm in las vegas on extended trips.
One time i dropped my laundry off at 2am and it was ready for pick up at 8:30am.
I was being helped by linda, she's amazing!!
Not only was she able to help me but she was so fast and efficient.
Dark, sketchy, feels like youre in a basement.
All the things a strip club should be.
They have good specials pretty much every night and the girls get way more into it than upscale places.
Overall really fun, and little to no pressure for lap dances!
If you work in this city, especially as a business traveler,  this will be your new favorite laundromat.
They offer same-day wash & fold services (usual turn around is between 2.5-3 hours) and are open 24/7!
No more having to worry about rushing to make it in time after work.
They also offer dry-cleaning services.
They can wash and press shirts for $2, and dry-cleaning starts at $3 i think.
Overall, really great pricing.
Not the lowest in town, but definitely the best value for quality service.
The parking lot (and street) they are located in isn't the cleanest looking, but i've always felt safe.
You just learn to ignore the few, random crazies nearby.
Not your typical stripclub!
More of a lounge atmosphere.
Super friendly staff (and the hottest bartenders in town!!
), non pushy dancers, verrrrry locals friendly!
I've visited other clubs in sin city, but i always come back to the vu
Clean, busy with people, and plenty of machines.
Came here after my sons ball games and it did the job.
In a strip mall filled with weirdos but new washers and great dryers.
Got the job done!
Great location with friendly staff.
I love the ladies at this branch.
I will never go anywhere else to bank not even another us bank.
They've won me over with their complete kindness and sincerity and if that doesn't matter they also have great rates.
I recommend them to all of my family and friends.
They are also conveniently located inside of a safeway that contains a starbucks, what more can you ask for.
I couldn't be more pleased with the service we received at this branch.
We setup both corporate and personal accounts and jenna helped us over several days to get everything perfect.
Every time i visit this branch, i am always treated with the utmost respect and i love it.
They have helped us out with some of the most asinine requests and were able to fulfill it.
I do miss the people that were their when i first started banking with them, but shit happens.
Every time i come to wells fargo i hope to see this lovely woman here.
She's so sweet and kind, she even personalized my cash envelope.
She always makes me wanna come back for some positivity in my day!
Jim helped me today to bail my friend out, he was amazing and very understanding!
I highly recommend this bail bonds to anyone who needs help!
If you are thinking of gett get a refinance i recommend her.. such a sweetheart!!!
If you read this cindy thanks again for all the help you did...
Location is sketchy, like most places near the strip, but once inside you'll find a standard laundromat.
They have a great variety of machines along with quarter dispensers.
Soap costs a buck.
So it seems safe to leave your clothes in the machines.
So if it's safe for an nba team, it's safe for you too.
I have been insured with bill quigley's office since moving to the valley in 2005.
I typically deal with shirley in the office.
She is always professional and very responsive.
Quigley's office has always provided accurate and timely information.
I would definitely recommend this office if you are looking for home,auto, life or health insurance.
They also offer the state farm banking and personal liability insurance.
This office definitely lives up to the "good neighbor" philosophy.
We worked with a gentleman named corey who answered the phone and has treated us like we're family.
Its people like corey that keeps us coming back to this bank to do our business with.
He should be cloned!
We love clark county and we really love corey!
Dave was recommended by a coworker of mine when i needed to buy a home.
Dave has also handled all the situations with professionalism and expertise.
I would highly recommend him.
I had a great experience at this chase branch last week.
Came in very close to closing -- the place was mobbed.
I needed to order checks.
Checks ordered without the need to go in again.
Thank you gina contine at one nevada.
Very professional and nice.
Gina had all my paperwork ready for me to sign and she answered several questions i had, very organized!
My husband and i are fans of one nevada credit union.
Linda woodford is always on top of her game when it comes to helping with loans and other financial services.
I would definitely recommend them!
Great day trip for the kids!
We all enjoyed learning about the history of money.
Everyone was so nice, too!
Found this laundry on yelp while staying at the hardrock.
Hardrock wanted $6 just to wash one pair of jeans!
Place had great reviews so i decided to give it a try.
Wash and fold is offered 24hrs a day for $1.50 a pound.
Turn around is 4 to 5 hours and they were right on the money.
An entire week of dirty clothes was $14!
Both attendants were great and genuinely cared about my clothing.
The clothing was returned to me expertly folded and smelling awesome!
Area does appear sketchy but no one bothered me and everyone i spoke too was friendly.
All in all this was a great laundry experience and i highly recommend.
Also have heard theres some great mexican food in the strip.
Have to try next time.
My experience with truwest began over 40 years ago, and i have always had excellent service.
The employees make me feel at home, like family.
The web and mobile apps are very functional and easy to use.
Whether i am at home or away, i can always get the support and service i need.
Went to the atm and they don't have fees with my bank so that is a huge plus for me!!
Appreciate them having an atm in my time of need :)
I had a very pleasant experience at this boa location!
Jon henry helped my sister and i!
He really made everything easy and explained everything to us!
I would go to this location again just because of him
Always come to this place to cash my my check every two weeks.
The staff is always friendly and  works hard on making sure all my needs are met.
I want to thank cheyenne for the incredible service she provides to her customers.
She has gone above and beyond and always friendly.
Thank you for your dedication to your customers and job.
I would also like to mention that i have read reviews from others with 1 star.
It a shame how people are so quick to complain and not share their good experiences.
Everyone was so nice at this wells fargo and it's never a wait.
Idk why it has such bad reviews but i come here and never have any issues.
Great customer service and helped me with a process of opening and closing a few accounts...
Great staff thanks jim and ronald for all your help.
They made it real easy to open a 2nd checking account, and very knowledgeable..
My washer at home was down and i needed to do my family's laundry.
Came here and redeemed the 9 minutes free drying by checking in.
I also forgot soap and was pleasantly surprised they were offering free soap.
Don't know the brand but it did the job.
I wouldn't recommend coming here during the afternoon.
I think it would get pretty sketchy here at night.
The workers here are very nice and helpful though.
The customer service in this bank is amazing.
I felt transported back in time when banks knew their clients and valued a face to face transaction.
I still remember the smell and excitement i felt watching my money grow.
The teller was so nice.
It was my first time there but she treated me like and old friend.
As she was quickly and efficiently taking care of business she engaged in conversation with me.
She asked questions and was genuinely interested in me as a human.
I feel terrible that i do not remember her name but her birthday is 2 days after mine.
I am so grateful to come across my pisces sister in this chase bank.
If you live in the area this is the place to bank.
Thank you for restoring my faith in true customer connection.
I have been a desert school fcu customer for 20+ years.
I have never had an issue, not even once, when dealing with dsfcu.
If there is a mistake, they immediately correct it.
If i make a mistake, it's not a condescending "told ya so" mannerism.
I have a vehicle loan with dsfcu as well and the rate i received was the best around.
I always am treated in a calm, cool, and professional manner no matter who i work with at dsfcu.
With all the bad news on wells fargo, i decided to check our bank accounts (checking and savings).
(we sold our home).
Today, i called 3 times with no good advice or wrong advice from various csr.
I was ready to close all our accounts but your good training saved the day.
This chase is at green valley pkwy and pebble, surrounded by shops i frequent often.
It's not physically possible for this branch, since it's between two other businesses.
You won't get weird looks at the drive-thru.
Teller service has always been efficient and friendly.
Atm at the entrance is available 24/7.
Parking is ample and never a problem, unless you come sunday and run into the brunch crowd.
That's when you realize chase is closed (yes, which i've done!)
And end up walking over to cracked egg to get some coffee cake.
Beatrice was more than welcoming and professional.
She made sure we were treated like vips.
The whole bachelor party would return for beatrice!
She deserves a raise or great tips!
Debbie padilla, she was the most polite person i've ever met in the bank/credit industry.
She was such happy person and made me feel good joining their credit union.
I'm happy with the decision i made today joining and meeting with her especially.
I just have to say though, every time i'm here there is the sweetest girl working named shana.
She is the hardest working person i've seen in quite some time.
She cleans this place from top to bottom!
Management- give this girl a raise!
The place has good options for different laundry needs and i rarely see a machine down unlike most places.
On howard hughes drive off sands.
Easy walk from the wynn, about 15 min, staff was very friendly and helpful!
The neighborhood wasn't the greatest but the facility was well kept thanks to the staff.
The washers and dryers worked great and there was plenty to choose from.
The staff was extremely helpful and kind.shannah was on top of her job and got us whatever we needed.
I'll be using this facility again soon.
I washed my color clothes for about 3.75.
And my whites for about 1.75 and dryer i spent about a 2.00 for both my loads.
And esteban was great on suggesting which size washer i should use for both of my loads.
Hard working and very personable kind of guy.
I'll definitely be coming back.
Ok,  so what do you do in vegas with a bunch of  co-workers after the trade show has just finished?
Well one dumb ass in the group...who shall remain nameless...joe!....says, "let's go to a tittie bar!".
Oh shit, here we go again.
They of course say, "hell yes !"
So we get a cab and it drives the 4 of us to deja vu showgirls.
Don't pay him"  i've never gotten such a look of hatred from a cab driver, but it's true.
Then we get to the door.
Joe is lost, he asks me... "so you don't pay the cab driver, but you pay the door man?"
"yup" is all i say.
We sit down and immediately get surrounded by girls and waitresses.
They know a big tipper only gets the good table.
The big bouncer guy comes over and apologizes for the the mad rush.
He gives all the girls a stern look and they shrink away.
I have never seen a happier man.
Some strippers come by...rather cautiously and ask if anybody would like a $30 a song lap dance?
And slinks away all sexy like.
The men at the table are now like wtf?!?
I tell them..."hey look around?
How many lap dances do you see?"
"exactly, the girls are going to get hungry soon."
Not 10 mins later, the dj comes on and say, "gentleman it's your lucky day !
-  3 song lap dances are now $30!"
They all turn to me and say, "mark, how many strip clubs have you been to?
"only 2, i reply,...but i've had a stripper for a roommate."
You should have seen their jaws drop.
"listen guys" i say, "most of these girls are on coke right now.
She sees me and comes over with a wickedly evil smile.
She doesn't say anything and spreads her legs and sits on my lap cowgirl style.....
I stifle a yawn,...and look away and take a sip of ice tea.
That got me a punch in the shoulder.
I smile and hold her stare.
Who am i to deny that kind of bold faced lie?
All my co-workers now think i'm god.
What happens in vegas....stays in vegas.....and gets reviewed on yelp
I wasn't expecting much due to the reviews.
I had researched and this is financially a good credit union from what i read.
I went to the location on flamingo and ft. apache that was a little hard to find.
But the customer service was the best i have ever had at any bank.
Krystin was awesome and explained everything to me for a new account.
Showed me how to use online stuff.
We made sure the card worked by showing me the atm.
Seems like they care a lot to me.
I just moved to this area and this is the closest chase bank to my home.
I've been three times now and have had no issues.
Just really helpful knowledgeable staff.
I'm looking forward to using this location more in the future...updates to the review then.
I went into this state farm office today to ask a couple questions and wow, what great people.
Bill, patti and deanne were so nice and helpful with all of my questions.
I love this bank of america location for a couple of reasons.
First is that it is very close to my house.
Second is that it is never busy, you can usually walk right up to the counter.
The only downside to this location is that they do not have a drive-thru.
I know ( lazy) but it is vegas and it is getting hot.
Went to open my account and have been satisfied ever since.
Staff is always friendly and fees are clear cut and explained in the beginning.
I also enjoy the fact that it's a smaller bank.
I would highly recommend this bank
Hands down the best tatty bar ever!
Private dances, fully nude, hot girls whom whose daddie's i thank ever so greatly for not loving them.
No booze but hey...what do u think the parking lot is for?
I came here in a bind, and was greeted with professional, helpful and quick customer service.
The lady who attended me was awesome!
One of those times that made me happy that i bank with td :)
This location is very convenient.
The parking  is great  right in front  of the building  .
The guard  in front of the building  was helpful.
The team at the branch know  all their  customers.
And are always eager to help .. there are no lines
Always great customer service at their branches & never a long wait.
Plus, they support various non profits which makes me happy.
Tayler was very nice and took great care of me.
Joanne, the branch manager is outstanding!
She goes above and beyond for her customers.
It's like banking with a friend, joanne greets you by name with a warm and welcoming smile.
She's a problem solver too, fixes everything.
Her staff is also great.
Shana is so friendly and has an amazing smile!
Thank you for making my trip from hawaii awesome and easy!
What an absolutely beautiful and sexy gentlemans club!
The doorman/host was super nice as well as the rest of the staff.
The girls are really pretty and young.
Fantastic customer service thanks to michael marshall.
Can't say enough great things.
Keep up the excellent work!
This bank proves why you should bank with us bank.
Jennifer went above and beyond to exceed my expectations and truly shows they care for their customers.
Thank you for being a great partnership.
I look forward to many years ahead.
Terrie and cindy helped me get approved for my auto loan at 1.99% awesome =]
It's too bad about the negative reviews.
I am a new member and i used them for an auto loan recently.
The loan process itself was relatively smooth, quick and hassle free.
I got an awesome 2.98 interest rate.
Teresa popp was my loan closer and she was very nice and friendly.
She has been more than helpful.
However, i don't see the big deal.
My main bank that i use, i do everything online and through atm.
Makes life easier that way.
Who would want to go inside and deal with a teller all the time?
Anyway..if you want a loan for something you should try them out, as i had a good experience.
I have utilized az central cu for one of my personal checking + savings account.
I like their mobile application and never have had an issue with their bill services.
I have been happy with my membership over the last two years.
What a trip this place is.
Ladies who work there are wonderful and friendly .
I was in and out in 1 .5 hour without a hitch.
Staff were very helpful and change and machines all worked really well.
Surrounded by families and working people .
Everyone was extremely helpful and efficient.
They were very thorough and explained the entire process.
They posted the bond within the hour after i signed the paperwork.
Will definitely be recommending them to everyone.
This place is great!
Super affordable and the staff is extremely friendly!
All of our clothes came out super clean!
Had the best time here at deja vu.
Check her out guys mariah.
I need a cold shower now.
We have had excellent service at this bank.
They're friendly, professional and have the products we need, including personal and business accounts.
I am staying at a resort in vegas that doesn't have an in house laundry facility.
My laundry was clean and smelled great.
Thank you for the excellent service
Linda was the best!
I re financed with her and she made everything go very smooth and was also extremely nice.
I'm so glad that i'm banking with one nevada now!
In fact, one of the two checks i deposited today was from that visit long ago!
I walked in, got in line and waited (maybe) 4 minutes.
The teller practically whispered, but hey, i'm old and half deaf...she got my shizzit done in a jiffy!
I will no longer waste my valuable time at another crappy branch.
Back here to flamingo i'll be!
I have been banking at wells fargo for many years and this particular branch has excellent customer service.
They are always friendly and helpful.
Sometimes the lines are long, but they try their best to get you in and out as soon as possible.
This branch is located inside the wells fargo building.
Unfortunately, i wasn't able to take any pictures of the bank as security guards inside the building wouldn't allow it.
This branch doesn't open on saturdays.
Maria fuentes has the best customer service skills i have ever seen with a banker.
Kind, fast, yet still socialable.
She's great & i highly recommend you request her!
Very helpful and very sweet
Sharon ruopoli came in to day met dasiy chantell mrs renae was so kind thay are organizations.
And good customer service.
Clean l wood love to work there i pray.
I am more than grateful because of mountain america!
I have been looking for a vehicle for awhile, however i had some issues with my credit.
There staff are very friendly and make you feel welcomed.
She helped me through out the entire process and made everything super easy!
Because of her i am now a proud owner of 99 svt cobra!
Thank you nancy and mountain america!
We also have used his service for our personal wash and fold.
The new stainless steel washers are great.
Was back in town for a weekend and went to the bank to make a deposit.
To my surprise, this location is open sunday!
Wow, i lived nearby for over 4 yrs and never knew that!
Return factor - 100%
The guys at a hope are great!
Very very helpful, professional, efficient and prompt.
This business is definitely a class act!
I was in a difficult situation where i needed proof of insurance sent to a company.
I didn't have their email address or their physical address.
Typically in this situation most people would have told me to get back to them after i got the information.
She went above and beyond for me today.
This bank has great tellers and fast service.
It's clean and the location is very convenient.
It doesn't have a drive up window for teller assistance.
So i've been a customer of bank of america for over 10 years now.
My account is in virginia, but i can access it here.
This branch has a bunch of atms, so there is never a wait unlike some other boa branches.
This last trip to vegas, i actually had to go into the branch.
My dad locked himself out of his account back home since he messed up his pin.
I went into the bank expecting a problem but it is very easy.
He was very professional and it was smooth sailing.
I wish all bank branches worked this well.
Quick, easy, and full of friendly staff that love to get to know you by name.
Thanks, brianna, jennifer, and houa for all assistance and transactions.
Easy to find, very clean.
Attendant was very helpful.
Good parking and very reasonable pricing.
It's the first place we tried in vegas but it did the job for us while traveling!
Great place to get an auto loan.
I don't have the best credit, but got 2.7%.
Everywhere else was over 8%.
Leo was very helpful when i explained my situation and needed to close a secondary checking account.
The guarantee is a 4 hour turn around.
Renee is the woman that helped me and she was amazing.
If you are on vacation, don't have a washer/dryer, or just feeling lazy, come here!
Bilingual service and easy approval....
In town for a basketball tournament.
Hotel washers are on the blink.
This was close by, located in a strip mall.
The staff was extremely personable, helpful and on the grind.
These ladies worked their butts off.
All the supplies you need from detergent, oxyclean, etc.
I stopped in here yesterday (5/12/18) on the off chance they could help me with opening a checking account.
I had just experienced a frustrating time at another name brand bank and felt pretty down.
That is until i met my new "relationship manager" lance.
Well first i must also mention the nice teller that pointed me in his direction.
Very pleasant and helpful as well.
Anyway lance is awesome and defiantly a great asset to this branches team.
He was engaging, friendly and even let me vent about my other experience that had me so bummed.
He was able to get me set up with exactly what i wanted and what was best for my needs.
Thank you lance for making my experience easy and my day much better.
If bofa does an employee appreciation program i certainly think you need to be recognized.
This staff is excellent.
We've been banking with this bank for over 5 years.
We've had a few incidents of fraud and this staff has taken care of us immediately.
They have be professional, polite, sympathetic and accommodating.
J. william quigley has been our state farm insurance broker for many many many years.
His office staff, especially lauren white, is very prompt and professional.
I would highly recommend them to friends, family, and fellow yelpers.
What can i say?
This is a bank.
Well, it's better, because it's a credit union.
Better returns, dividends and typically better customer service.
I only use the drive through at this location.
The parking lot and turn in for the drive through are horrible.
The wait is usually pretty long.
You can't see through the window to see who is talking at you, which weirds me out.
The staff have always been friendly though.
The location is pretty old, but it is clean and well-staffed.
Given that my local branch closed down, i am glad that they are still here...for myself, and for the employees.
I've been coming here a long time and i actually look forward to my weekly visits.
When can you ever say you look forward to bank visits?
These guys make it all the easier.
I like this location and there is a lot of atm's you can easily drive in.
Inside they seem nice if you have a customer service issue.
I came here from the midwest, and i needed a share branching credit union.
In touch was it!
They have given me outstanding service since day one.
Share branching is the way to go.
It is a win/win outcome for both credit unions abroad.
Thank you in touch!
You just doubled your business.
Teresa imel is very approachable and helpful!
Answered all my questions.
She is very knowledgeable too
I wish all banks provided this level of customer service.
In an age where banking is de-humanize with technology, the service at this branch is very refreshing!
Thank you phil thompson
I had a million questions and becca akana was more than pleasant, professional, knowledgeable, and patient.
I came yesterday and talked to "mac" and he was just as awesome.
Is everyone @ this particular one nevada credit union this amazing?
I'm now a new member!
This was the only place open midday on a sunday!
Turns out i went to hs with two of the 5 girls dancing!!
Fookin small world yo!
Refinanced a loan at this branch and they were great.
Everyone is usually easy to work with.
I have been a member of cccu for quite some time now.
I have always had pleasant dealings with the staff.
This week, i decided to purchase a new car and utilize the brokerage at cccu.
Tracy webb and richie smith made the financing and purchasing of my car simple and easy.
13 minutes ago  great place.
Quick dryers and washing machines.
They even provide free laundry soap.
Also, kelly ann is a sweetheart.
I've been banking at this location since 2005.
I love the building and the location is very convenient to my work and the south side of madison.
The tellers have always been very friendly with quick service.
I also have home and business loans through the credit union and couldn't be happier with the service.
The website banking services are also very good, including their android app for google phones!
Great staff at wf this location!
Always smiling & patient!
Complimentary water is such a nice jesture and calms me!
Drive thru doggie biscuits keep my doggies coming back!
Thanks, nichole, vicky and yaqueline.
As well as the tellers whose names i have forgotten!
See you next time!
Adi and joe always make my time there special!!
Very friendly and very prompt!!
The rest of the staff is golden!!
I've been a member for awhile and this is the best mgr and group that's been here!!
I always feel at home!!!
Thanks to all of them!!
Great company to work with.
Dave assisted with our refinance through the entire process and made himself available to answer questions quickly.
I would highly recommend working with pinnacle mortgage.
Found this place while searching for fluff and fold services on yelp & they did not disappoint.
They charge $1.78/lb for fluff and fold services & it's very worth it.
Save your time, come here & let them do the dirty work for you.
The staff is attentive & super friendly & i will continue coming here every time i need laundry done.
Thank you guys for excellent service!
Christian and the female manager have been very gracious to me.
I lost my job a few months ago and they have not treated with disdain.
Staff is friendly and if you're nice and have to tinkle, they allow you to use their facilities.
Rosita alvarez really took the time to help me out she's amazing !
And i didn't have to wait long
I also haven't had any issues with the mobile application!
Your go to place when your in for your vegas experience for men & women.
Down to earth spot
Especially honey singh she helped us opening new account and we feel  so welcome.
Not like other bank there so rude.
*********updated***********  ms. colin's called me personally and we had a nice conversation about all of my concerns.
She addressed them the best she could.
Thank you for the long time services you have provided us cccu.
******************************* we have been long long long time customers of cccu.
We have never experienced our debit card being compromised before we even received the card in the mail.
Then a few months later we learned the bank would be closing completely to switch systems.
This is a bit ridiculous.
Whether you asked permission or not.
Then we have a charge show up on our account for $-6.68 and the description says sam's club from 8/2/18.
When i called no one can tell me exactly what it means because that date was before the new system.
And furthermore we cant keep our money in a bank where we cant trust our money will be there.
They also said they have stood in line for over 2 hours since the new system.
Whoever thought the new system was going to benefit cccu was clearly sold on a wrong deal.
I enjoy that the company looks to help locals invest their income.
My lending institution for the past 13 years.
They are easy to do business with and their online app is my main connection to them.
I have had car loans and a mortgage through summit and couldn't be happier.
Great rates, superior customer service, and the right products to fit my needs.
The service is outstanding, everyone is courteous and swift.
Even if there is a line, i've never waited longer than 10 minutes for a teller.
Normally i'm in and out in 5 minutes or less.
This is my favorite boa location.
Staff is helpful and friendly.
It can get busy tho especially with all the retailers banking here.
I don't mind it because after your done there is so many food places around that area!
Mario was an amazing help!
Super clean space + very nice area!
Looking forward to using their facilities in the future!
Wash at night, less people & there's more than enough space.
I had the pleasure of being helped by marco wibowo.
I had such a pleasant experience dealing with him.
The customer service is top notch.
He answered all my questions thoroughly.
Not to mention i liked his tie.
It really caught my eye.
I will definitely be back.
Thank you marco for such a memorable experience.
Literally did the same transaction across the street at bank of america.
Because the extra person doing whatever in the back stopped to help the customer who helps them have a job.
Oh and the girl was nice and not annoyed that i was there.
Efficient and cheap service.
The dryer was working a little bit slower than expected.
Actually, the machines here are easy to use and looks to me most of them are brand new.
Friendly staff willing to help and give you advice how to use the machines in the best possible way.
The very location might not be very safe.
I mean not the shop, but the area around.
There are a lot of shady random people wandering around, asking for favors.
Just keep an eye on your clothes, bags or valuables - there a lot of homeless people around.
I preferred to stay in instead to wait outside.
I love this bank!
It's a bank, but these guys are hometown, mom & pop, old-fashioned.
Go see dan bienz for loans, accounts, anything.
You could almost walk out of there with a handshake & a loan.
Very friendly i've been banking with truwest for over 7 years i will never bank with anyone else
This isn't my favorite location.
Mainly because there is no drive-thru.
Other than that, i really like desert schools.
I highly recommend a credit union over a bank.
When i had my accounts with a regular bank there always ended up being fees.
That isn't the case here.
The tellers are personable and helpful.
I recently lost my debit card.
Stopped by and explained the situation.
They canceled my card and gave me a new one on the spot.
Total time was maybe ten minutes.
I plan to be a long time customer!
I use this credit union for its shared branching services.
Everytime i come here the service is fast, friendly, and efficient.
I have yet to encounter a long line.
I think the longest line i've seen here was 3 people.
I can deal with that!
Only complaint i have is that i wish there was more parking available.
That can be pretty annoying.
Bank has helped me with personal loans and my car loans with not so perfect credit.
Went to this location this morning to deposit a check.
The guy in front of me was flirting with the teller, stella.
He was so loud and obnoxious, i could overhear his lame game.
What a waste of time for that dude.
Anyway, the service here was good.
Stella was quick and efficient and i was on my way within a couple of minutes.
Since i didn't have much time, i opted for their wash and fold option which is not too bad.
I gave them instructions on how to wash my clothes as they tend to shrink on high heat.
They do provide the soap for wash and fold but it wouldn't hurt to provide your own.
Easy to find on google maps.
Car parks right outside for your convenience.
Husband & i arrived around 4ish on  sunday afternoon there were plenty of available washing machines to choose from.
Easy to follow instructions as well.
On my way in i noticed a sign at the front to ask attendant for free laundry powder!
Also handy to have coins.
Air condition, fans & security fyi!
Good wash & dry  btw $3-5usd will come again thank you.
I have been a member since forever.
It does have its low financing benefita.
Must part of medical or govt issued jobs.. as well as privileged members of approved vendors/establishmenrs.
Shayna keeps this laundromat clean.
This laundromat has nice machines.
Paper money can be exchanged for coins and soap can be purchased from vending machines.
This location has a drive thru, which is fantastic when you have your puppy with you.
I didn't go inside so can't tell you much about the customer service at this time.
Have a blessed day.
I took the taxi from the flamingo and had to wash about 8 pounds of clothes.
Wash was 2$ and drying is 25 cents per 10 minutes.
Including the taxi back and forth (10$ for each trip incl.
Tip) i paid 23$ for clean clothes (full suitcase).
There's a seven eleven on the corner for drinks.
Or a mcd for food.
I don't personally know any of them but it was my first time visiting there location.
Stepping in the door i saw very decor soda machines .
I had to help myself.
The atm is right next to the front desk where i was welcomed by gina .
Her very honest looking face and content smile was all i needed to feel attended to.
I almost forgot i had laundry to do !
After gina assisted me with the size machine, free soap and quarters i was at home.
It couldn't be beat a soda pop and laundry being washed as good vibes radiated , like easter sunday.
Fearing the gentleman that clocked in after her would not be as welcoming and completely kill the amazing moment..
He was getting ready for a long night..
I introduced myself and received  a smile he said his name was esteban .
He seen my mood change from completely relaxed to  uncertain.
Waiting upon the drying of my cloths.
Esteban is defiantly one of the most humble person i have ever met.
When you talk to him you almost feel a sense of inter peace.
He is very respectful and a hard worker.
While he was completing his nightly duties..
I can defiantly say he has a lot of pride for his job !!
Last and for most, my encounter was a 5.
If you don't set your expectations to high and enjoy the little things .
This might be just the place for you.
I'm rating it a 5 despite the buildings age it is all just material.
The machines work and dry fast.
Hope to see you at my favorite laundry mat in vegas.
Low rates on loans, they are my go to place for financing.
Just love these folks.
If you can get it....try em.
I'm not entirely sure how to review this place, but i'll do my best.
I've been here on a tour, and as part of a couple of events.
The small museum is probably only interesting to older kids, but worth a look for sure.
Just the museum would give you an idea of the scale and quality of the building.
Great slice of cleveland history.
I think the food is catered, but it's pretty business-meeting fare.
Kind of a strange place to review on yelp, but that's my not-very-insider insider's knowledge.
I had a great experience setting up new business and personal accounts with chase (the person, not the bank, haha).
He was super helpful and took the time to really explain everything to me.
I look forward to continuing to do business with az federal.
I am new to this credit union and i found them to be professional, kind and helpful!
Kevin and his team's culture pairs that of the d-backs.
Very giving and their customer service continues to make a difference in people's lives.
I can't tell you enough how awesome this company is and they even offer yelp deal!!!
Service was very efficient.
I was literally talking with the teller for a total of 30 seconds.
Got what i needed and got out.
I do not come here often, so take my review for what it's worth.
I had a special banking quandary that brought me to this location.
The lady who waited on me was super friendly and really went out of her way to help.
I was thoroughly impressed and appreciated that she went above and beyond to help me.
Many large corporations and organizations in this city act as if they don't need business from every day people.
I am so pleased that this was not the case here.
There was no wait and the service was awesome.
Powerful washers and dryers cut laundry time in half.
That is the only part of the bank we saw/used.
The employees here are exceptionally nice.
They seem to always be fully staffed which helps to move a long line, unlike a lot of other branches.
If you are looking for a smiling faces to brighten your day, you can't go wrong here.
My personal favorite is nicko!
Thanks for being awesome guys!
Navy federal has been nothing but amazing!
Car loans at an amazing rate compared to other banks 2-3% lower on the first quote!
Overall experience was amazing.. our hookah server kelli was extremely attentive & friendly.. the doorman angus was funny & nice..
I have been with weststar for about two years now and have  had good service with them.
I have usually gone to the branch on harmon or the branch in henderson.
Today i went to this branch on sunset and i had a very good experience.
As i entered i was greeted by aaron and she was so nice.
I had a few items of business to conduct she helped me with everything.
I have always had stellar service at this branch - the staff is  great.
This branch has wonderful and knowledgeable folks.
I have had nothing but help when it has been needed.
Very nice and clean bank.
His name was was trae and he was very attentive, extremely polite, and helpful.
The money museum at the cleveland fed is free.
A photo id is required for those 16+ to enter.
I was really impressed with the friendly and individualized welcome.
Even the two security guards running the metal detector were really friendly.
There are permanent exhibits and currently two special ones.
There was a small one with reading material on hamilton and the 1st us bank.
Then there was an installation provided by front triennial taking place all over the city in various buildings and spaces.
The latter runs till 9/30/18.
Regular hours are from 9:30p to 2:30p m-r which will make it a bit difficult for some to visit.
The museums size though makes it a good lunch time stop.
The lobby in and of itself is worth a quick stop inside.
The permanent exhibit provided information on the start of the current banking system and the two that preceded it.
**on 8/15/18 hours are till 9pm to give more people a chance to see the front triennial exhibit.
I've been coming to this chase for a while now.
On their open hrs its usually empty inside but the drive thru always has a long line.
If you don't have a card or forgot it don't use the drive up drive thru.
The ladies are slow, it takes them longer to do a transaction than parking and walking inside.
Great place to take unwanted gift cards for cash.
Fair price for card given.
Very quick service in and out
Dave recently helped us refinance our home.
He was very knowledgeable and great at communicating with us.
He answered all our questions with patience- via email and phone.
He also had the best rates and fees, and never seemed pushy like the other mortgage lenders.
I would highly recommend him.
English and spanish transactions.
Eric the manager has been great all the times i've dealt with him.
The branch manager and the account manager both went above and beyond in resolving my issue for me.
I am one happy wells fargo customer!
There is plenty of parking, several drive through lanes and they have always welcomed me upon entry.
Why not 5 stars?
They didn't wow me.
Have been a customer for years and will remain as one.
Great service, always willing to help.
I waited an hour at us bank to try and open an account and didn't get acknowledged by anyone.
But once i walked in here i got smiles from someone working with people and kevin helped me right away.
They were super nice and friendly here!
Thanks kevin and ashley for the help!
I also love the color they have to wear.
Kenny and mariah   my first time here with obc and i had to buy my husband a lap dance.
She was amazing and the gm was so helpful when one of our cyclist had a mechanical problem.
I've never felt so welcomed at a club
I love this location.
The drive thru is always quick and the staff are extremely friendly.
The location is very convenient with easy access to freeway right down the street.
Worked with dan strum on some business banking issues i had.
Very knowledgable, followed up in a timely manner, would definately go back to see him!
We set up checking and saving accounts nine months ago.
You are not dealing with robot-like staff at truwest.
They actually appreciate you.
They have great fees and and cd rates.
She helped me refinance my car and great customer service.
I would recommend that you go see her.
I got in and out fast.
The staff was friendly and helpful!
Have been coming here for many years!
And usually come on a tuesday night for there $2 tuesday drink special!
All the waitresses and bar tenders are great!
The dancers are beautiful and a lot of fun!
Over all this is a great place!
I really liked this branch.
This is the nicest banking center i have encountered by far.
The only thing i don't like is the busy location.
Traffic-wise...geez how i hate driving on maryland pkwy.
Nonetheless, this banking center is big, many pbs on duty, excellent customer service (for me at least).
Another new-to-me car, another hassle free loan from azfcu.
I actually tried desert schools fcu first who quoted me an outrageous 12% rate!
The only real drawback is that i can't pay the loan online.
Well, at least not from another bank account, my regular checking account is with chase.
On their website, all you can do is check your loan balance and make a payment from another azfcu account.
So this remains the last establishment for which i actually write a paper check.
Omg, this place is amazing!!!
The lady and gentlemen that helped me, was really helpful.
Bonus: they have fragrance/dye free products (i have sensitive skin)!
They washed my clothes exactly how i wanted!
Staff is friendly, knowledgeable and recognizes you on sight after a visit.
Sheesh, if they gave me a tootsie roll, i'd think i was back home at long island savings bank!
Almost expect george bailey to come out and save summerlin from pottersville while clarence gets his wings.
Old school service in a new school world.
That kind of feeling is rare and, dare i say: "wonderful..."    yelp 100 challenge
Had to replace my debit card due to fraud / data breach.
Much easier experience than at my previous bank.
So nice to drop into the branch and have a new card printed on site.
Sometimes there's a wait at this location but today i was in and out in 10 minutes.
The staff were all friendly and kind to me & gave me no hassle retrieving funds from my account!!
Ez in and out.
Adriana is always there to help if there is a problem or answer any questions you might have.
My washer at home was down and i needed to do my family's laundry.
Came here and redeemed the 9 minutes free drying by checking in.
I also forgot soap and was pleasantly surprised they were offering free soap.
Don't know the brand but it did the job.
I wouldn't recommend coming here late night though.
I think it would get pretty sketchy here at night.
The workers here are very nice and helpful though.
I've been banking here since 1991 in the early spring like march.
I like the service and most of the employees know me.
I have a saving account and a checking account and a debit card.
Most of the time i do drive up if i go to the branch.
But most of my banking i do via the internet.
Best show in vegas!
Parking lot is a little funky, but nothing a little defensive driving can't handle.
All the big banks today should take lessons from nb/az.
Le bôn plan pour ceux qui ne veulent pas de ruiner avec le service de l'hôtel.
Quelques minutes de marche et ôn y est .
Personnel super êt free lessive pour sa machine
Clean and very friendly staff.
Super fast free wifi.
Drove an extra 2 miles just based on reviews and worth the drive.
Would definitely come back here when i'm in vegas again!
Tv was a bonus for the kids too!
I have decided to give them my business because it was earned!
The savings account was opened because we wish to not touch this $.
They offered refinancing on my vehicle!
I'll find out tomorrow but overall, weststar's managemt team (at this location and harmon) go above and beyond.
Maleah at harmon location has been great and so has kelly c !
Thanks for helping my family with my financial needs!
The machines seem to be well maintained.
My clothes came out nice and clean.
One thing that i really can appreciate is that only 4 quarters for the dryer really did the trick.
I'm used to putting 3-4 quarters at other laundromats but it usually only gives me 12-15 mins.
The dryers here go for longer.
So i probably didn't even need 4 quarters to dry my clothes.
Also, the staff here is very friendly.
They were very helpful to customers that were not from here and from another country.
Ricky montanez was my loan officer recently.
He is a shining star in a sea of confusion.
He spent so much time explaining my options and helping me with my loan.
I feel like without him i wouldn't be in my dream house now.
I see a previous reviewer want happy with him, but my experience couldn't have been more pleasant.
Lol, after two checkins i'm already the dutchess.
Not for long i'm sure.
I've used their drive atm machine and yesterday i deposited a check at their drive thru teller.
Can you tell i like drive thrus?
Perfectly nice lady helped me.
Plenty of open washers and dryers mid day as well as seating to relax while you are waiting
After picking out my new-to-me car, i came here for financing.
They offer a 5 year loan at a minimum of 6.9% interest.
They had no problem financing the 8 year old car with 98k miles i was about to purchase.
And with the only requirement being a $25 deposit in a savings account.
Update: i have had several phishing scam emails sent to me that look like azfcu emails.
All have asked me to take a survey for $x reward.
I don't really want to dock azfcu for this, so this is more of a word of warning.
Never give out your account info!
Jose is an awesome guy that is eager to help.
He helps us with our business account and does a great job.
Very knowledgable staff and great customer service.
The location is close by so abd very convenient.
Boisson à 2$ tout les mardis!
Donc beaucoup moins cher que tout ce que vous pourrez trouver à vegas!
Sinon l'entrée sera facturée 30 dollars.
22 dollar cover for out of towners!
Then open bar from 7pm til midnight on mondays.
How can you beat that deal in vegas!!!
Wells fargo bank does a fantastic job at providing genuine customer service.
The bank teller is a true asset to your team.
She is a member of the latino community.
She is a wonderful listener and suggested a fantastic product.
The employees show passion in their job and make a difference in the community.
Thank you for a pleasant visit.
Heard this place was under new management so i decided to check it out.
Whoever they hired must know what they are doing.
The staff is friendlier, hotter and the dancers are on point.
It was always comfortable for couples, because the girls aren't super pushy, but even that has improved.
It's a party atmosphere.
Did i mention i went on ladies night and drank for free?
I already love a good 80's themed party, so their l80's night is a great idea.
Don't worry dudes, locals drink prices are good too!
My friends weren't complaining about a $4 drink this close to the strip.
Just tons of fun.
I will definitely be coming here more now!
I utilize them for their management and throughput of my trades.
Occasionally i consider some of their advice on trades but ultimately do my own homework.
$2m spread among the below funds have performed well for me.
(hfcvx) (hfmdx) (is) icfix (hjpnx)  (wiw) (a) (frsax) (whosx)
We joined heartland credit union two years ago after dealing with banks for too many years.
The associates at heartland are always friendly and very helpful.
Their online banking is super easy to use.
They do great things for the local community too.
I highly recommend banking here.
We moved recently and we were really sad to leave heartland cu.
Uw credit union hounded us,  m and i fined us, anchor sank us and summit thrilled us.
This should be your bank, ie credit union.
I met with "wissam" who is really a genuine customer service person and know how to handle clients.
I explained to him my issue and in no time he solved my problem.
Really efficient and effective customer service.
I opened several accounts at this branch, personal checking & savings as well as a business account.
Throughout he entire process, sally m. was helpful, always available and professional.
I've been to other banks, all the majors, but here i felt like more than just another random customer.
So even now, no longer a customer, i would still recommend them.
Brand new dexter machines.
Nicest folks at this bank!!
Always call me by first name, prompt service  and, most importantly, they correctly handle our transactions.
Special shout out to juan - what a nice guy!
Found this place on yelp and was attracted by the free 9 minutes of drying.
The place is clean, easy to locate and staff is friendly and prompt.
This place is a little too ghetto for me but the owner was super nice!
And you can use more than one machine at once so we got in and out of there pretty fast!
Thankfully because the cops were coming out to stop the girls from "working" yikes!
Not my neck of the woods, so it was a challenge just to find it.
So just let me tell you that it is actually located inside a grocery store (albertson's).
It has many teller windows, and have 5-6 banking staff.
So the line moves fairly quickly.
They didn't complain, just did their job.
So what can i say besides praises.
The "lost art" of customer service has been found at the wells fargo at 432 s. gammon rd!
They make you feel like they genuinely  care about and are adept and competent with your financial needs.
Thank you for leading the way in how it should be done.
I bank with confidence here and you can too!
Not sure how this branch is organized.
I needed a customer service rep but the one i needed was working as a teller.
I had to wait about 10 minutes until the teller went back to the customer service office.
In the meantime, three other  offices had employees sitting at a desk, but were not interacting with customers.
Perhaps employees who do not deal with customers should be given an office in the back out of sight.
I switched to arizona central from a big national bank 9 years ago, and i love it so much more.
The customer service is more personal, and they don't hit you with tons of unnecessary fees.
This branch is my preferred branch; everyone is really nice and friendly!
I have been to this chase several times and there's never a wait.
The clerks are always professional and courteous.
Overall, pretty good though.
Drove here due to the yelp check in offer.
I laughed when i redeemed it!
Everything you want in a laundromat.
As a bonus it is right next to fun hog ranch so had a drink while waiting for laundry.
The service here is excellent.
If you're looking for a bank with excellent customer service this is the place to go to!
Meant to review sooner!!
We recently worked with summit this past winter and bought a house this february with summit's help!
My husband and i are so glad we worked with keith and the team at summit!
Pros: -clean, accommodating facility (coffee!)
Thus club got the job done and didn't break our bank.
We were 8 guys in a bachelor party.
It started slow since we got their at 10pm.
I went nuts on the manager because we literally had no girls!
He comped us a bottle of jamesons that we didn't really need.
Every girl who showed up to work checked in with us for the rest of the night.
Everyobdy in our partyvhad at least 1 chick or 2 all night.
We got the bachelor on stage for a crazy parade of hotties rubbing him up.
Chicks were solid 8 or 9, no 10s there.
I fell in love with 2 tall girls, one black one white.
They tag teamed me, my lap was never empty.
Door to door both ways, so very easy in that regard.
If you're planning a bachelor party, this place hooks you up.
Great place to wash clothes near the strip.
I went in today and i left very happy.
I appreciate all the help and time she took.
I also didn't have to wait long to be seen.
I recommend people to come here!
Job done  friendly staff helping us newbies out.
Lots of machines available (came here monday at noon).
This group is as good as it gets.
I am so happy i made the switch to this branch.
As a business owner, i really appreciate that this team cares about me and my business.
I am very happy with the financial advice and recommendations.
As a result of my experience, i have referred others here.
Close to the strip for all those who don't want to spend additional money on atm fees!
Took my girlfriend here, had a great time.
Safe parking in front.
We had a few rounds of drinks, kicked back listened to music.
Clean, safe, staff were friendly, dancers were pretty.
Didn't do any lap dances.
Total bill was $70 with $10 tip= $80.
Happy we came here and will come back.
This place is absolutely wonderful, for all aspects and variety in sex relationship with your spouse.
They are very helpful with choosing the right products and toys to spice things up in the bedroom.
Thank you so much for all your help and answer to all our questions we had.
We will be back very soon.
Great staff and very welcoming as soon as you walk in the door too.
This bank is down the street from my house and is my go to bank.
I've done two in person transactions in the last week and have been served by priscilla both times.
She's very friendly, professional and has gotten me in and out in minutes.
The central phoenix location is great and the setup for investors and banking is really easy.
The low fees steered me here but the ease of self investing will keep me here.
Shana was an incredible and unbelievable help.
I'm from out of town and her service was just outstanding!
The lady working there is really nice and answered all of my questions without hesitation.
Free wifi is always a plus for me.
I drove all the way from summerlin just to work with marco.... he is always very informative and very helpful!
I've been to other rapid cash spots but his service is what stands out!
Very nice and professional.
Always willing to help and assist with my questions.
This is on the north end of the strip, about a half mile east of venetian and wynn.
Everything was operational and clean.
In a strip mall with a pizza joint and a mini-grocery (snacks and drinks while the laundry was going).
The staff (thanks carlos from la) was very friendly and helpful.
Patrons were friendly, too.
If the need arises again, i would definitely go there again.
But 1) it's pretty clean 2) has everything you could want (i.e.
Working machines, change, soap, drinks, restroom, chairs, folding tables and wifi).
3) yes, it has free wifi - ask for the password.
5) they are on site and nice.
6) you can have them wash if you dont want to.
Just drop off your laundry.
6) they dry clean.
What else could you ask for?
I love the community feel of our local credit union.
It is always clean, you get greeted when you enter the door and their customer service has always been wonderful.
I love the keurig machine and can't stop drinking the chai tea.
I usually take one to go!
They send invitations to lots of free community events that they hold throughout the year.
These events are great for people to better understand their finances and investments.
They have a cash boomerang program that they include members in.
The cash boomerang grants money back to the members annually (who doesn't love extra money in your account!).
I just need more banking to do now so i can get back in there for a chai!
Great service, the lady at work is really nice & free detergent!
There are many machines & it's closed to many hotels.
I don't know why people expect so much from a bank with tellers and bankers.
Roula is just the best person in banking, that i've ever met.
I had to open two court ordered restricted accounts back in may 2018.
These account are not a simple thing.
They must go through a full evaluation with bank of americas legal department.
Unfortunately, the legal department did not permit me to open the account at the time.
I returned in july 2018 with the paperwork they requested, which was difficult to obtain.
Roula remembered me and helped me out once more.
She was determined to help me and even stayed after closing time.
I appreciate her so much for dealing with the legal department on my behalf.
She was so patient and professional.
Thank you charlene for your help!!!
Will be going back and look for you soon!!!!
Keep up the nice service!!
Thank you so much!!
I like b of a, they do have a lot of atms everywhere i seem to be!
I just wish the one at fashion square took check deposits- grrrr...its only a withdrawl type atm...i dislike those...grrrrr
No complaints.....the hotel is under renovation and they removed the laundry facility...dilemma.
The woman (whose name i didn't get, drats!)
Working was so nice.
It's a laundromat, so there are different sizes of washers and same sized dryers.
They do the job.
I did my yelp check-in and got my quarter (equivalent to 9 free dryer minutes).
Next time i'm in vegas and need to wash, this is where i will come!
Gaby is the best person ever!!!!
She is fast, clear , and friendly!
Is the best brunch in vegas!
I am now the proud [and informed] owner of a roth ira!
I graduated a little over a year ago and had a ton of questions about general financing for... life!
I was nervous he would get annoyed with so many questions, but he was very patient, understandable and friendly!
We pulled in kris and sonja to help with a few things and they were equally pleasurable.
It makes me so happy to know that they care about helping me, and understand that money can be stressful.
Wells fargo is the best.
The employees are very helpful and very nice.
Every time i go in, i get lexie she's awesome with customer service and interacts with her customers.
Figuring that vegas has laundromats (hey, what town doesn't?
It's a standard laundromat, nothing more and nothing less.
The free wifi was definitely a plus!
Just get the password from the lady at the dry cleaning counter.
Interestingly, all of the instructions on the machines are in spanish.
It's a good thing that 1. my husband knows spanish and 2.
I know what "lavar con agua caliente" means, or i'd be totally screwed.
They have television, but it's also all in spanish.
If you follow soap operas, though, you'll have a ball here catching up!
When i was here there was a yelp deal for 10 free minutes of drying.
If you need to laundry in las vegas the.
This place is perfect.
A huge place with plenty of washers and driers.
And plenty of counters for folding your laundry.
The place was clean and well ventilated.
The person working the counter was very helpful and even bought back all my extra quarters when i was done.
9 minutes of free drying when you check in on yelp.
The only criticism is that i had to walk a block away to the mcdonalds for coffee.
Not much selection for coffee around here.
Amazing service and very comfortable place to go to.
Thanks to stephanie for excellent assistance given to us.
She made doing business easy.
Most specially her attitude is what any business will appreciate....awesome!
I came to this branch to open a checking account.
Angelina helped me and was very helpful and extremely kind.
She answered every one of my questions and made my experience super easy.
Help you out a bunch.
They can even set you up on a payment plan if you need it.
Never had to bail anyone out until recently and they made it so easy i was amazed.
Highly recommend these guys.
$1.75 to wash and $0.25 cents/10mins to dry, the omly extra thing i had to buy was fabric softner.
After a day riding horses on a ranch this was a perfect find to wash my clothes.
I will definatly be back if i ever need to do this again.
At the time i was there if you checkin with yelp you get free wash.
I give my deepest apologies to wells fargo!
I mistakenly posted a review of bank of america here instead of the b of a site.
I will say again, my previous review was intended for bank of america!
Frank darmo, relationship banker, has been more supportive and more helpful than i ever could have asked for.
Dealing with chrysler capital has been nothing short of a nightmare.
You've gained our trust, business and loyalty.
Always friendly and helpful.
And a variety of sizes.
Always have machines available.
Went to this location to deposit my check on my lunch break from work.
Rocco the agent has been very helpful and professional.
He answered all my questions and even gave me some tips about my account.
It was my first time going there because it's far from my house but close to my work.
I will start going to this location because of how rocco treated me and provided great customer service.
I've been banking with weststar for over 10 years.
When i call in the staff is very friendly and patient with all of my questions.
I waited to get the car and ended re applying with meliea and she was very helpful.
I would recommend this bank to anyone.
They are fabulous will work with you and help you make good decisions with your loans.
I just to say thank you morgan s
We went here after visiting the museum next door.
The two drinks each free vouchers they gave us didn't hurt.
No cover charge, and we were treated well.
The bartender and bouncer were super friendly.
It was a fun evening.
I usually would never yelp about a bank but i feel i had to.
First off, i currently bank at 3 different places and tcf has been the best by far.
Marissa helped me open my checking and savings account.
She was so helpful and friendly.
I would give it 5 stars but i think they could be a little quicker at the window.
However it is better some days than others.
Staff is always helpful and  courteous.
Will continue to bank here.
Kelly and brannon gomez works at our local wells fargo and they are the best!
We recently had a huge resident activity that wells fargo participated in by making a generous donation.
We appreciate their business and recommend anyone to use wells fargo.
Thank you kelly and brannon, we appreciate everything that you do for us at ascent at papago park!
It looks like some bosses at bank of america are reading yelp!
This location seems like they have hired another teller, and lines are moving faster.
Also, they now have a lolly pops at every window.
I had an amazing experience at clark county credit union.
Richie smith helped us buy our new jeep and stephanie deines helped us with financing at a great rate.
Why go to a dealership when you can avoid the hassle?
This wells fargo is awesome and also located in troon!
This bank is always clean and the workers are always so friendly.
It usually never gets too crowded so it is nice coming to and not having to wait in line.
It's located in a beautiful area so what's not to love?
Loved the insight of how the bank years ago was run and how it was protected from would be thieves.
Kids had a great time with the interactive material and putting their own picture on the printed money
I really like this laundromat.
Its clean, its safe, its got free wifi, and it also has vending machines.
They even held on to my clothes when i forgot them the other day.
I really appreciated that!
They both provided amazing financial information and answered all of my questions.
They were exceptional in every way.
Need some clothes washed?
They operate as a do it yourself laundromat or as a full service wash and fold.
If you are traveling through, the wash and fold service is well worth it!
They promise a turnaround time of 5 hours, but it will probably be done before that.
They are quick and efficient.
It is fairly easy to access from the strip or a bus.
The 108 or the tourist busses will drop you off at the corner of sands avenue and paradise road.
From the strip the 203 goes down sands/twain and will drop you off across the street from the laundromat.
The east side of sands is twain avenue and the laundromat is about a half a block walk.
The staff is very nice, and as i mentioned, the full service is very affordable.
Love working with the team at bill's office.
They are all very friendly and willing to work with your on anything.
I wouldn't be insured with anyone else.
:)  thanks for all you do @ bill quigley - state farm...
Excellent service, very friendly, always helpful.
I have came to them for help a few times and they were always there for me and very fair.
Scott the manager is a good man
Customer service is great.
The tellers are always very friendly and have a great attitude.
Has plenty of parking, great location and i've never had to stand in line more than 3-4 min.
Nice and clean inside, friendly teller, quick service in and out.
I have been a happy chase customer for about 10 years and they never have let me down.
Great location with very nice facilities.
Parking is super easy and there's a drive-through if you are too lazy to go inside.
Best part: indoor atm with secure entry at night (so you need your card to get in).
Always makes me feel safer.
I went here last week to activate my new debit card.
I tried to do it at the atm and then went inside to make sure everything was in order.
I walked in and there were two people being helped.
Really loved the service and loved the staff.
They are so very educational and make you feel like they care about all of your financial needs.
I've been using this branch since it opened and have never had any issues with customer service.
Everyone has always been polite and helped me with exactly what i needed.
I had a little trouble w my debit card today.
And i'm so glad that i came to this branch.
He's also the friendliest banker i've met.. and mind you, i also bank w wells fargo.
I am beyond satisfied w his customer service, skills, and knowledge in what he does!
Though i can't say much about service, i know for a fact that this bank has a great atmosphere.
While we we walked around, we needed air conditioning and found our way here.
Inside, we found a small exhibit with tons of interactive gadgets!
And yes, the air conditioning sufficed.
On a more serious note, i'll definitely be coming back here for more than just the ac.
I've banked with tcf for 2 years now.
I have had absolutely no issues with them.
Above all, tcf has the option when you sign up to opt in or out of overdrafts.
Tcf has truly been a godsend.
I will never bank with anyone else!
The rep patrick was very help and full of great info about what type of account we should open.
The place was nice and clean filled with great friendly staff
Great customer service at both the teller and the loan agent.
Do wish there were more atm's available.
Great mix of looks of the dancers, something for everyone.
Nice bank and everyone is friendly.
Amber, sue & keli rock!!
Great "small town" feel of the bank.
Have always had good service with a smile.
In fact, i drive clear across town to make sure only he works on my multiple accounts.
I need to go into branches more.
Didn't realize that there is an atm machine that can dispense denominations other than 20s.
Plus the rep was really helpful.
I needed to deposit a third party check into my account and cash it right away.
I don't do this often, but my boyfriend uses compass and there is not one compass bank  in vegas.
So, i went in with his check and asked for them to cash it.
Without any problems, they took it and gave me the entire amount in cash (based on my relationship with boa).
Also, there was no lines so it was a very fast transaction.
Brad has been my trusted insurance agent for over 15yrs.
He's insured all my vehicles and homes for my entire family.
He even assists with my family's life insurance plans.
Great follow up and customer service.
Would highly recommend his services!
This td branch can be difficult to leave by car, especially going west on queensway.
You can also expect waits on busier days around lunch and after 4.
Beyond that, the service here is good.
Everyone behind the counter seems knowledgable of products and services.
Also, like many td branches, this one has a machine that counts and sorts coins for you.
No cover unless you come in a cab and hh was free beer and well drinks til 8.
This is my favorite branch!
Emily, nora and krystin i wait for because they are so nice i always leave in a better mood.
Even when i forget my card they make me feel appreciated.
They will do what's best for you and give you honest guidance wherever they can.
If one nevada could just give us 4 hours on the weekend, just phones i would be extra happy.
If they would put a million dollars in my account they have me for life.
Great service, friendly owner's and a nice clean laundromat.
My daughter and son in law been here before on their last vegas trip.
So i came with them this time.
The atmosphere is welcoming.
I love their app and this particular branch's easy driveway right off of central ave!
I appreciate their warm welcome, fast service and extensive services.
Sometimes service can be a little slow.
This place is very convenient because it's so close to me and i utilize money gram a lot.
There's always more paperwork to sign then needed but i guess they just take a lot of precautions.
The girls are very friendly and helpful.
They never rush and always get things right.
I love coming to this club!
They love their locals and have the best happy hour!
Shaun the manager is the best!
And if you need a stiff drink kasia behind the bar is your girl!
They will take good care of you!
If your looking for a casual place to see some boobies this is your place!
I've been using truwest credit union for about 3 years.
Everyone at this location is friendly, efficient and helpful.
The services they offer are varied.
If you have an account with another credit union that participates in, "shared branching", this location participates as well.
I highly recommend this location.
We searched for a laundromat near the strip while on vacation.
Great service, very helpfull staff.
Nothing to worry about.
They got my car refinanced, went from a 30% interest rate to a 7.9%.
They did it fast and made it really easy.
Thank you one nevada you guys really made a difference in my life!
Propre, pas cher et la personne à l'accueil très sympathique.
En bonus du wifi rapide pour patienter.
Credit guard, inc. is the nations best credit repair company and i can see why.
Chances are they can save you $1000's on interest rates alone.
That being said, my son, brother and myself had an awesome time here.
When you are quoted a price for a lap or private dance, it's that price.
No surprises and no up sales, at least not in our experience.
Lucky for us it was a slow night for them so we had many girls to chose from!
I enjoyed it so much i had to extend it to a 30 minute private!
Definitely a place to visit during every vegas trip we have from now on!
Great customer service and auto rates.
Very friendly and helpful.
Was able to refinance my auto loan at half the interest rate of chase bank.
Carlos got me all set up, very happy with the service and products received.
I've had great experiences in all departments... love having a true local bank
I have banked with gateway for many years both personally and with my llc.
Gateway bank is best with customer service.
It is like going to cheers "where everyone know your name".
Service was a bit slow, but once the line was gone, i was greeted by a super friendly teller.
Unfortunately, i was told they couldn't convert my euro coinage!
Certainly not her fault, but someone should examine this.
They are so thoughtful and helpful.
Finally, gilbert road  is no longer under construction.
I living going gets for all my banking needs.
Best treatment i ever got in a bank in this world was right here.
Staff is absolutely fantastic.
On monday night have free drinks with a good deal  friendly  grils of course .
Too  bad that we have to go around to get in the store.
The club itself seems very nice good furniture  no to many holes lol it was slow night.
Maybe they need more advertisement for the monday nights.
Recently refinanced my house with golden bear capital and i'm very happy with the results.
Is this process ever fun?
But i received a great rate, no hidden fees or points, and great customer service throughout the entire process.
Would definitely use them again.
Aw yeah, my reaction when i heard they were adding a henderson branch of navy fed.
I was introduced to this credit union 5 years ago.
I was with old wells fargo, that charged monthly fee to keep my money in their bank.
So i was doing back flips when they announced that they were opening one right down on sunset.
The staff is very friendly and helpful.
They have a free coinstar type machine that deposits your spare change right into your account (with no fee).
Not to mention that they always have little perks and promotions, to make the best of your hard earned cas$h.
They offer home and auto loans and amazing rates.
Always helpful and going above and beyond this place has my loyalty.
I love my bank they are easy to access either in person or via telephone.
Golden bear capital is without a doubt one of the best company's to work with.
The staff was second to none in customer service and patience.
I would recommend contacting mr. schneider if you need a loan of any type.
He will evaluate you and proceed at your speed.
This is one of my top ten company's to work with!
I would consider it to be my lender for life.
Deja vu is my club of choice.
The girls arreee, not so impressive, but lately there have been a few.
You can tell some of the dancers use looks to their advantage.
The better looking ones are the ones who cant do a pole trick if their life depended on it.
There are only a couple that are really good and worth while.
Definately a good place to hang out.
Prices for locals are worth it considering drinks are unlimited.
I actually wouldnt mind working there at all.
As a waitress that is.
I love deja vu.
I needed to wire funds and it was quick and painless.
The lady assisting me was very friendly and helpful.
I was impressed at how quick things went and how nice all the staff was.
I have more business to do with them and looking forward to my next visit.
Cindy was absolutely lovely!
Extremely quick service, had me in and out of there regardless of the extremely long line!
Had a funny conversation about popeyes too, love that place  thanks cindy!!!!
She definitely reminded me why i love banking with one nevada!
I have had several very good experiences in this branch.
I have always been treated nicely and very professionally.
Chis godbey is a great personal banker and did a great job updating my account and doing a fed wire.
Maybe once a month.
It makes life easier.
Great customer service from danielle!
Very informative and with a welcoming smile!
I will definitely consider opening an acct here!!
I have nothing but great things to say about golden bear capital.
They locked me in a great loan rate even though i live in california.
I would happily recommend them to any of my friends looking to refinance or purchase a home.
Thank you for making the process effortless!
Today i received assistance from cindy burgoz, the branch manager of this location.
Not only was she extremely helpful with the situation i was in but she was soooo so kind.
Which was refreshing after the morning i had at other banks.
I highly recommend banking at this location.
The customer service was amazing and very helpful.
I have been with this credit union since 1988, it has only gotten better and better over the years.
People at the branches very friendly and professional.
I have been with one nevada since 2012 and i absolutely love them!
Today kathy teems was very helpful in correcting my bank account with the utmost professionalism.
Thank you kathy for being there for me.
Great place, very friendly staff, this is the place you want to come for your laundry needs.
Patron of this branch for a few years and i think they have excellent customer service.
Inside the branch and out.
I've seen some great drive thru tellers and my day and very few can hold a candle to ms. gayle.
She never has an off day.
I know i'm going to get quick and accurate service with a warm smile, greeting and farewell to boot.
Whenever i have questions, i know that she's going to know the answers and lead me in the right direction.
If you need a solid local branch with consistent drive thru service, this is your place.
I've been a member of heartland credit union for about 34 years.
Service with a smile has always been the case, and i'm never just a customer.
If your money is in a bank, you're really missing out on the credit union membership experience.
Ricky montanez was my loan officer recently.
He is a shining star in a sea of confusion.
He spent so much time explaining my options and helping me with my loan.
I feel like without him i wouldn't be in my dream house now.
I see a previous reviewer wasn't happy with him, but my experience couldn't have been more pleasant.
This has to be the most courtiest people in here.
Everybody is overly nice and very warm.
Will be back here next time i'm here.
I normally really like this bank.
Every time i go in there is no one in there so i never have to wait.
So as far as banks go i really like it its quick and easy to pay my bills.
Most recently, november 3rd we visited and the night was truly something special.
The staff was amazing, especially the special event coordinator kristi.
She went above all expectations to make our visit to las vegas special.
Kristi surprised us with a limo, waiting at our location to take us to deja vu.
As we entered the club, the general manager greeted us.
He was very welcoming and thanked us for reaching out and visiting deja vu.
The wait staff came by many times to check on us and make sure we were well taken care of.
The girls were beautiful and the club was amazing as always.
Teresa p. was helpful and informative.
I will be recommending one nevada credit union to my friends
Candice hooked me up.
Rc has lowest title loans in town.
Saved twelve hundred dollars over title max and money tree.
And the service was magical.
The best clark county credit union branch in las vegas.
Convenient location  always very clean and the employees are always happy to serve you.
That's the difference between a bank and a credit union, service, service, service.
And with better rates than a bank you cannot go wrong!
Clean, lots of machines n some local stores to browse in while u wait.
The area is a bet sketchy w/ lots of either homeless or on the verge of being homeless.
Tiffany was amazing and a pro.
So much fun and easy with all the insider tips.
It was a great time and unlimited classes are $79 for the month  i got a real workout!
The bankers here are very efficient and incredibly patient.
I had to fix something in one of my accounts and jeanette was thoughtful, thorough, and on point.
On the other hand, the other banker joe was also patient and efficient.
This is a nice, clean branch with a safe atm entrance for those late night runs.
My only complaint is that the music in there is boring.
Obviously used by worldwide visitors.
Bill changers.and detergent dispensers readily available.
Go during the daytime hours as there are some questionable individuals loitering outside.
All in all, would recommend to others.
I love working with gateway bank!
A community, local bank is the way to go.
All of the staff at gateway are extremely helpful and friendly whenever i call or walk in.
They are always willing to go the extra mile to answer my questions, and make us feel welcomed and appreciated.
Example of awesome customer service: i had a meeting one afternoon to go down and discuss some accounts.
Banking can be unpleasant and stressful unless you've got people on your side who want to help you succeed.
They have high standards, but they're down to earth.
I highly recommend gateway bank for your everyday, or business banking.
The workers were very professional and friendly.
Everyone greeted me with a smile and made me feel very welcome.
They answered all of my questions and had me leaving confident on my choice of credit union.
I cannot imagine why this location only has three and a half stars.
This location has a drive-thru atm and seems to be kind of hidden in the grocery store parking lot.
Not only are both these women super smart witty and beautiful they are understanding and really care about my situation.
I have a decent amount in my savings however my credit is horrible.
One nevada has a great program that is free of charge to help you build your credit.
I felt amazing leaving this location and speaking to these women.
Process was very simple and they ladies were very helpful!
Got a loan within 25 minutes i highly recommend.
Thank you yvonne :)
Teresa salas is the best!
She always helps us and is so sweet!
She has the best personality!
I'm the first to review this branch?
Maybe that explains the complete lack of lines to do my banking!
This is a business bank, so you won't hear the ubiquitous "how's it going?"
Instead, your banking will be done quickly and professionally, leaving you to make the day your own.
If you're looking for something completely different from the bofa, wells and chase mosh pits, look no further.
Walk in, say hello, do your business and leave within a minute or two.
A very cool free attraction in the heart of downtown cleveland.
After passing through the security check at the federal reserve, one can only admire the beautiful ceilings inside this building.
After a little architectural magic, the next attraction is the small, but interesting, money museum.
It's free to visit, and is very informative for people of all ages.
Obviously, being a complete child, i took advantage of the latter (photo to follow).
The availability of service is great.
My schedule's hectic and i come take care of laundry on my time only.
The room to improve definitely comes from the riff-raff who frequent the area.
I might suggest coming in the daytime for those ladies traveling alone.
I hear they're working on this...
The other things that keep me coming back include the tasty burritos across the parking lot .
If you like tasty burritos and clean clothescome to this strip mall and you shall receive them!
The foundation that i am a vice president of uses this bank.
The service is phenomenal and the fees are low.
They will really go the extra mile to help you out!
If you have a business or non-profit organization, i highly recommend arizona business bank!!
Free soaps... quick dryers.
Check in with yelp for some free dryer time ...
The customer service here is amazing!
Their staff is friendly and very outgoing.
Great customer service, timely, quick and efficient.
Not much to say, just a very straight forward bank with incredibly nice people.
First, their customer service is top notch!
I received a call from visa fraud prevention about sketchy purchases made on my visa debit card.
I hadn't even noticed anything was wrong yet--they were so on top of it!
Then one charge was for a groupon.
Nicole called me, then waited on hold with me while groupon figured it all out to get me a refund.
I have been a customer for 21 years, and i will likely be a customer for life!
We went in to do some stressful estate work after a family member passed and abraham went above and beyond.
He was so considerate and helped us with tasks that many others would have pushed away.
He gave the best service of any banker i have dealt with in years!
This location offers a great customer service team, from management down.
The employees do not mind having a friendly, casual conversation either.
I never feel displaced or bothersome.
My only gripe is the location of the drive through atm.
Sometimes it is too hard for me to see the screen depending on the location of the sun.
Maybe i just need to be taller or need a bigger car so i sit higher up.
(i originally had this review under the wrong oncu location.
I've been to this club a few times.
First of all it is a safe environment, very clean and not sleazy at all.
Another good thing is that it's not expensive at all.
20 dollars to enter, nevada residents come in for free.
On tuesdays they do drink specials.
Wine is only 2 dollars.
On regular says it is 12 dollars which is a normal price for las vegas.
The staff is very friendly and professional.
Girls are not pushy at all.
Except one older lady who is always there.
She wouldn't take no for an answer and ended up being irritating.
In my opinion, she doesn't belong there.
The girls are nice looking , in all shapes and sizes.
No pole tricks though which is a little bit disappointing to me as a pole dancer.
I don't blame them though, the audience seems to be a little cheap.
I took their my boyfriend because it is very couple friendly.
Monica was very helpful and informative.i was very happy with the way the staff treated me.
They took great care and fulfilled what i needed!
This place is clean and cheap.
Neighborhood seems sketch but i grew up in a neighborhood like this so i'm used to it.
Definitely come early, lots of washers few people.
Just a short walk from my hotel so i decided to check it out.
It's free so why not?!
The museum is short but it's wonderful!
She was super informative and i learned so much in my short visit.
It was well worth the walk over.
Never has any lines they are quick and saves me a lot of time.
I also have an auto loan here that gave me a lower rate than my main bank by 5 percent.
I would keep all my assets here if they were open on saturdays.
Staff where very friendly and helpful.
I like pnc bank as it is a real people friendly bank.
Like this branch especially as it is big and lots of employees.
This will be my go too branch from now on.
I love coming to this bank!
Lines are minimal and atm is in and out.
The tellers are nice and the facility is clean
Very polite professional staff weather in drive threw or in side of store.
Better then boa any day
I regularly frequent this branch and absolutely love it.
I highly recommend the bank and this branch!
I did give a bad review a while back.
However, after some time, things got back on track and i paid off my loan.
Things went well and i felt good about using their services again.
Interactions were professional, no harrasing calls, just the typical calls you get from any lender or collector.
Messagas were professional and respectful.
End of the day, we're all imperfect and sometimes we have bad days but respect is key on both sides.
You have to give it to get it.
I do recommend using las vegas finance.
Not sure why they only have one star on here.
If you're a cccu member this place is great.
Fast and easy and the staff is very friendly.
Do be aware you have to be a member to use this credit union.
Probably the wells fargo bank in las vegas that i hit the most.
Mainly because it's closest to my home.
I rarely need to go inside the bank unless i have to transfer money to someones account.
My visits here are either the walk up atm or the drive thru.
This is one of the most convenient atms for me since there's never a line.
My only issue is the withdrawals through the drive thru atm.
On the drive thru atm, if you withdraw more than $100, they give you $50's instead of $20's.
Some places early in the day cannot break $50's (i.e.
Starbucks, fast food drive thru's, friends, etc).
By the way, why do people call it an "atm machine"?
Doesn't atm mean automated teller machine?
In actuality, these people are saying they need to get money from an automated teller machine machine.
Just like pin number???
Things that make you go hmmm.
This is a great location.
Rarely busy and amazing staff.
Everyone is friendly and helpful and it seems like they know most of their clients by name.
The bank itself is well maintained and bright.
Very convenient to the 215.
I wanted to say a big "thank you"!!!
To "cory burd" at the tenaya branch and "troy seay".
Both of these guys were fantastic in the purchase of my new cadillac.
They were quick responsive and answered all my questions completely.
I've always used cory in the past for my car purchases and he's been wonderful.
This was my first time to use troy and he was just as good.
Thank you again for all your professionalism!
Clean, what more can you want from a laundromat.
The clerk was friendly, the machines worked and i came out with clean clothes.
Wonderful service with an awesome staff!
Always willing to assist..... with class,and a smile!
Everyone at this bank is so helpful!
They are always kind and willing to help you!
The branch manager joanne is a wonderful woman!
I would recommend coming here if you want friendly service and assistance!
I've read some other reviews here, but i wanted to say that my experience has been really very good.
Thank you patty & macu!
Update on experience...supervisor called my husband to apologize and wanted to keep our business.
Great job weststar but can't give full 5 stars because of the stress we went through beforehand.
This credit union is amazing!!!
There is never a long wait and the tellers here are amazing!
She is very upbeat and always has a smile on her face.
She is my go to teller from now on!
Its also nice that we share the same name!
I highly recommend this credit union!!!
Everyone go open an account with ssscu you wont regret it!
The teller was equally friendly and helped me through a slightly tedious banking issue.
It's nice to know that people are friendly wherever you go.
Will definitely come back to this branch as it's very close to my new apartment.
Jim was very professional and explained the process thoroughly.
No hidden agenda just straight quality service.
I've used pinnacle mortgage twice now and caroline morton had been my representative both times.
She is great at her job and is eager to help and makes getting a home loan seamless.
I will definitely use pinnacle and caroline in the future if i need another home loan.
Update: she's helping me and i'm sorry for the bad review.
Misunderstanding cindy is very nice and helpful...
So much better than wells fargo!
Customer service is outstanding.
They don't rip you off in fees.
I go there often and have had nothing but excellent service.
They are also open on sundays which is awesome.
Great for a local close to home credit union - which is perfect for me.
I use this for my small business.
That is the only time i need to go into the bank b/c i use the app to deposit checks.
Everyone is friendly - great customer service - and that outweighs the atm.
We have been here for several years.
They are always helpful, usually no waiting at all for tellers, less than 10 minutes for personal in depth help.
Recently ellen was very helpful in explaining options in regard to my credit record.
The loans rates are very competitive, and we have always transferred car loans to here after purchase.
-1 star for overall cleanliness and a widow pane missing.
Thankfully it's only noon and i got my hubby by my side!
Cynthia and adriana were great with customer service!!
I can easily get my banking done on my lunch hour, which is no easy feat.
I cashed a government cheque and divided it between getting cash back and deposting into various accounts.
The entire process took around 16 minutes!
It could be because it's so big and they staff enough tellers to deal with the rush.
Whatever the reason, it's my rbc of choice.
Also, since the whole building is rbc, there are atms all over, including in the underground path.
This chase has the best service.
Super sweet and helped me figure out a few things i had questions on.
Happy customer right here!
I usually frequent the windmill location, but this location was more convenient for me on this day.
My only regret since switching from chase to here is that i didn't do so sooner.
This location is very similar to the other ones i have been to in town.
The interior is very clean and the tellers are always helpful and friendly.
It's nice to have another location on the west side of town to go to whenever it's necessary.
I'm definitely a fan!
We just opened an account at cccu.
Very easy and great member benefits.
They have amazing mortgage services.
How see brent the branch manager!
It is what it is...not the worse place but if you need a place to do laundry here you go.
Lots of washers and dryers but the dryers are harder to get.
Luckily i got one right away but only needed one.
Attendants on duty so that's good and they are friendly and helpful.
Place is relatively clean too.
Check in here on yelp and get 10min free drying time.
This seemed like a great solution - and it was!
About a 15 minute walk from the convention center monorail station it was painless to find.
Staff was friendly and helpful and provided free detergent!
What more could you want?
Great hours, the staff is very helpful and patrons are friendly.
Someone even paid for my dryer.
Very very good they work with you fast have not a hassle with them.
I've been late on paying, they work with you quick must try very very professional!
Phoenix super made keith have a super birthday!!!!
Gigi and jessica were so sweet made up feel comfy and they are all so beautiful.
Come and ask for these  beautiful ladies to host your night!
I was treated courteously.
There was a coin machine but i think that they did away with that.
I have been using nevada state bank for a non-profit for which i serve as treasurer.
The customer service and ease of using online tools have been fantastic.
Ask for joey f. when you go into this branch, he's the best to work with!
Absolutely a great alternative to the hotel equivalent.
Our service was prompt, professional and affordable.
We paid by the pound for the wash and fold.
We found our clothes clean, smelling good, and neatly folded.
The location, while close to the strip, is not the best.
Use common sense and you should have no problems.
Not a bad branch..
The staff is friendly and usually around to help if they aren't being bombarded by another ssscu member.
A bit out of the way for my taste, but the ease of banking with them always brings me back.
Location is nicely maintained and you'll find they offer free coffee often.
Can't get in the door without someone greeting you.
Easy to get to and parking is not a problem.
I usually go to this wells fargo since i moved here.
It's inside the albertsons and i love shopping there.
The workers at this wells are super nice and they make conversation with you.
They also do their best to remember you and what you talked about last.
Sometimes the line is super long but it's ok :) the workers make it worth going back.
I went to another location off of cheyenne and they aren't as friendly.
They have 2 atm's out between the postal service side and the branch itself.
Due to illness i had to take over my parents accounts at nsb.
I stepped right into a big mess and needed guidance and help more than once.
I can't tell you how many times i had to call laura for help.
She always called me right back and went above and beyond to help me through every situation.
She made me feel like  i was her only customer.
I'm so thankful for her and would recommend her branch to anyone looking for that small bank experience.
Had a great experience at this branch last week.
They offered me a great deal on my auto loan  refinancing.
Went from 7.75% to 2.49% so i will be saving $$.
Thank you ron, dina & amber.
You guys are the best !!
Awesome laundry attendant, shana was very helpful and courteous.
They laundry area was very clean
Came back here with my boyfriend last week after  like 7 months break and it is still solid 5 stars.
We had drinks and dances and everybody was nice from the staff to the girls.
I'm an ex entertainer and definitely know what is good and what is bad.
Always have a great time here and bring friends.
Working with david taylor from pinnacle mortgage solutions was a great experience.
Very satisfied with david's service and will be recommending him to friends and family.
We have had brad dunlap for over 20 plus years.
Been throught a storm that tore some roof off.
And many other incurance need.besides personal caring attentive service!
We recieved clames, money, help.
Paid withing 48 hrs.never!
Have had bad service.
He has and his staff are always prompt.to help!
I have referd all friends and family over the years.best agent we have ever!!
We live at other end of town...and he drives to our house to service our needs.above and beyond!!
Look forwrd to many more years!!
Ok, so how do you give a review of a bank, let alone a good one?
Perhaps this should become another one of those.
"oh why don't you go and bank yourself" or "i got totally bank-faced last night!"
Words that all lead you in the direction of a great night ahead!
This is a new bank, clean and simple, chock full of young and keen staff.
The attitude is similar to being greeted at an earls or a beach hotel somewhere warmer than calgary.
They have an open door policy with their account managers so there generally isn't a need to book ahead.
The tellers are mostly keen to be there and the account managers always have a smile on their face!
Oh, and the best news... they are open late and they are open saturdays!!!
If you live or work in the beltline, it's time to change banks!
This is by far the best laundramat that i have ever been to.
I use them exclusively for their wash and fold service.
This is typically done with a four hour guarantee, and they are open 24 hours a day.
Keon jay, who works behind the counter, always takes good care of me.
He and the rest of the staff will wash your clothes according to your preferences.
This establishment also offers self service laundry machines and dry cleaning.
In my opinion, the parking lot can be a shady place (e.g.
But i consider it worth going to this shopping center because this laundramat is so good.
Shana gave awesome service!
She is great i hope management sees this!
The laundromat is very clean and i like the free soap helps alot
The flamingo branch is my regular banking location.
Ive been banking with onenevada since 2013 and only recommend them to....everyone.
Reasonable rates, easy free online access and allpoint atms are what keep me banking here.
Did i mention boa?
Evil, just plain evil.
Esteban who works at night has the place has it very clean.
Very friendly and has the best customer service ever.
It's by far the best place ever.
Cindy was very helpful and had a lot of patience assisting my parents and i!
I recommend this branch very much!
Only used the atm so i didn't interact with anyone.
The machine gave me the money i needed so i was more the pleased!
Always a good experience at chase!
I have never been to a bank where they work thru the line so quickly.
The tellers are friendly and effective.
There is always a candy bowl filled with something good.
Live it up, you are in las vegas for cryin' out loud!
I've been a member of the credit union since i started working in the health care profession.
The service is beyond friendly and the staff is always attentive and eager to help.
The only gripe i have about the credit union is well... thats its a credit union !
I know that sounds kind of crazy but i miss some of the conveniences you have with a larger bank.
Ohhh, and the dividends don't hurt either !
I love navy federal.
I have had accounts with other banks, and nfcu is by far the best.
They have great customer service and have helped me out with any financial issues.
I went in today to get approved for a loan to consolidate everything.
It took a lot of work and time, but jessica cadenas helped me out, which is greatly appreciated!!
I introduced my husband to them, and he loves it as well.
Definitely use this branch.
Great service, great people.
Also can't beat their interest rates for loans.
This location is a bit confusing when you walk inside.
In front of you is a waiting area, to the right, are personal banker offices.
If you walk towards the left there is a hallway you must go down to get to the actual tellers.
The staff is very helpful, kind, and warm.
I love bank of america products and services.
Very personable and very willing to help me in all areas of banking and credit repair.
I, hands down will recommend this bank to all my friends and family
Golden bear capital is a great company to work this.
The staff was very knowledgeable and answered all my questions.
Mr schneider was also great to work with.
Cheap place to wash. wifi works fine.
A lot of machines so there's always room to grab a machine and wash your dirty clothes.
The attendant at the counter is very friendly and helped when needed.
Vince helped me out and did a awesome job   very professional and courteous   exceptional service
Fun place and ricky rae is awesome.
As well as mellissa our server
Been with these guys for over 10 years and have also had wells & bofa-weststar tops them all!
Interest rates are low, great customer service and they don't cut off a limb if you ever have an incident!
The branches are always clean, you're in and out on all banking errands, no craziness.
Very helpful employees and awesome interest rates on car loans!
They have bankers who actually ask questions and help you.
This credit union isn't just about making money, they're about helping you.
This has been one of my banks for about 5 years.
The hours and days open has been cut back, but it doesn't affect me.
The lobby is great, and rarely is there a line.
When there is a wait the tellers are quick to thank you for waiting.
Kellianne is the bomb.
I came in from california, realized i forgot to do my laundry.
Kellianne to the rescue!!
Quick, i used the "beast" $6.50 machine.
Glad i found this place.
What a relief not having detergent, what do ya know with the $6.50 wash comes "free deteregent"!!
We do all our banking with desert schools and have been very pleased.
On july 25 we switched our auto loans there so we can have everything with them.
He kept following up with me everyday to make sure all was right and ready.
So now we don't have to mail her payment anymore and can do everything on line with desert schools.
He has a great personality and a joy to work with.
We have been with desert schools since we've moved here and been very happy with the service of this branch.
Super efficient, friendly spot.
Free coffee to boot.
Stopped in over lunch to wire funds in escrow and was in-and-out in less than 10 minutes.
Brad has handled my insurance for over 10 years.
I know him, i trust him, and have recommended him to my friends and family.
I opened both checking and savings account online using their website.
It took about ten minutes for me to answer a few questions regarding my income, and i was approved.
According to the representative, i had ten days to add funds to both accounts.
Good thing i had the money or both accounts would have closed down.
I didn't have to wait too long for someone to help me.
Linda provided a business card in case if i have any more questions or issues.
I do appreciate everything that linda did for me.
It is a great place to wash your cloth on the road.
The price is much better than hotel.
It is a super busy place, but the people are still very nice and do their best to help.
I'd have to agree with jane!
I've been to dozens of bank of america locations, but this one has the best service by far.
This is by far the best strip club i have ever been to.
The club is huge, plenty of seating for everyone and good amount of seating up near stage.
The lighting was gental, the environment clean and tidy and the seating was very comfy.
The stage was smallish but the ladies put on a great show for all to see.
I remember i tipped very conservetively and that day and what i got out of it was a great experience.
I had my face planted in boobage so much that day it was wow.
Plus it was great to see how the ladies showed their gratitude towards the lesbians in the crowd.
The two of them interacting was a show all by it self.
Sure i was asked many times by the ladies to go to the back rooms but i had to decline.
When i did they were very polite about it.
There were adult store out front too, but i didnt go in.
I wasted 30 bucks that way but i think that was well spent anyway.
Tall cute boy with dimples david was sooo helpful.
Great customer service he is a keeper!!?
When i went in to open my new accounts i was assisted by the branch manager.
Not only was she knowledgable on the different options i could select she was very friendly.
She greeted every person that walked in the door with a smile and a welcome.
I'm glad i selected this branch to bank with.
Here for a large business meeting and needed to find a clean, well-managed place in a safe neighborhood.
I found that and more with 24-hour twain.
Good machines, clean bathroom and well-stocked with detergent, etc.
Eddie and shana are super nice people and helped me out to make it all easy.
Steve b - nyc
She followed through to ensure my purchase was taken care of before going on vacation the very next day.
Also, they offered me the best interest rate compared to the other banks wanting my business.
I would say if you are looking to purchase a new car, give misty a call!
Thank you so much misty for all of your help :)
Staying as a guest for a week on business at the orleans, i needed a laundromat at night.
The hotel sent us to a ghetto neighborhood originally in which we were approached by thugs asking for money.
We searched online and found this laundromat.
The attendant, claudia, was super friendly.
Clean facility, safe neighborhood and great service.
The vibe is laid back and fun.
Doing inversions is really really hard!
And those spins aren't as easy as they look either.
5 stars all the way
We went for a bachelor party on a saturday.
But with me who had never been to a stop club before, i wasn't sure want to expect.
Especially since i really don't care for the idea of it.
I was very pleasantly surprised.
Starting out slow and getting the hookah service was a great way to start.
Some of the dancers really hit the spot, and some were average.
But with the variaty of girls that showed up, there was someone for everyone.
Most importantly though our waitress, suzette really made the night.
She made sure to check in on us regularly, never let our drinks run dry and was amazingly nice.
And that's what really made the difference.
I only spent $100 for 4 hours at the club including limo ride there and back.
I love this one nevada location.
Awesome awesome customer service
My wife and i banked at b of a for years.
Then we noticed that they were getting bigger and bigger and dipping their fingers in all different kinds of enterprises.
It reminded us of that movie "the international" from a few years back.
We grew disgusted with everything that they stood for.
Which is why we started banking with desert schools.
Switching all of our direct deposits and auto-debits was actually easier than i thought.
Desert schools has also made some technological strides even in the few years that we've been banking with them.
They have a great mobile app and their atms accept the envelope-free cash and check deposits.
I initially thought it was fraud, so i called desert schools to inform them.
Just moved into the area so i think i found my new branch of choice!
Not only was the entry free but so was the limo ride.
We then were seated by derrick, he got us the best seat in the house!
We spoke with matty and he gave us an awesome deal!
Brianna set our table up and even poured our cocktails!
They have a huge variety of dancers, our favorite was love.
Her stage show was amazing.
We had such a memorable time we will definitely be coming back!
Brianna was amazing and we'll never forget her beautiful smile.
Thank you so much for a great night!
I had the opportunity to meet with scott today.
He was professional to say the least.
So courteous, nice and sweet yet made me feel like i was at home.
I'm glad i chose this company to go to for a loan.
He was so very helpful and went above and beyond is call of duty of customer service thanks again scott
Close by the strip.
Pack light so you can fill up yr suitcase with all your shopping delights!!
Thank you ana for being so helpful.
Love the added bonus of 9 mins of free dryer time with check in.
I regularly frequent this branch and absolutely love it.
I highly recommend the bank and this branch!
I found this laundromat on yelp.
I drove to the laundromat wasn't that far away.
Inside was amazingly huge.
Clean orderly and not busy at all.
This was a saturday morning at 7:30 am.
I will definitely remember this place the next time i'm in las vegas.
The ladies are nice and not snobbish.
Wish i would've went to rapid cash before the other stupid loan place i went to.
Had a such a great time w/tracy...
Took pole dancing classes w/ our bacrolette party and we had a blast!!!!...
Tracy was patient and embraced us all..
Even us curvy  girls....most definitely will be back!!
She walked me through step by step on the process of how to handle my account.
All in all linda was a perfect example of someone providing excellent customer service.
Carlos used to keep on top of all the machines and their issues.
He could stop them and reset them.
Not all the machines get hot water.
Carlos knew how to make the hot water go in.
The girls are nice and if you complain they will give you money to wash again.
I'm picky about laundry though.
The people that work there are super nice, and they're always cleaning.
With the volume of people in and out of there, they do a good job.
Shana was so helpful and sweet!
Very calm presence and would immediately help and address any of my questions.
During my time here, i watched her interact with all the customers with a smile and promptness.
I was thoroughly impressed with her ability to manage the laundromat by herself throughout the rush of customers.
Although the laundromat is not brand spanking new, it feels safe and clean and no mildew smell.
Thanks x 1000 girl, coming back to this laundromat next vegas trip.
I'd like to give a big thank you to julio t. at this boa location.
My girlfriend was having problems with an unnamed but nearby competing bank that has been treating her poorly.
Julio is very knowledgeable about many of boa products and services.
We got everything we needed done in a quick and efficient manner.
Julio could not have been nicer.
If your tired of crap from wells fargo (oops) come over to boa.
Best customer service you'll find at a financial institution!!
Everyone is especially helpful, friendly, kind, patient and professional!
Love this credit union!
Everyone is very friendly and helpful.
Of course, they're a credit union so their fees are minimal.
Only use the atm, atm is always stocked, clean, no graffiti or scratches, plus it's convenient.
You can drive up anytime, open 24 hours.
I can only speak for the tailoring service, so take that into consideration on this review.
I brought in two pairs of slacks and a dress for mending on a friday afternoon.
That's a quick turnaround, nice!
I've waited to review because i wanted to see how the mending held up to wearing and washing.
All i can say is high-five!
I'll be heading back for my tailoring needs.
It was really easy and fast!
I bought a monkey lunch bag for my brother.
They are super cheap, and worth the smiles)
The girls here all seem to be going to college, very ambitious along with being very attractive and young.
But, i can deal with that.
The drinks are expensive, so save your money and give it to the girls.
You're investing it in the future of our country.
I'm not sure when exactly they went topless but the alcohol is always a bonus.
I first found out about pinnacle mortgage solutions on the bankrate website.
From then on, smooth sailing; just necessary documents being requested and sent.
Dave is very prompt in answering questions via phone/email.
The best part of the whole experience, of course, was the rock bottom settlement charges for a loan over $400k.
In short, low key, and the best price.
I am usually here for a week and i come in all 7 days for her .
She is not only beautiful but also very honest and sweet .
She is not pushy at all.
I  can not wait for my next trip to go in and see erin.
The staff is always professional and courteous.
I have used both their fluff and fold and dry cleaning services and have never had one.
Services are completed in a timely manner and at a great price.
Plus you can't beat the 24 hour service!
My "go to" branch because they are open late until 7 and also on weekends!
I had a very straightforward refinance with excellent credit and a loan amount less than 60% of the appraised value.
To my mind, this situation is about as easy as it gets.
Pinnacle quoted me the best rates by nearly a percentage point and the closing costs were rock bottom.
As other reviewers have said, he responded to emails promptly and everything went off without a hitch.
Pinnacle will not actually be servicing my loan, so it is yet to be seen how well that goes.
Hopefully it also goes well.
After some recent changes with our careers, she had stumbled upon cccu through work.
She looked into it and we decided to give it a shot and we couldn't be happier with the results.
The amount of services provided by this credit union is astonishing.
It truly is a one stop shop for all your banking needs and then some.
The best part is, it's all done in house.
What really impressed us was the service we were provided by teller gina and branch manager ron.
Everything was transparent and the process was seamless.
Any questions we had were answered with the utmost detail.
The wonderful lady that help me open my new account she was witty and quick, i honestly enjoyed my visit.
I had a great experience so i believe people have just had them on their bad days.
I have had an incredible experience with cccu.
Evan pierce, the loan officer that helped me with my auto loan, was absolutely amazing.
I submitted an online application and he called me less than 5 minutes later to start finalizing the loan.
Evan was very communicative and understanding throughout the entire process.
He got all of the paperwork together that i needed to sign and called me when it was ready.
It only took 10 minutes to sign my loan documents and get the check.
Travis helped me open my savings account to become a member, and he was also wonderful!
Overall, i've had a great experience with cccu and i highly recommend them for their rates and customer service.
I always get special attention because i am a premium plus or something.
I get to avoid lines when i come in if i tell the greater how great i am.
The people here are very friendly, even if they keep forgetting when they last saw me.
I don't want to call anyone out, and it really isn't a big deal.
It has that small bank feeling, but has speedy service.
The manager aaron was so friendly and helpful, we were in and out within 5 minutes.
If you're looking for a wells fargo this location is definitely worth going out of your way for
Very clean and new machines.
A lot less crowded than a few places south.
I like not having to exchange money for a bunch of quarters.
I couldn't get the wifi to work.
It connected, but had no internet.
These folks were amazing.
So polite, and only one of many times that i've been in there did i have to wait at all.
It only ended up being 3 minutes, possibly less.
The first time i was in there, i was opening a checking and savings account.
It was a breeze.
She even photocopied and sent some paperwork for me to another branch.
Something that had nothing to do with why i was in there.
That's the extra mile that people want to see.
Another time i came by, was to open an account for my son's birthday.
Being only one one year old, i need to be the one controlling the account.
I didn't have any clue what to do, but the lady helping me was spot on.
She even linked my account to his so i could transfer straight to it.
Thanks a lot oncu.
A nice laid back place especially for locals who don't need the fast paced clubs for a good night.
Ask for mariah she's an angel, amazing dancer both on stage and for personal dances.
Thanks again linda for all the help!
Was really impressed with the staff here, knowledgeable and friendly plus they gave me very competitive rates for their products.
Came into rapid cash and had an amazing experience!!!
Daisy was very helpful in every kind of way.
She was very polite and has a great personality and also very professional.
What great customer service!
Was there on wed night.
Via was super cool and a body to match.
That girl's a star.
The place and staff were chill and not pushy.
Yes yes and yes.. so duhhhhh switched the accounts that we had.. that is the business side.
Lisa was like a breath of fresh air.
Thank you for the excellent services.
Not only is this business absolutely affordable, it's so clean!
They're full service too, which is cool.
Free wifi is awesome, nice vending machines, and their ac actually works!
I did feel safe in here at night, which us also tough to find here on the east side.
This is my new laundry spot!
Agree with the review below me.
I've become a regular at this location because of the asst.
So helpful, caring, and always willing to go out of his way to help me and the other clients.
Love the whole branch in general.
Everyone is always in a good mood, greeting me as i walk in and always have smiles on their faces.
Definitely the #1 bank in my opinion.
Had to replace a lost debt card, experience was fast and easy.
Alex is pretty awesome too!
I love how this location has 2 24 hour access atm's, one drive up and another walk up.
The line at the drive thru even on fridays around 5pm has never been more than 3 cars long.
Always a pleasant experience.
Well read the other reviews of this bank.
They are not good.
However, i have always had a very good experiance here.
True they are spread out,not too close to where i live or work.
However, you can do a lot on line.
I have been in here several times and always had good customer service.
Maybe i am lucky i never had to deal with mrs.
Torres.....they at this time will give you a $100.00 if you open an acct.
Very much like chase.
I have referred 2 people and they have been happy with there change.
Look into them and give them a try, maybe you too will like it.
I have been a member at this credit union since i was 6 years old.
As an adult, it is the only place i'd prefer to keep my money.
They are very transparent and strait forward during a era of sketchy business practices.
I always think of them as chinese finger traps).
They have become my life savers ever since i became a member.
They know me as the fueler.
Great people and a great credit union.
Great experience here with ajay.
Incredibly helpful customer service.
Helped resolve all our issues.
Tips:  don't pay cabbie.
Cabbie gets paid by club.
Get coupon book, you can get 10 off 30 cover.
Be aware you have to by one 10 coke.
Place is nice, with strippers that go full nude.
+  the girls keep asking if you want a lap dance.
-  some decent looking girls.
+  i recommending sitting right by stage.
If you don't get a lapdance def sit by the stage.
Some stripper took my friends glasses and put it over her cuka....
I hid my glasses for the rest of the night.
-  i got titty slapped.
+  1st time at stripper club success!
Kierstin did an amazing job today!
Very efficient and attentive.
Resolved my issues without skipping a beat!
Really friendly and great customer service.
Willing to go the extra mile for the customer.
# to the budget traveler: this museum is completely free and wonderful.
I know, at first sight you may think: a money museum!!
Could there be anything more boring!!!
In other words, they are all different.
Some are just standard office building, others grand secure safes.
This one in cleveland is a work of art.
When we first walked in we were treated with the typical security that you expect at a federal reserve.
Although it was not as bad as any airport security.
This was followed by a professional tour that made me notice elements of art and gun shooting (i.e.
Security) stations that i would not have noticed on my own.
This is a great place for kids and adults alike.
I learned a lot.
I made my own money both electronically and with paper and crayon.
I felt like a child again and i was surprised at how fun it was.
And before you leave you get a nice set of souvenirs.
The best one is probably the bag of shredded money.
Went on a monday night and it was better than expected.
Still great for price n ride.
Good music good hospitality.
Will def go again next time i'm in vegas.
Just happened to end up at this bofa branch after running some errands in this part of las vegas.
Which was great for me, as waiting in line is something most people would prefer to do less of.
This is what all the tellers should be doing, and she did it very well.
But the entire process was quick and efficient, and service was provided by friendly staff.
So easily 4 stars.
If i am in the area and need to step inside a bofa branch, i will definitely pick this one.
Lots of modern front loading washing machines.
Money changers exchange paper money for quarters.
Then the branch manager, ron, met with me personally to ensure i was taken care of.
You just don't get that level of service at most places, let alone banks.
Very friendly attendants working at this laundromat and this place has the added bonus of free laundry soap!
It's busy but there are a lot of machines.
Wish i had this level of service back home!
Used this bail bonds to bail out a loved one.
I just want to express how efficient a hope bail bonds is.
Jim is very professional and personal he makes you feel like he's know you for years.
Matt is also very pleasant to speak with.
The service provided was quick.
The person i had bailed out got a quick release due to this bailbonds.
I would use them for future.
Thanks for making things easy and quick.
Ciara is f*****g amazing!!!
She's gorgeous and a total sweetheart!
She made our night so much fun!!
My sisters bought me lap dances for my birthday and we kept going back for ciara.
We were visiting from seattle but i'll definitely include this again next time i'm in vegas!
Had to do laundry while on vacation and found this place on yelp.
The ladies who work here are very helpful and friendly.
It is kept clean and there are tons of washers and dryers.
Macu is a great credit union to bank with.
They always have great low rates on everything from auto loans to credit cards.
The employees that work there are very friendly and helpful especially connie the branch manager.
My only complaint is that it can take awhile to complete simple tasks.
They always seem to be a little short staffed.
The process to sign up was quick and easy.
Ana was very helpful and patient.
Shana was very nice and place is clean and kept up with.
She does a giod job for being alone in a 24hr laundry mat.
Thank you for your service here in the neighboring laundromat.
This bank is not the easiest bank to deal with.
My account has been open less than a month and there has been nothing but issues.
I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt and trying them out.
She was patient, listened to my problems and did everything that she could and it was a success.
She also helped me at 4:30 after i got off work when the bank closed at 5.
I had a terrible day and she turned it around 100%.
I went in to start up a new checking account last week and sat with josie r. she was amazing!
Awsome place with a great selection.
Emily knew her stuff and took good care of me.
Nothing better than talking sex with a cutie, highly recommend!
Stephanie is the best thing to happen to this branch and any bank.
She's helped me get all my financial things in order.
Even if she doesn't know the answer, she will do her research to assist me.
I have never had a bank experience like this before.
Chase has seriously won me over.
I'm usually not a fan of "big banks" but stephanie has made the transition smooth as butter.
There's a drive up atm and when i need services inside the staff is always friendly and smiling.
Will come here instead of the desert school across the street, they always give me a hard time.
I don't know what mike s. is talking about.
I have been banking with mountain america for 5 years now.
The mesa branch and it's employees are amazing!
They go above and beyond to serve especially connie the branch manager!
I use them for everything from car loans to home loans to general banking.
The federal reserve is a quasi-government institution, so their lack of weekend hours is expected but still disappointing.
I'd love a tour.
I'd love a free sample, too!
But neither are likely to happen.
Cleveland is my fifth in my quest to "collect" all of the federal reserve banks.
I've also been to atlanta, kansas city, boston and san francisco.
I like this location because it's located only 1.5 miles away from my house.
They also have security guard all the time just in case there are any issue.
I been here few times where i had to interact with tellers, loan offices and branch manager.
So far i have had pretty good experience as far as service goes.
Their new setup for locker is awesome, you don't have to wait for someone to access your locker.
You just scan your fingerprint and you are good to go.
One of the employee, alexia, was very kind!
She was great at keeping up conversation and really pepped-up my day.
We opened our son an account.
The gentleman assisting us was very informative.
Some of the employees are (ehh) if you get what i mean.
She was so helpful!
Don't get me started on alexis, she's the best!
I drive from where ever i am just for her.
She has the best personality i feel like i'm talking to a friend.
She's the best one there.
Not only is this building breathtaking, it is also an amazing place to learn about the history of money.
Fun place for kids and adults alike.
I wouldnt come in at 2am with a rolex cause you may get jacked.
But the la dry fluff and fold is $1.75 per lb
I've been with wells fargo for as long as i can remember and some locations are better than others.
This one thou is may favorite by far.
The staff is friendly, knows what they are doing, quick and always have a smile.
This place has really nice "teller stands" they also always seem to have little treats for members.
I love how quick and nice everyone is here.
I just wish they had a branch in north phoenix.
First time seeing and using teller assist at bofa.
I needed this, as i was disoriented by the decided un-bank-like appearance inside.
An unexpected, but not unpleasant experience.
Every experience i have had with first international band and trust has been near amazing.
My family loves how it feels more like a small town bank.
Came in pretty late with my bf for our anniversary and let me just say wow!
We were picked up in a limo, driver was awesome!
When we got there it was pretty empty, maybe 2 groups.
We got our drinks and sat near the floor.
The staff was amazing, girls were beautiful.
It was my first time at a strip club and i had a great experience.
I had a private dance with my bf and it was everything and more!
The girls made me feel super comfortable and my bf and i loved our experience.
I had an issue with an old account and a new deposit coming to that old account.
The next day i went in and spoke with travis.
Travis then went out his way to call me when my account was approved to be opened.
All this happened in two days for my long overdue return to hit my account.
I needed help bringing in my laundry and she helped me out and it was a lot.
She also let me know where the coin machine was, very easy going and nice.
Friendly and fast service.
Place is decorated for halloween adding a nice touch to look at while doing the boring chore of laundry
What a guy he let me call him calvin for most the conversation.
Talon listened and let me blow off steam as well.
Wow i have been banking since this was washington mutual years back and he was right.
Although i had an oversight on my part.
He did not make me feel like a idiot that had road rage.
I even connected with this young man with his easy going personality.
I hope i get you again on the line if i screw up again.
You will go far my friend.
You helped me and stood out in a crowd great job,.
Thanks chase for hiring people like "calvin" aka talon.
They treat me like family!!
Better than the big boys treated me!
Mid holiday we ran out of clean clothes and found this place.
The facility is clean and has all the amenities and the service is excellent.
I've had my boa/amex credit card for decades and have always gotten great service.
My most recent call was because my bill hadn't arrived in the mail, hence i missed payment.
Unfortunately, for this particular card's website, there's no way to contact them online unlike every other credit card.
No chat, no email, no contact form.
In this day of modern technology, it would be good to have this option.
As you know, people don't like calling into credit card co. we're put on hold forever etc.
I spoke w/ elyse/alise from the nevada office.
Very nice gal and i could tell immediately she had great customer service.
And she noted it and said they were working on it.
Then she went above and beyond.
What 5 star service!
Makes such a big difference (99.9% of the time).
I've actually been told by customer service reps at utility, airline, medical, credit card companies, etc.
Being nice & respectful goes a long way.
Doesn't work with everyone, but for the most part i've been lucky to deal w/ nice reps.
Hope this tip helps you on your next call you have to make :)
They have good rates on loans, etc..
I also like the identity protection feature that they've contracted with a company to offer to memebers.
Thanks to all azfcu locations and to the credit union in it's entirety.
Liz & kevin worked hard to earn the business and provide exceptional customer service.
After having terrible experiences at 2 other bofa branches trying to get a signature guarantee, i went to this branch.
Liz and kevin were professional and did everything they could to meet my needs.
Fyi; the worst branch i visited was at via ventura and hayden.
The branch is easy to find right on maryland parkway.
The people are extremely friendly and helpful.
Letty, who works with small businesses, is very knowledgeable and personable.
She is extremely helpful.
Lines aren't long and it's never busy.
Best customer service i've never had.
I was so desperated.
However, a banker "nick" helped me patiently and i could leave this branch with a smile.
I joined the credit union about a month ago and i am so happy!
All of the people are incredible.
We financed our new vehicle and had outstanding customer service with richie smith.
So glad my husband and i decided to leave the traditional banks and go the credit union path.
It's very personalized experience and they remember your name.
Carmen was the wonderful lady who worked with us, and what a great and painless experience it was!
We are fans for life, thank you carmen!
I came in just looking for information to refinance my auto loan .
Jackie martin was so helpful that i even filled out an application to apply for a new loan.
I was so pleased with her patience and was pleased that she was able to answer all my questions.
She even called me an hour after i left to let me know i was approved!
I look forward to coming back to open a new account with jackie.
Thank you so much!
Kirsten h was so attentive and answered all of our questions.
She made it such a wonderful experience.
We were opening a number of accounts and made me glad we are doing business with chase.
They report to shareholders who expect to see profit, and that profit comes from you.
Credit unions answer to their depositors (i.e.
They are not about profit, there are no investors.
There's just the members.
This particular credit union is very good.
I've been very happy with them for over 18 years.
Great service and friendly staff!
I enjoy visiting this location for all of my banking needs.
Bank of america offers great options for everyone from savings accounts to home loans.
We're so grateful to clark county credit union (especially terri kight!)
For helping us with our new home loan.
I'd highly recommend using cccu for your next home loan, refi, and financial needs.
We're in our dream home now thanks to terri and cccu!
They can't tell them to use a machine after that customer waited for 15 minutes too.
They lend u money.
Maybe instead of going on yelp and criticizing and whining.
Do the proper thing that will actually make change and that is:  1.
Talk to a manager 2.
Email a manager 3.
Email or call head office  yelp only makes you feel better.
So 4/5 goes to them  the management needs to be.
Professionals through and through.
Security on-site and a comfy lobby that offers music, safety, and reading material while waiting for assistance.
So glad this is my credit union.
Five out of five!
I wouldn't really want to bank anywhere else.
We participated in the auto buyer program and it was a wonderful experience!
We did  not miss spending hours at a dealership to haggle and wheel n' deal-that is for sure.
We would highly recommend the program if you are looking to buy a car!
I recently opened an account with pnc, and the process was easy.
They walked me through step-by-step in selecting which accounts would benefit me the most.
They walked me through the online features, and catered everything to my wants and needs.
Honestly, i don't know how i did without the convenience of pnc before.
Today i had some business at this branch.
The nice and very helpful young man who helped me was brian monzon.
Thank you so much.
I only come here to pay my bills and credit cards so it is not usually a happy occasion...
However the staff being mostly asian i.e chinese are fast, friendly and typically efficient.
If only i was a share holder in this back....sigh..
I have been with nevada state bank for over 12 years now.
I have both my business and personal accounts here, as well as my car loan.
They offer convenient hours 6 days a week, and many drive-thru's have extended hours.
I like the set up at  this annie oakley/sunset branch.
It's always clean inside and out.
I'm always treated professionally.
At one point i was a s"secret shopper" for the administration, and sent in branch reviews quarterly.
It made me feel like my opinion was valuable.
One complaint in 12 years.
Hmmm...they must be doing something right.
The ladies inside are always very friendly and accommodating .
But the atm machine is always down when you actually need it !
Soo annoying , either you can't deposit or you can't withdraw money out .
Great bank, believe it was the newest bank in fountain hills.
Love doing business with them!
Michael did a great job at getting us a home loan quickly.
He even drove two hours to bullhead city, az in order to be with us at closing!
Both he and alaxi were great folks to work with.
Both were attentive and available for any questions.
Beautiful historical chase bank location.
I had dreams about this bank as a kid.
Best part they treat you like a big baller on a teacher budget oh yeah
This is a locally-based community bank in south charlotte that really focuses on customer service.
My friend has a business account here and i have been on several occasions to make deposits for him.
I am seriously considering switching all of my accounts over from the big bank i currently use.
All of the employees that i have encountered are friendly and helpful.
And they always offer customers fresh coffee or bottled water and some sort of fresh  pastry or cookie.
Plus, if you are a small business owner, they have conference rooms available for customers to reserve for meetings.
All in all, if you are looking for a smaller bank with more personal service, you should check them out.
I finally heard from a staff person first thing in the morning as promised the second time.
She was very apologetic about not getting in touch with me before.
I explained my concern and position on a problem i had with my account.
She listened, asked me some questions and immediately corrected it.
I will be staying with afcu.
I had a wonderful experience at this bank.
Needed a bank draft but my home branch is up north.
They gladly helped me obtain a bank draft, and were pleasant and funny.
Brightened my day as a customer!
I love it when a banker respects my time and my business.
I waited at the door until they opened, promptly and needed to open another account.
Very friendly and customer service is key!
The team has a lot to offer their customer in loan and personal finance help.
I have been in the mortgage industry for decades and i host a daily radio program.
I am always confident and pleased when i introduce clients and listeners to the folks at fortress credit pro.
It took chase less than 30 days to accomplish what us bank couldn't do in 4 months.
Unlike us bank, chase's loan process is efficient and not run by a bunch of idiots.
I started my application online, was contacted promptly, and assigned to a physical branch.
I like this branch.
They're all so nice and the wait is never that long.
Also, every time i have banking needs and questions, they're always available to help and answer
I refinanced my car with cynthia.
Great job, applied, approved, a little chit chat, funded and done.
All within a couple of hours.
A low rate and a huge savings too, thank you.
We cannot day enough about maximum title loans.
They are always helpful and easy to deal with.
Leanna is absolutely amazing, she is fast, efficient and easy to talk too.
No one is judgmental, rude or pushy.
Thank you leanna for all your help over the past few months.
For a person with no income, i sure spend a lot of time at the bank.
Something even funnier than that is, this isn't my primary bank.
So right about now, you might be asking the question, "ameerah, why exactly do you go to bofa?"
Being able to do so, without an account here, makes me happy.
And smiling helpful faces make me even happier, while i place their money in my purse.
I hate to battle the bell rd.
Why exactly i have an iphone that i don't use to its full abilities, i have no clue...
Newer chase branch in the center of town.
Pleasant staff but they only have one physical teller terminal.
Other branches youll see 3 tellers and 2 or 3 atm terminals inside.
Needless to say if someone has a complicated transaction the line and wait may be long.
Thankfully, i didnt have that issue.
Best banking staff i have ever come in contact with.
Very knowledgeable, professional and competent.
Not to mention attractive!
Love coming to this place.
The credit repair professionals at fortress have been nothing short of amazing.
They delivered just as they promised and removed over 40 negative items from my credit reports.
In addition they also educate you on what goes into a fico score.
Understanding that makes rebuilding your credit easy and fun.
I would recommend fortress credit pro to anyone who wants to see results.
I've been with dsfcu for 30 years.
I have had car loans, home mortgage loans,  equity loans, and personal loans, as well as savings products with them.
I now live out of state and have not found another credit union that can match them.
I am still with desert schools through branch banking and never plan to change.
Definitely worth the drive past the red rock location, no question.
Joe is the best!
Highly recommended to go through for your vehicle or motorcycle purchase!
Fast easy at great interest rates and joe is such a great help!
Since i live right down the street, i come to this branch as often as i can be.
This location used to be a 2-story restaurant / night club when the neighborhood was in development.
I used to have to drive all the way to tatum blvd.
Overall services was great.
Definitely recommend you to visit this branch if you are in this area.
My experience with one nevada was awesome!
I would definitely recommend banking with one nevada!
Their focus really is you!
The personnel was friendly and extremely helpful.
Provided great insight and mentioning all the different things that unify has to offer.
They truly take the time to go over every single one of your questions and concerns.
Ryan the branch manager was amazing!
He was helpful and professional.
He went out of his way to make sure i got the information i needed.
Therefore, you have to read the fine print, ask questions when concerned and if necessary make a stink.
Branch manager kathy was very helpful and friendly.
She was patient and helped me with the refinancing of my car.
Jackie was also an amazing assist.
She finalized everything and was very informative and professional with my questions.
Without exception david driscoll and danielle wagner are the best in the business.
David and danielle know the mortgage business.
They are wonderful communicators and constantly stay in contact.
So if you are a prospective buyer in need of loan please do not hesitate to call david or danielle.
Recently visited this branch for some sensitive financial matters .
I was met by the branch manager, callin mote.
He was extremely pleasant and knowledgeable.
He made this difficult transaction a smooth process.
I will definitely be back soon to do more business with this branch because of the great impression callin made.
One of the few locations that is.
Friendly service and a speedy drive-thru!
Never any issues for me .
Just joined family trust in fort mill , the staff was excellent & very pleasant.
The branch manager nikki is fantastic!!!!!
Already having pnc accounts separately made it super easy to just have a joint account added for us.
I love marisol fcu.
I have been a member for 7+years.
I enjoy the personalized service you receive.
Just by banking there i get additional discounts at other business.
I like that they are invested in the community, provide scholarships to the youth, and education on finances.
Educated me on my finances and help me set up a savings plan to get back on track.
Love them, been a member since 1997 when they were motorola employees credit union west.
I recently bought a new home.
I worked with kelley birt on my mortgage, and she was great.
Highly recommend the very personal and professional experience they offer.
Consistently helpful and fun.
This is a killer bank in general, but this branch takes service to a whole new level.
The company should model its service ideals around this location and britney especially.
I give teller, tina, the stars at rainbow branch.
Very congenial and informative.
I inquired about atm use out of town and she informed me of star point!
Excellent for one nevada clients.
Employees are personable and dedicated to help very patient & helpful.
The environment was clean and wasn't crowded.
They staff acknowledges you as soon as you walk through the doors.
Financial advisors are available to communicate with you when you need advice.
Overall great union to bank with!
Hi  used to work with jonathan  enwia to refi my home.
I would say jonathan was good refi officer, responsive and helpful.
I had hard time to collect all my fin docs, but all lenders require it nowdays.
Be prepared and your refi will be on time and painless.
The process was quick and painless.
The guy who talked to me first was abrupt but not rude.
He called for a woman named trinity who was very nice and showed sympathy to my almost week long cold.
She didn't try to up sell anything and was very pleasant.
I went to the atm and got a statement to prove it was actually in there!)
My favorite wells location.
Staff is efficient, friendly and fun.
I like that most locations are open on saturdays and that there are so many locations!
See paul t. for your personal banking needs.
Michael is the consummate professional!
He kept us on point and even got our final.approvals completed earlier than expected!
He was a pleasure to work with
I am welcomed multiple times when i walk in and always with a smiling face.
Everyone is eager to help you...
Even if it is not their job they help direct you in the right way.
For some reason this location seems to never be busy for me and i go during busy hours.
I always have a great time speaking with the bank tellers.
They are personable and great.
The location is also perfect!
Plus there is this really cute guy who works there.
Would recommend if your trying to repair/build credit, start with a checking account from one nevada credit union!
Thank you very much for helping us switch from safeco and saving us $884 a year.
Jackie kohl is a star!
Of note recently, i used their mortgage specialist, jon dedeaux & relationship banker, jillian james.
Both gave excellent, professional, knowledgeable service, were available for appointments and efficient at their specialties.
They returned calls in a timely manner, answered all questions thoroughly, and were very communicative.
Thank you to both for the time spent assisting me with my various banking needs.
This is my favorite branch of chase in our area.
Located inside the safeway supermarket, this is a very convenient location.
The employees here are friendly and go over and above with their customer service.
I cashed a large check here and they made an exception to give me the cash.
They're also open on saturdays....score!
Return factor - 100%
A few years ago on christmas eve, we went to our condo and walked into ankle-deep water.
The entire lower floor was flooded.
I called the state farm claims number and they had a crew out within the hour (it was almost midnight).
I cannot tell you how much i appreciate her personal service - especially in the very middle of christmas.
Little did i know that this was my lucky day!
Joanna helped me open a new checking account and explained the many services available from the credit union.
As the list of benefits grew, i began to wonder why i had spent years arguing with chase.
Blanca ramirez was so great!!
She helped open up a bank account, and gave excellent service!
Looking forward to banking with one nevada
Keep in mind everyone's credit situation is different, but with all the credit co.'s mix-ups (my acct.
This isn't my normal branch.
When i walked in there was a line but it moved pretty quick and the teller was extremely friendly.
I accidentally put an extra $100 in my deposit.
The teller caught it and added it.
This weld fargo location is my second favorite one that i have been too in the city.
This place is not like that at all.
When a bank can thank you by your first name that makes me want to come back and bank here.
I've been handling a relatives estate and noticed that she had an account with this credit union.
So, i went to the above named branch to see about it.
I met with banker tyler gardner.
Tyler was friendly, helpful and professional.
Michael is very professional, i highly recommended him.
From start to finish it was a very pleasant experience.
I will continue to refer him to all my colleagues and friends.
Everyone here is nice.
I grew up coming to this bank with my mom and opened a checking/savings account after my 18th birthday!!
At the time it was nevada federal credit union.
I think the number is 16.
Over the years i've had a few overdrafts and the word is they will reimburse 2 a year.
I like being able to deposit in the atm.
Never have there been any lost cash or discrepancies!
One of the newer machines that count the money jammed with 18 one hundred dollar bills!
It was 7am on a saturday and there is no representatives available outside of business hours!!
Thankfully they immediately credited the entire amount!
I've done 2 credit builder loans that were very helpful in repairing my credit!
They were very simple to start!
I will continue banking here probably forever!
They did an amazing job at repairing my credit.
My credit is now excellent.
I refer everyone i know that needs credit repair to them.
Thanks you david, melissa, galen, and rondi, and everyone else i have spoken with and worked with there.
Thanks unify and ryan.
You are the best.
This is kathy, not debbie.
Debbie is my sister.
Liola little is a lovely angel.
She signed me up for my bank account and was really just amazing.
I left feeling better than ever.
This agents office is outstanding.
And especailly jill, i just love her customer service and the way she treats me everytime i see her.
Very convenient location inside the fry's food store.
There's a closer one to my house, but i was already in this shopping area.
I needed to add an account and jamie was very helpful.
I was able to resolve what i came there to do and then did some shopping afterwards.
Gina was also super friendly.
Banking and shopping in one stop!
I had just had a terrible experience at the ahwahtukee location but this place really turned it around.
Max was a pleasure who went out of his way to help me out with my banking needs.
Give max a raise!
He really knows what customer service is all about
This review is just about their service.
They are 3 and 2 and tend to run a muck.
I keep them in line but they can be a headache sometimes.
Marci is also really awesome as well.
Keep up the good work...this is my favorite citibank branch.
Brian b is fantastic  he helped me open my new account  and also is in the process of helping.
Me with a auto loan  he answered all my questions  and explained everything to me  thanks
Nice clean friendly place guy helped and greeted me right away and answered all my questions.
He was very friendly and helpful will be doing banking with this bank.
I had fraudulent activity on my account.
One nevada took care of all the charges with no problem.
Thanks to kathy at one nevada.
I love this bank and all of the tellers.
I have been with cccu for at least 20 years!
I opened an account with them when i was in high school or my first year at unlv.
I was able to get my first credit card and first car loan through them.
The service is top notch!
I am a member of the best credit union in las vegas and would never transfer.
Always friendly and if i have a question, i can call and speak to a person.
I've banked at busey for twenty years and have had excellent service from tellers, loan agents and personal bankers.
I know great customer service because i worked in that industry for a long time, and this was great service.
Great place to bank!
Great rates on loans and easy process!
I've been banking here for 7 years since moving to the area.
Nicest people that i've ever dealt with.
I currently have a vehicle loan through them which i have had no issues with.
Very easy and secure payments.
But the service that latoya gave me was phenomenal!
She kept in touch every step of the way and kept me informed with everything that she knew about it.
Just from her great service is the reason why i rate this branch 5 stars.
This credit union is amazing.
I wish i could have joined them sooner.
Staff is extremely helpful and professional.
I highly recommend this credit union to anyone looking to get a loan or have a checking account.
Much better than any bank in town.
Citi bank is hands down one of the best banks in vegas.
Other major banks want to charge you fees left and right.
I have no hidden charges, receive free checks, everything is upfront.
Also, thank you robert arnold for being a great branch manager.
Keep doing what you're doing.
You're obviously doing something right.
This is the best bank i've ever been with.
All the employees take care of you as soon as you walk in.
I've never seen or heard of any other bank that will take care of their customers like this.
Recommended already to my family and friends!
Danielle wagner is a great lender to work with.
She is professional and knowledgeable.
The most that stands out about her is her communication.
She is always updating all parties and keeping us informed about the transaction which is extremely important.
I have been going to this branch for over 3 yrs.
The staff is always smiling and friendly.
Professional and on top of things.
Always ready to help and assist!
Thank you arizona central!!!
I recently refinanced my home with the help of david, he did an amazing job.
We love the personal touch rather than just being a number at a big bank.
Everyone has been so nice to us whether in person or over the phone.
So happy we chose to come here for our financial needs!
I believe there is still an exclusivity in belonging to a credit union.
Desert schools has always been good to us.
Any fees are minimal in comparison to other banks.
I have been banking with them for about ten years.
In that time, any issues i had were resolved promptly.
I bank with wells fargo, so any branch is fine with me.
This one happens to have converted to the check scanning deposits without an envelope and that's quite convenient!
I had to stop a second time because the armored truck person was emptying the atm machines.
Do they have to close everything outside when they're doing this?
You definitely lost a star when i had to come back to make the deposit.
Tina your million dollar smile the last 10 years  plus brings a lot of value to this great company.
Big shout out to "joe" & "dan" for coming through on my ride!!!!
Truly thankful and grateful for such a friendly, and caring experience!
Getting me the best in rates, apr, mileages, payments and looks :)  may god bless you 2 gentlemen abundently!
#clark county credit union #joe #dan
I love doing all my business banking at this chase branch.
Christian, one of the private client banker's, is more than accommodating and is a great guy to work with.
Ask for christian and you always be taken care of!
Love this newer version of azfcu.
Was informed our branch on bell was closing and we had to move the safe deposit box  by october 25th.
Figured this location was most convenient when traveling.
Michael was super friendly,  helpful and just overall good to work with.
Got our new box opened, questions answered and friendly service.
This is my sunday bank.
When i need to make a quick deposit or withdrawal, this is the branch to which i go.
It's easy to get to, there are several other businesses here that makes the whole area a one stop place.
I have found the tellers to be quite competent when i've had to go inside.
Actually, i normally go right next door to the starbucks in albertson's.
Like i said,ma one stop place!
In general, i have never been a fan of bank of america.
However, i have a prepaid debit card with them that i sometimes withdrawl cash.
I have been to this location twice.
Both times there was little or no time waiting in line.
The tellers were pleasant.
Service is good at this location.
Helpful, informative, and patient employees.
Took over half an hour to explain everything i had questions on.
I felt no pressure to open a new account with them which is much appreciated.
Came here to spread out some money...i had a buddy recommend them, and their rates were good at the time.
), but since that wasn't really what i needed here, it didn't bother me.
They always greet you with a smile and provide friendly customer service.
Best bank on the market right now!
The customer service is just fantastic.
Thank you for all that you do!!
Everyone there is always so helpful and very friendly, there really care about there customers!
I highly recommend going to this location..
This is really the only us bank branch that i use.
Very helpful, wonderful people!
I was trying to by a house and my credit was to low to qualify.
My wife and i were able to buy our home and at a very good interest rate.
Rondi and fortress credit pro know thier stuff and the laws that follow.
I am so happy with my insurance and the folks at marsden's office are a big part of it!
Patrick and his staff have always been friendly, personable, and so very easy to talk to.
They always seem to have time to answer my questions and i come up with a lot of them.
And their location is convenient - right on the capitol square.
David driscoll did an amazing job.
He took us step by step through everything and made sure we understood what the process was like.
He always assured us if we had any questions or concerns that we could contact him about it.
He even took the time and went with us to our final signing which was greatly appreciated.
We will definitely recommend him to all our friends and family who are looking to buy a new home.
Friendly, but didn't follow my deposit instruction which i didn't realize until the next night when i checked my account.
Convenient location right at the freeway.
The schwab website has limited info for investors making a trade.
It's best to get info from other websites and then go back to the schwab website to make your trade.
Their people at that location are friendly and are able to field questions.
The employees at this branch are very friendly and helpful.
Generally young and energetic.
The member focused, non profit, orientation of the credit union really shines through here.
No drive thru at this branch.
There is, however, an atm out front you can use if you don't mind getting out of your car.
They're non profit, but they still have to cover the cost of salaries, rent, computers...
Still, there's a chance they may offer better deposit and loan rates than the big banks.
Not a bad trade off.
Their website is super user friendly and their products are great.
Would definitely recommend if you're looking for a credit union!
I really like the idea of a credit union versus a bank.
Customer service is really helpful in person and i like that they have extended hours at some locations.
However, when you do talk to a live representative they are friendly and knowledgeable.
I don't feel rushed or treated like another number.
They really try to work with you and address your questions or concerns.
They offer competitive rates for car and home loans too.
I really would recommend america first credit union for your banking needs.
Marcus g at the s. rainbow location saved my life!
An hour before they close and a holiday on friday, he helped me with all my needs and my anxiety!!!
Thank you so much for working so hard to get me the cash i needed.
I was able to get in and out on a very timely manner.
As i walked into the teller area she greeted me from afar and welcomed me over to her booth.
Quick, easy, no line at 9:20am.
I couldn't ask for a better agent!!!
If your looking for a honest and reliable insurance agent, william is the agent for you!
Amazing credit union, the staff is amazing and very friendly and helpful.
I was with bofa for about 10 years and i am so happy that i switched over!
Cause afcu has been so helpful with all needs.
If you haven't made the switch i would do it.
Friendly staff and conveniently located at windmill and 215 as you get off the highway it's right there.
When you get frustrated with big banking try the clark county credit union.
They're much more responsive, quick and friendly at this branch.
I've been much happier there lately.
Michael and his team are very professional and helpful.
Michael helped me who is first time home buyer to closed escrow within 20 days .
Highly recommend who need to buy new house or refinance .
Very happy and thanks full for the service
I absolutely love this branch!
I have been a member for over 4 years.
Actually i do not belong to this bank, but my husband does.
We love this place
I'm not sure why the bad reviews as mike d said.
I've been banking here for over 3 years and have not had any problems.
There weren't many banks that fit this description.
I don't remember the exact details and might have them off.
We got the $200 when we met the criteria.
Not 1 penny has been ever assessed.
We earn a little interest on our accounts, but we don't keep huge balances over a few thousand.
I don't have any wait or a long wait.
I always get my questions answered and am helped in the way i need.
Didn't count any money to do this.
The kids did this for many weeks until all their change was gone.
Honestly, we love this bank.
They have great services for what we need.
I've never had any issues in the maybe 3-4 yrs we've been with them.
Friendly tellers, employee opening and closing the front door for clients.
Every wells fargo has amazing service!
I work at a competitor bank and know good banking service!
Joanna was awesome and help me with my new account.
She help me with my new checking account.
We started working with sharon for our 3 vehicles and homeowners and she made the transition hassle free.
Shortly after becoming sharon's client, my car was stolen and subsequently returned but it was damaged.
She was responsive, thorough and helped ease a tremendously stressful situation.
Her agency cares about their clients and gives you personalized, "home town" attention.
I've been a member of sharonview federal credit union for 27 years.
I've experienced nothing but greatness with the staff at any location that i've visited.
My current office here in fayetteville nc are the best!
I became disabled in 2012 and wendy, mrs. rivera went above and beyond to assist me with my needs.
Dome days i hurt so bad that they or the branch manager would come to the car and assist me.
My children are also members here as well.
I love sfcu since i was 18 years old.
Brandon an associate in greenville, sc is an awesome associate as well.
She is an asset to the organization.
This 853 bank location is my favorite bank due to your very friendly and professional staff like tina most especially!
She is very patient & professional,  no wonder she been there very loyal & definitely  an asset to your company.
She should commended for her good work.
Have been using alahambra now for 2 months to make my van payment.
I am always greeted with the friendliest people.
I will use them for a long time.
Thank you alahambra for having awesome staff!
They called and working hard to correct a problem that had gone on way to long.
I've gotten phone calls,  follow ups and kept me informed of every thing as it happens.
Thank you for your immediate attention to this problem.
This place is great, easy money.
Corina and april were fantastick!
They made me feel important with no hassles.
Id recommend maximum title to everybody.
Down to earth, easy to talk to and his team members are friendly and professional.
When i walked into the office i was greeted with friendly hellos.
It became very frustrating.
I decided to start looking for other insurance.
Price was important, but customer service was my number one concern.
This office brought great customer service and was able to save me money.
I also opened a bank account with state farm bank.
I had no idea state farm had one.
Perfect for all my personal and small business needs.
Great communication as well as i'm always greeted with a smile.
Very solution oriented branch that offers you everything to get your personal and business banking on track.
They called me about my financed truck and offered a pretty good deal on credit card options.
The lady was really nice but i haven't used them before and can't find one review?
I guess that might be a good thing?
I am writing this review on behalf of my mom, dolly.
She purchased a home in nv and is very happy with the service michael has provided.
He is very professional and kind.
He responds to emails very quickly.
He keeps you informed with your loan and closing went smoothly.
Incredibly knowledgeable staff, i have always had all of my questions answered and in a timely manner.
Very friendly and they really do care about your well being especially when you need it the most.
My claim was dealt with quickly and efficiently.
So my hard time actually took place at the spring mountain and arville branch at the drive-thru window.
The teller would not allow me to cash/deposit my check.
I asked, "so, if my legal name was nathaniel but the check said nathan, you wouldn't accept it?"
I asked for a manager and of course there was none.
Very well maintained branch with extremely nice and helpful employees!
I have been to this branch several times and i always receive the best customer service.
Everyone is always smiling and friendly.
By far the best bank i have visited!
:p thank you to rosa for being a great teller and making my deposit a seamless experience today!
Just bought a 2016 subaru from tod hale on friday, this is my second time buying from him.
Awesome experience from tod and also amanda young from arizona federal where i financed the vehicle.
I felt like i got an amazing price and amazing customer service.
As long as i live in arizona i will always do my car shopping with tod!
You'll never find anyone else who has your best interest in mind and is so easy to work with.
Thanks tod and amanda for the amazing experience and the amazing car!
Her staff is excellent taking my calls right away and getting me in whenever needed!
Thank you brenda wix and your staff for being great to my family and i!
Friendly, always professional and i enjoy coming to this branch because of it.
...4+ years and zero issues.
I like the personal attention you get in the close quarters of the store branch.
Working with josie updating our accounts.
She was wonderful and took her time to make sure everything is perfect!
We have been banking with one nevada since 1982, of course we are very happy with them!
I have stopped here a few times and i have always gotten prompt and friendly assistance.
Overall i have had a good experience at this branch.
This company sets the standard of integrity when it comes to taking care of its clients.
This is a five star business.
The ladies in the office were wonderful.
Not only was my experience over the top fast and easy but steve was so nice and incredibly professional.
I am so happy with the service i received and look forward to my future with citibank!
My fave branch...the staff are always helpful and friendly.
It can get busy on the weekends so i suggest you get there early to do your errand.
Jackie martin is very helpful and nice.
There was fraud used in my debit card.
She helped me get another debit card and was very nice about everything.
Thank you nevada one credit union!
I love banking with you guys!!!
And thank you jackie martin for being patient and helping me!!
- staff is really friendly and helpful.
Sometimes i get offered a bottle of water.
- while i was in line a chase member alerted/directed me to their new fancy in-shop super-atms.
- the super-atm accurately counted my multi-denominational deposit and gave me a receipt.
I'll using one of their super-atms more in the future.
- the teller jessica is really cool and professional.
Yeah, i know i'm reviewing a bank.
But wait, here's why...
These guys are great!
Incredibly friendly, remember you after 2 visits, and always offer you a bottle of water while you're there.
Seriously, it's the little things people!
I mostly frequent here to use the atm machine.
Few times i had gone inside, all the bankers are super nice.
Very quiet inside as most of their patrons use drive-thru tellers.
Also, they don't push any products on you as i have noticed few other branches do.
I like this location because it's near sprouts and safeway i frequent; get all my errands done all at once.
It's easy in and out.
Thanks to silver stare schools i was finally helped.
Latoya in the albertson's branch was friendly, helpful and professional.
Highly recommend this location!
When buying or refinancing, david driscoll is my go to person.
Made the process very easy.
I will never use anyone else again.
Yesenia  is very professional, she takes initiative and is very thorough.
She goes out of her way to take care of her customers.
Come get your taxes done here, great customer service might have to wait a little lets be real.
But at the end it will be worth it.
Professional at their best.
Brought my hubby here to get his acct and everyone had a smile even security.
Liola little was very thorough at explaining his options for accts and he is very pleased
Very friendly tellers, and there is never too long of a line without some reinforcements to push people along.
Great place to do your banking and care about their customers and seem very organized.
Everyone was friendly and they made the process simple .
Liola little is the most kind hearted person.
Extremely helpful and patient.
I'm so grateful for having her assist me.
Definitely ask for liola little when you visit the rainbow branch, you will not be disappointed .
What a great car buying experience.
From the time we walked into your office, everything went smooth, quick and easy.
You got us the exact car we wanted and a great price on our trade.
We will be purchasing our vehicles from you in the future.
We highly recommend dan for your next vehicle purchase.
The tellers here are so nice they make you feel at home and the banking is easier than ever
I come to this location for shared branching.
The service here has always been great and the staff is always friendly and knowledgeable.
I'm also happy they are open on saturdays!
Letty at the westcliff location is amazing!
She did all the leg work.
She kept us informed.
Making the process stress free.
One nevada credit union on rainbow is the best!
Best customer service, best location!
What is great about one nevada is their convenience with mobile banking, and customer service.
Also, assisting in preventing identity theft.
There have been a couple of times where i received a call almost immediately to verify a purchase!
I feel that onc is looking out for me.
Love this location right down the street from my apartment.
Yes i will come back and sleazy do.
This credit union have helped me build my credit, given me what i need and always been there for me.
I am very proud to be one is us
I always get such great customers service at this chase.
The staff is so friendly as well as professional.
I always feel so well taken of!
I only go to this location!
Thank you all for the great customer service!
This is the best bank branch in the city.
Yes, they're part of the pnc giant but the staff here are just a great bunch.
We bank here for our business and they really are nice and they know me by name.
Josh and andy are always helpful and unlike every other bank they turnover is low.
All in all the only pnc i will go into.
The team is fantastic at this branch.
Always friendly, always gets my needs met without hassle.
Last time i was in i even had the branch manager help me.
If you need a bank in the area this one for sure knows what customer service is!
Love going to this branch as the tellers are all young, friendly, knowledgeable and very efficient.
Plus you never need to wait too long at all.
They are also very flexible and great at solving any issues immediately.
The employees at this branch are very caring and genuine.
They seem to know their customers individually and always ask about our family's well being.
Plus, on top of that, they are also open 7 days a week.
There is also a sitting area for kids or seniors while you are doing your banking.
They also have free cookie day every friday.
Josie and liola are the best at this branch.
They're accurate, quick, friendly, and answered all of my questions.
I am a very happy credit union member.
This branch is a little out of the way for me, but i do like going to this place.
It's never too busy and usually there's 5 customers in total.
So hardly any wait time.
The staff is friendly and polite, never rude.
Very friendly and courteous staff!!
The agent brenda wix is excellent!
I would highly recommend this office!
I had an issue with an nsf charge (and i had sufficient funds) i received from epcor.
After contacting epcor, i was told it was chase's issue, and to deal with them.
Spent about a half hour helping us.
I have my business accounts here for years.
Gina, the manager, is terrific.
Dealing with bank of nevada is ten times better than dealing with bank of america!
Aargh....saturday hours have changed.
Still give 5 stars because every visit is always awesome.
Friendliest tellers and right next to starbucks!!
This was our first joint account after getting married about a year ago.
We both had visa debit checking cards within five minutes of coming inside the bank.
I'm going to be a desert schools customer for life.
I'm about two months late on this but i figured better late than never!
Do not go through jim marsh kia!
My bf and i had a wonderful car buying experience through this credit union.
He was okay but i'm not sure about the other drivers...
I hope they were!
In a weeks time we were carless !
It was a miserable month.
Sharon dittmann is very responsive and helpful.
I love that they respond to my emails and/or voicemails same day.
Been coming here for about 3 years now.
Jose, the owner is great.
I've recommended about 5 or 6 friends and they all have the same experience.
Can't think of another place for my taxes.
Friendly service every time and i love the drive-thru atm.
It takes pictures of your cash and check deposits and adds the funds to your account quickly.
I've been banking with them for 8 years and they are great!
Iwould  just  like  to commend liola little on her excellent customer sevice skills.
She is not only efficient but through in her  job.
She made my banking experience much easier and  pleasant.
Please pass on  my many thanks for all her  service.
One  nevada credit union has got  themselves a real professional!
The gal on the phone was the most amazing person i have ever talked to at desert schools.
She helped me out so much and was so kind throughout the entire phone call.
I wish i could find out who she was and send her a huge thank you.
David driscoll assisted me while buying my first home on my own after a bad divorce.
He was very patient with me when explaining paper work and how things worked.
There was no hidden amounts or add-ons or changes that were not explained to me first.
He was always available and always returned my calls, emails and text.
I think he even assisted me once while on his vacation.
I plan on using david and his company again for any future plans.
The tellers were really friendly and helped me out with a couple questions i had, regarding my account...
The parking lot leaves something to be desired...
There are two outside tellers lines and one atm in the drive thru...
There's also a walk up atm beside the front door...
Well i drove to a dmv office to get a  dup lic.
What a great group of people running a credit union!
If you are looking for a secure home-town bank feel, you will find it here with this credit union.
Plus, they give back to their community constantly - simply good humans,
Why all the poor reviews folks?
Every time i enter this bank i'm greeted with a smile and hello from the staff.
The tellers are always friendly and meet my expectations each time.
A few times when 2-3 people were waiting in line, someone acknowledges that and extra help assists.
Also, grab a donut on saturday morning after your transaction.
Keep up the great work first bank.
Since switching to td, i have yet to be disappointed.
Security national was referred to me by a good friend and we were very impressed with michael's professionalism and reliability.
He is always very detailed with his explanations and provides quick responses to your questions.
Extremely courteous and professional.
Very efficient and methodical.
Would highly recommend them.
I've been a customer here for the 10 years i've been in phoenix.
They helped me tremendously with the one claim i've had.
I was super hesitant to leave b of a after 8 years but i finally needed to do it.
My first stop at wells fargo made me wonder why i didn't do it earlier!
Karen was super helpful and made me glad to have switched to wells fargo.
I was a bit skeptical about joining forces with a smaller bank.
Since i was new to arizona, i only knew the top 2 or 3 big wigs out there.
They explained everything to me in detail.
I went home to sleep on it.
After doing research i found out they were 5th in the country for banking and 3rd for mortgages.
Hey i felt more confidence, so i decided to go back and tranfer my accounts.
Well i didn't realize how easy it was to transition.
I went into the local branch and the banker was so pleasant.
A+ for customer service.
When i buy a home i'm going to them for my lending needs as well.
Thanks for the peace of mind, since i have so many other things to worry about.
I truly wish i could give more stars for this place.
I had no idea what i was getting into going to a credit union.
What i did know was that i was looking to be in better financial standings with my life in general.
My friend suggested coming here.
It was killing me so i went in and the staff was soooooo warm and friendly.
Joe is a super cool guy.
He was patient and very thorough with his information and up to this point has changed my life.
I'm a hairstylist new to the industry steadily building my clientele so every penny i get counts toward something.
I was so happy i cried!!!
Literally cried in the office tears of happiness.
I'm over the moon beyond the stars happy with my experience.
If you are looking for a great place with a great staff to bank with, don't hesitate.
Like this location, it is close to my home and the folks here are always nice.
I am still a fan, they have always been fair as they can be for being a huge bank.
I prefer the service at my community bank but they are too far and not enough locations.
Side note; i hate wells fargo with a passion.
I love this credit union!!
I couldn't ask for a better financial institution..
If you guys ever close i'll cry cause i'll miss you.
Thanks for being there for me!!
I love this us bank and the genuinely nice and caring customer service.
I always leave feeling a little bit happier and they are very knowledgeable about any questions i have.
These are the vegas conveniences i really missed when i moved.
It's a small, but full service branch nside an albertsons.
Pretty long lines on a sunday, but my teller was quick, friendly and super helpful
Tina m. is the best employee in that establishment!
Everyone there is friendly and she definitely goes the extra mile.
Thank you for the smooth transaction!
We thought our dream home was no longer going to be, after dealing with the builders lender.
Then david and team saved the day.
We thank you david!!
Heard some good things about this credit union.
Wanted to get away from the bigger banks.
Went into branch and had the most amazing experience from start to finish with goretti.
Super knowledgeable, super friendly.
We opened up several accounts.
Was so impressed with her i brought my teenage daughter back to open up accounts for her.
Goretti helped us again while educating my daughter.
The staff here is incredibly friendly and helpful!
I was so thrilled to find my local credit union in arizona after just moving from alaska!
This tempe location is the best!
They pretty much know me, personally, at this point.
The associates & help are always top-notch.
They are kind, friendly and caring.
This branch & their employees were on top of it!
Alaska usa has everyone else beat when it comes to customer service and a financial convenience you can trust.
Thank you for being the best option who cares enough to expand to areas you know your customers need you!
Why switch when your bank makes sure they have a presence to serve you to the area you have moved!?
Alaska usa & this mill ave. tempe branch deserves a 10 star rating.
I have never had a better banking experience.
Have enjoyed my banking experience.
From personal, to auto loans, savings and checking accounts.
Staff are friendly and professional for the most part.
Great meeting rooms available.
I have to admit i do not bank with them.
I happen to have a meeting with some colleagues and we didn't want the noise of a bar or restaurant.
One of my colleagues is a member of the bank and suggested we meet there.
The meeting room was beautiful.
Had wi-fi, a phone and white board.
Everything we needed for our meeting.
There are several meeting rooms that are available with an appointment.
I've been a customer for over 10 years and the customer service they provide is superb.
My agent is jacqueline kohl and her wealth of knowledge is stellar.
I would recommend william kohl - state farm insurance agent and i have to all my friends and family.
I went to the bank to get a document notarized and everyone was friendly and helpful.
I thought they were very professional and would recommend visiting the branch for your banking needs.
Overall i'm not a wells fargo fan and i'm really not a fan of grocery store bank branches in general.
This branch, along with a couple others have changed my outlook towards wells fargo.
This branch is the closest one to my office and located in a basha's store.
My banking needs require that i visit a teller about once a week.
The atm thing just doesn't work for me.
I expected them to scrutinize every $20 of the money i gave them, but that wasn't the case.
How much easier can it get?
I really like the service they provide here.
Made an appointment with jillian and she was awesome.
I was in scottsdale for a week-long business trip.
The funny part was that i forgot cash at home.
So 500+ miles away from home into the desert, i pulled out my atm card at a non-us bank machine.
I thought it was a mistake.
So i entered my pin and tried withdrawing four more times.
Decline decline decline decline.
So then i pulled out my phone, logged into my account, and saw that i had a healthy balance.
I thought about withdrawing cash via credit cards, but didn't want the added charges to do it.
The u.s. bank customer service line told me they shut my card down due to fraudulent charges.
They asked me about specific charges -- and these bank folks were right.
10 charges on the card that weren't mine.
All employees here were so friendly and nice.
They quickly looked at my account, took my tainted atm card, and gave me a new temporary one.
I was in and out in 5 minutes with all the courtesy and efficiency you could want.
If i was younger and not happily married with kids, i would've asked my teller on a date.
It was that good!
I love this chase location so much i moved my ira from another brand of bank.
Really nice folks and service has always been over the top.
Usually there are more than enough tellers to help everyone quickly.
Highly recommend this branch!
I had no problem with this wells fargo!
They were helpful and friendly and i was out of their quickly.
Thank you to the 2 young ladies that help me this morning..:)
I've been using this branch for years and have always found everyone to be friendly and helpful.
I've ordered foreign currency for a couple of trips, and done general banking with them since moving to fountain hills.
Today, however, they were spectacular.
Mr. theuerl went out of his way to help me with a stressful situation.
I very much appreciate his kindness and understanding.
You've earned my loyalty.
Not only is this truwest a convenient location it has wonderful staff.
I opened a checking/savings account and everything was explained in detail.
Any questions i had were answered appropriately.
The lobby is clean and they have comfortable chairs with little swing tables to wait in.
I'm sure i will be a member for life.
Go one nevada credit union!
Josie ramirez and cindy burgos helped me with my new accounts today.
Thank you so much!
Been with clark county credit union over 12 years and wouldn't bank any where else.
Love all my tellers!
I never knew that customer service could be this great at a credit union!
Everyone is always friendly and professional and will go out of their way to help you.
Keep up the great work!
I love this credit union!!!!
Michael ivanov was very professional at he's job.
Very organize with his schedule!!
Truwest has always served me and my family well over 30 years.
The people that work there are pleasant.
They offered me water when my car wouldn't start and had to wait for tow truck in middle of june.
The interior and exterior of truwest are very clean.
I'm involved with a few student orgs., so i frequent this bank pretty often.
All in a days work.
:)  the employees who work here are insanely helpful and accommodating.
They're just friendly people all around.
Xd  yelp 100 challenge 2015: #259
He spent 2 hours on the phone with me, walking me through each page and explaining everything.
I was amazed at his knowledge and patience.
I opened two different intelligent accounts and feel i have a much greater understanding of investments than before i called.
I highly recommend them!
David's customer service was impeccable!!
I plan on transferring all my employer retirement of accounts to them.
Jackie martin is so pleasant, professional and helpful!!!
Great customer service skills!!!
If you get to come to this location.... you gotta ask for jackie for greatness!
I love this bank.
They go out of their way to make sure your account is secure.
When my son was at basic training, he was buying his plane ticket to come home for christmas.
They called me to make sure that it was him using the card.
And then processed it immediately.
The customer service was awesome and always has been.
This is a nice branch of silver state schools credit union.
The people that work here all seem really happy and pleasant to deal with.
The line here usually moves very quickly as well.
I am usually in and out in under 10 minutes.
It is even quicker if i just need to use the atm that is available as well.
The only downside is that this location is inside of an albertson's grocery store.
I have a toddler who often falls asleep in the car, which makes everything more difficult.
This is a great bank and a very nice location.
I came in early in the morning and an representative named sasha greeted me and took care of me.
I needed a direct deposit form and she guided me through the process in less than 5 minutes.
I frequently visit chase bank for my home mortgage payments and rental property deposits.
There are no shortages of locations near me, but i like this location the best.
If you live the area and use chase or are looking for a new bank...this is a good choice.
Love love love this bank
One couldn't ask for a better employee.
I've been a credit union owner for three years now.
Nothing special, all the necessary goods here.
Employees:   they're all pretty nice & know what they're doing.
Okay, sometimes you wanna go where everybody knows your name ;] 3 stars.
I don't really blame them.
I guess they never really saw the need for a huge lot.
However, this means one less star today :[  like i said, not sure how it's supposedly fancier than a bank..
I get in, out, and move on.
I've had great luck with wells fargo and this location has always been good to me.
I have used a credit union for years, but decided i wanted advanced online bill pay options.
This location is an old one, but very clean, and the staff are very friendly.
I can't believe i have yet to review this place!
All of the tellers i've encountered have been so friendly and helpful!
I really enjoy being a member here and plan on being here for a long, long time!
This is my go to bank i suppose because it is on my side of town.
It's a good thing i actually like this location and i'm not forced to travel far for banking.
The staff is very pleasant and they are actually very friendly they know us all (the clients) by first name!!
I hear them often greeting everyone that walks in by their first name.
How cool is that?!
I feel very loved and appreciated, when they do that!
At least i know my money is safe!
She was helpful and professional.
She went out of her way to make sure i got the information i needed asap.
If there was an award for excellent service.
She should definitely get it
I should say i've been with them for 9 years.
I recommend family trust to everyone, over all of their competitors especially the big bank fiasco.
Every trip to every branch finds me treated like, well, family.
This particular branch is my "home branch" and i always enjoy speaking with all of the employees.
Family trust has multiple financial options and market leading rates!
Andrew was very patient and took very good care of me when i was ready to refinance my new vehicle.
I trust them, and you should too!
Yesterday i set up my socialbees businesses account (finally!)
And the process was super smooth and easy.
Now i'm ready for your credit cards, people... show me the money!
The bankers are very informative know all of the information we wanted to know.
I will be back to do my further banking.
I just stopped by this chase branch.
I went there with some trepidation because all four of the previous reviews awarded it only one star.
I walked in the door only a couple of minutes before they were supposed to close.
Rachel took great care of me.
She is very smart and friendly.
A nice bonus of of this location is that most of the employees seem to be bilingual.
So my husband and i have had an account with onenevada for almost 2 years now.
I explained the entire situation to her and she put in a request to reverse the charge.
Not only did it get done in 2 days, but she did in fact call me to notify me!
I cannot thank her enough for what she did.
If you get the pleasure of working with her, you will not be disappointed.
I wish i could hug her so tight for taking as good of care of us as she did!
Thank you so much josie!
I've had my personal accounts with wells fargo for about seven years now.
I've been very happy with their locations, employees, and service.
Some of their locations have long waits but this one never does.
Great service and liola little was amazing and very friendly!!
Thank you for your help!
Great staff that knows who you are when you come into the branches.
Really great loan rates and super quick turnaround time on closing the loan.
Way better than any of the big banks in town.
My wife and i recently moved into the area, and are members at an associated credit union.
We needed a local brick and mortar location to help with transactions as we settled in.
I have visited this branch twice now.
I have found the entire staff to be friendly and efficient.
They have met all of our needs quickly and without problems.
I walk in and they know me (even though i don't go there frequently).
They are always friendly and happy to help.
They don't make you feel like a number.
They work hard to keep their customers happy.
Very different from some of the big banks i've been with in the past.
Love sharonview it's the best bank on this planet.
Went in today to open a checking account and the banker was very nice and helpful!
Very easy to open the account.
A quick in and out on a saturday which was nice.
Great branch , everyone is friendly and calls you by your name as you walk.
Ms wesch is the best.
Carlos, matt, shanti also.
David was the ultimate professional.
I even closed early due to getting the loan funded early.
I highly recommend david for your mortgage needs!
I've been a member of heartland credit union for about 34 years.
Service with a smile has always been the case, and i'm never just a customer.
If your money is in a bank, you're really missing out on the credit union membership experience.
A loss for the community, i guess, but economics get to us every day, don't they?
These are things most people learn by the 5th grade, probably should take your banking advice from others.
:)  "believe" me "you're" a valued customer at the arizona federal credit union.
Great people and services.
Branch manager assisted me in opening an account and proactively providing crucial information.
Services are great here and the interest rates are competitive.
I don't have an account here, however, i use their "shared branching" service.
I've also used their notary public.
The people are very friendly and the location is really convenient.
Phenomenal customer service and very small business-friendly.
Kind tellers, managers, and security guard.
Managers go out of their way to look for opportunities to help small business owners.
I recommend this branch to everyone.
It's time to give credit where credit is due !!
My experience with wells fargo bank dates back at least 25 years.
I chose the bank because it was close to my location at the time, and was a recognized banking establishment.
I opened a joint checking and savings account today with my family.
Frankie, the banker, was very thorough and informative.
He was friendly and took his time with us.
I'm happy i did ... frankie gave us excellent customer service!
They cover all my closing cost including the title fees.
Matt and john had been extremely helpful and accommodating to my situation.
They even had the notary come to me to sign the final documents in chicago.
Nice and fast at this location, in n out 9 out of 10 visits.. all bank tellers are very pleasant.
Thanks for the great experience..
From the moment we entered the building, we were welcomed in with great hospitality.
Why don't you see a lot of great reviews for fortress?
Because most of their customers won't tell you what i'm about to.
Writing a review about a restaurant is one thing.
Revealing personal details about one's bad credit isn't the sort of thing most want to disclose.
People would prefer to quietly get their credit fixed and move on without drawing any attention to themselves.
But here's what you need to know.
I first heard about fortress on a radio show coming home from work in 2011.
I didn't know credit could be fixed and wasn't sure if it was true.
I used to have great credit before the real estate market tanked in 2008.
I was that guy who owned several homes including rental property before the crash.
When things got tough credit cards, car payments and the multiple mortgages stopped getting paid.
You probably know how this story goes.
It might be similar to your story.
I cautiously hired fortress in october of 2012 hoping for the best but not expecting much.
What sold me was the paid on performance agreement.
They'll bill me only for the items they could fix.
If they couldn't delete it i wouldn't pay.
There were no monthly fees and no contract to get locked into.
My middle score was a dismal 584.
Within 35 days six of the eight collections and a few late payments from other accounts were gone.
I was sent a bill for the items they deleted and decided to pay it off in small installments.
The second month my $7,800 amex charge-off and an $8,200 midland funding collection was deleted.
The third month two of my four tax liens were deleted along with the last two collections.
I was pretty surprised 100% of my collections were removed and they never reappeared.
My score went from 584 to 702.
Fast forward to today my middle score is 804.
I've even included a picture.
So why the handful of bad reviews?
Here's the reason for the bad reviews and why i wrote this.
They eventually did and i've been here nearly four years.
I've personally enrolled over 1,500 people in this program.
I've seen amazing results and i've seen some pretty disturbing things too.
First, let me appeal to your reason and common sense.
10,000+ happy clients over eleven years vs. 5-6 complaints.
That's about one complaint for every 2,000 happy clients.
How many companies can say that?
Every one of them was sent to collections for the same reason their creditors sent them to collections.
They didn't pay us either.
I've watched thousands of clients get a spectacular result.
Usually, 50% to 70% of their bad credit was deleted with a 50 to 150 point score increase.
They're excited about the result but aren't interested in writing reviews for everyone to see.
It's a reality in the credit repair industry and a risk we take as a paid on performance company.
We do all the work up front in good faith our clients will honor their agreement with us.
In those rare cases when they don't, we reluctantly send them to collections after trying to work with them.
Every disparaging comment on this page was posted days after getting notification we sent them to a collection company.
The credit we fixed which they refused to pay for has now been damaged again.
I encourage you to consider this information.
The bitter part is the few people here that are complaining are people i personally enrolled.
I watched them get a great repair then vanish once we sent them an invoice.
This place was great!
Some people frown upon credit unions but the people here are so helpful!
And better yet at the accounts are free!
This is the branch where i got my mortgage for my first home 2 years ago.
And, i can pay the bills online now.
I love this bank.
I have several accounts with them including a small business checking account which is totally free.
All of my accounts are free, one of them requires a minimum balance.
I do wish there were a few more in town.
I moved here from out of state and i had been searching for a home for about a year.
My credit wasn't the best and i have some hiccups on my credit report.
I just recently moved in my home 2 days ago and she help make it happen!
She was there until the very end/ closing table.
Clark county credit union and teri kight change lives one loan at a time...
I have referred at least two people and i will keep referring people to this company.
This was my 1st time dealing with a local credit union.
So far, my experience is very positive.
Anjelica, my member services rep. was very friendly and personable and was quick to help me with my new account.
I wasn't even kept waiting very long and it was a busy friday!
I would definitely recommend them based on my experience there.
I can into this branch to do some banking and jackie helped me.
I would highly recommend this bank !
She is a assets to your organization.
They really know their stuff!
I love banking here!
Hcu is a nice bank and usually the people are too.
There are several locations.
Maybe person above should try a different location?
Helpful staff and tellers.
I'm a long time member, and they've always had a smile on their faces.
They have several branches and the web site has been redesigned to be more intuitive.
If you're a chase customer, i'm sure you've been in some sh*tty branches before.
Broken atm's, long lines, 'tude tellers, people who have no idea who to get the job done, etc.
Walking into this branch is like walking into pleasantville.
People are literally hanging out of their offices to say hello/goodbye to you.
The teller was super competent and even waved some little fees for yours truly.
My debit card had also stopped working and they took care of that in about 5 min.
Not every store has this capability, but this one does.
Love the place they have the best tellers and charlotte and loan agents.
I have been doing business with sharonview for 15 years now and the service is a+++++.
This branch is usually very good with good service, clear explanations, and solutions to problems.
Truwest in general is fantastic and would highly recommend to anyone
I chose this bank originally because they were having a great deal to open up a checking account.
I'm so glad i did because it is simple and the people are great.
The only issue i had that keeps them from 5 stars for me is their loan department.
Other than that i have had no issues with this bank or its associates!
He was extremely helpful and personable.
His demeanor and temperament were just what i needed that day.
Thank you so much for your kindness matt!
Been to this location about four times for shared branching, and it was a great experience every time.
Jarrod, has been my teller many times, and he's polite, friendly, and patient.
After dealing with such nice people; i decided to open an account with truwest credit union.
The representative that helped open the account was was wonderful also.
Anjelica was the best.
I love this place.
Another 5 star review for one nevada!
The other day i was assisted by bianca and she's awesome!
She was very customer friendly, concerned about what i needed and helped me in a matter of a few minutes.
Denise the security guard is a sweetheart too!
Thank you onenevada for going above and beyond in customer service.
We did two refis with matt younan and the experience couldn't have been better.
He's super professional, always available and kept us in the loop throughout.
If there's ever an occasion to do it again, we won't hesitate to give matt another call.
It feels weird to review a bank .
.. but when you've had good service, it deserves a review.
I've been banking at this location for a few years, as i work less than a mile down the road.
I've been inside numerous times for notary services and cashier checks and always feel welcomed.
Some banks will make you feel like an inconvenience for services like that.
I've never had trouble at the atm either!
Brittany was very helpful and concerned with my issue.
She immediately remedied it and made me whole!
She also told me to file a fraud claim if they tried to do it again.
Her exceptional customer service and knowledge is appreciated.
She is one of the many reasons i love onenevada!!!
I am very skeptical about this credit union but the saving grace was josie.
She was friendly and happy to help.
We talked about a few things that were a little too personal, but she was comfortable to talk with.
Plus it was easy for others to hear our conversation in here.
Perhaps i heard a tone which was biased due to my mood.
I like being local, i like the way they called me.
I am still skeptical, but i am committed to giving them a chance.
I will leave my previous review as a reference to this updated review.
There was a teller 2 cubicles down that was totally evil.
She literally was yelling at an older gentleman who was asking for help.
I told josie when she came to get me "please don't talk to me like that".
Not every location has telling to save money.
The app has a bug that rejects you but it actually didn't reject you:/ .
My address appeared as a weekly rental in their database.
Also in the app, you can not view your account number.
Seriously a lot of bugs.
I want to leave the big banks but not into the dumpster.
I hope these things are fixed.
The people here are the most friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable bank staff i have ever met.
It is literally the customer service you would expect from a 5-star hotel.
We drive about 15 minutes to this location, because they are the best around.
We have our bank account, home loan, and daughter's account there.
Way to go wells fargo!
I receive prompt courteous attention from bill and his staff with any questions or issues i may have.
He answers all my questions and is never pushy about any coverage.
I feel confident in having all my coverage with bill davis and state farm.
I visited truwest credit union today to open a new checking and savings account.
The customer service is great and i highly recommend them to anyone looking for bank or credit union.
Breya and cresson were awesome!
They took a complicated situation and made it so easy to meet our needs.
Thank you both for a great experience!
Best financial institution in nevada!
Gina was the latest employee to help me and she was professional, patient and solved the problem!
So many great folks work for this company and i wouldn't dream of banking with anyone else.
Been there done that and the others aren't even close.
Great location, as it's tucked away between charleston and desert foothills.
Great for the west summerlin crowd.
Staff is very friendly.
The branch off of canyon pointe is lit much better, as a comparison.
Danny bhavsar, client relations vp, has been particularly helpful and has earned my trust.
It's like a target date fund, it's called "intelligent portfolios".
It's the george foreman of investing "set it and forget it", just don't forget to keep putting your money in!
Their app is very robust and easy to use.
You can deposit checks, transfer money, and see your investments and checking account all at a glance.
This is a great pnc location if you're in southside.
The staff is very friendly, and i've never had to stand in a long line.
We've opened up new accounts here, done standard transactions, and had cashier's checks cut here.
All with minimum fuss.
There's also an atm outside if you're looking for a pnc atm during off hours.
I definitely prefer this location to the other ss location on 18th & carson.
Less people in the bank, and less people outside of the bank asking you for money when you leave.
This is the best location in arizona, hands down.
I will go miles out of my way just to see francis.
She is phenomenal and the only person i trust for my business and personal banking.
I love this bank.
It's so convenient being located in the unlv's student union.
Nothing like grabbing lunch and doing your banking at the same time.
The staff here are amazing!
Especially the manager joanne.
They all make you feel very welcomed.
I enjoy seeing workers that love their job and enjoy what what they do.
I am extremely happy with this bank.
They understand what i need and meet my expectations of service always.
One last note: one nevada uses all point atm machines free of fees.
These machines are everywhere!
Even out of state.
Patrick has a great operation.
They are kind, but also extremely efficient and knowledgeable.
I never felt pushed to buy more coverage than i needed.
The referral they gave me was to a group of similarly honest and concerned agents.
Having sold insurance and quit because of how exploitative it can be, i cannot recommend patrick's office highly enough.
This might seem like hyperbole, but they restored my faith in insurance.
The staff is amazing at this branch, alan c, &  grace are so helpful, always courtesy and efficient, !!!!!
Never a long wait,,!
They made sure i didn't leave without getting every possible discount that i was eligible for!
I'd definitely recommend them as someone who moved out of state and wanted to keep state farm.
Came here on president's day.
I appreciated being able to still access my money thru the atm.
The option to get your cash disbursed in five dollar bills is the icing on the cake.
I hate how banks would force you to withdraw from the atms in 20s.
This is the second auto loan i've done with cccu.
In both instances i have received the best service.
Prompt responses, friendly reps!
This recent loan has been the quickest experience ever!!!
I will never use anyone else.
In fact, i'm telling all my co-workers and friends about them.
Cccu, you have a client for life!
Opened up a new account at this branch.
Had to wait a few minutes, but the waiting area was spacious.
The people there were really friendly.
Nice service, good bank (although some of the fees i dislike).
I'm really happy that no matter where i go, there's a bofa nearby.
We woked with matt younan who was very organized and responsive.
He kept us in loop on everything.
Our loan closed on time and we are very happy with their service so far.
Puneet and vinay behl
Staff is always super friendly, super helpful, and super quick.
I've never had to wait long in line for a deposit or for a personal banker.
My only complaint is that the coffee is weak.
Lou and greg have been helped me a lot for the past two months.
Especially lou,i cant tell you how nice she is,and how much i thankful her .
Went in yesterday to set up an account and irene was fantastic.
You can tell she enjoys her job and that she really cares about her customers.
I really appreciated her awareness that i was slacking in
This is not my bank but i had to stop in to do some business.
First, i must say the building is stunning.
It seems to be made out of an old house or something, with tall ceilings and beautiful wood pillars.
Second, the girl who helped me was very kind and upbeat.
She was fast and efficient, getting me on my way in no time.
The manager stacy at truwest gave me excellent service and she is an excellent employee.
She helped me with all questions i had.
I have been a customer for a while.
Left with a few accounts for a brief time and realized the mistake i made.
Great service along with great interest rates and account options.
Actually i would have given a rating of 4.999 stars,only because of the limited branches, but rounded up.
Thanks for all you do!
Thanks guys for all your help with my refinance.
I was told by a friend to call these guys because they have good rates.
I was very happy with the rate and how quick it took to finish.
I would definitely recommend this company for anyone looking for a mortgage.
Only problem is be prepared to scan a lot of documents.
The customer service and staff at this bank are excellent!
And with redeeming old us savings bonds.
She is now closing her b of a accounts and transferring them to chase.
I am doing the same  - they truly still focus on customer service.
This is my go to bank because of the excellent service they provide.
Kay is a great teller.
All the guys are great.
The manager hans goes above and beyond.
He is always there to help.
I am glad that i found you.
Great staff here...very efficient and helpful, not to mention their people care about you and your banking needs.
I recommend anyone i know looking for a good bank to look into opening their account with compass.
I've been a loyal customer for the past 8-8 1/2 years and have been completely happy and satisfied.
I would think of banking anywhere else!
They are doing it wrong.
Fortress credit will charge you exactly $0 dollars until they get done what they said they will do.
Then they bill you for exactly the pre-agreed amount.
It's the only legal, ethical and compliant way to repair negative hits to your credit file.
Thank you bank of america
We opened multiple accounts and car loan.
Thank you so much for all you do for all of us.
I have been with sfcu for about 20 yrs now.
I do all my banking with them & find them to be very friendly and helpful.
Yay for finding alaska fcu in az.
This location is the closest to our house.
About 25min away from chandler and located inside frys supermarket.
Second time at this location and the girls are super sweet and chatty.
Needed to start accounts for my two girls and deposit a check and spent about 30min in there.
Great hours, i believe they open from 9-6 mon-sat and start at 11 on sun.
They are open everyday with most holidays being an exception.
Employees said the company took care of their employees and it shows in their attitudes.
Felt like they actually loved their jobs and genuinely cared about their customers.
Friendly people, good service.
It's like they actually don't mind being at work.
Unlike their 16th and camelback location.
I have dealt with this office for 3 years and its been great .
The office staff is friendly, knowledgeable and helpful.
I insure everything with brenda wix and have a fair deal, considering i had a large homeowners claim.
Love this bank.. can always rely on great service,  great people and attitudes..
They explain everything help with all your needs.. all my kids have an account with trust worthy bank
This is the best place to do your banking!
We've been a member for quite awhile, always professional, knowledgeable, friendly & efficient.
In fact when my husband retires & we move from nevada we are keeping our account there!
Yes, it's a sub-prime card.
However, what it has done is allowed us to get standard cards with other companies.
That said, it's a solid one to keep if you can handle the annual fees.
If not, it's a good one to re-establish yourself until you can get to a better level card.
Nothing wrong with my experience at silver state.
I've been banking with them since 2006 and i don't have anything to complain about.
The tellers are nice and the service is exceptionally quick.
Personable and friendly is exactly how i like my bank.
Ssscu is just that!
Thank you very much chase you have a loyal customer for life.
I love this bank.
This one though is great.
I always get welcomed and they have helped me and answered every question no problem.
The inside is clean and the tellers very friendly.
I like all options for shopping and eating around it too.
The parking isn't as tight at this location as it can be at others.
They have drive up banking and a atm.
There is only one reason why this is not five stars, lack of locations.
The wt harris location closed but their atm is still fully functional and that is all i need.
I've been with coastal for 2 years now and have never had a problem.
I went into the branch for a car loan and left with savings and checking account.
At the time the checking accounts gave 5.25% apy on your checking account balance, far better than any savings account.
Over the past two years that rate has dropped to 2.25%, which is still higher than most every savings account.
Not only do you get an apy, but recently they changed their overdraft fees.
Their customer service is great.
Again locations is the problem, there are no coastal federal cu's in charlotte or anywhere near.
You can do whatever you need to do at credit unions in their network such as truliant, premier, piedmont.
Too bad ya don't have more around coastal!
Strangely, they have a k-9 unit parked there many afternoons.
Donna is great... very proffesional love this branch... is close to my house and very clean inside.
Thanks donna you're awsome
In most cases, it was not even close.
The repayment options were also very favorable.
The manager was very helpful and did a great job explaining everything to me.
Thank you, phil upchurch  just an update to my review of 3 years ago.
I highly recommend money usa.
The rates are the best in town!
This u.s. bank is great.
I love the set up of this location.
The staff is always helpful & very friendly.
They treat you like you have a million bucks with them.
They have the best rates on loans & the best checking accounts.
They have free accounts for all military & students.
I recommend this bank.
I recently moved from ca to las vegas, nv.
I came across sed poche state farm and i am very happy i did.
I will definitely be recommending sed poche to my colleagues and friends!
I switched from associated bank to uwcu when i was 16 and will never look back.
I honestly can't imagine going to any other bank, even when i leave wisconsin!
Let's be honestly, with mobile check deposit now, i probably won't ever leave this establishment.
All in all, i love you guys!
My day was really bad until i met marco wibowo.
I didn't know what risk to expect from having a credit union and what benefits there was to having one.
After sitting for only 5min with marco my attitude totally changed due to the knowledge and guidance of marco.
I'm excited he's now my personal banker and financial guider.
I highly recommend him for anyone that wants growth and security in their finacil future he's amazing!
If i ever need my bank account, i frequent this branch!!
Overall, i see happy faces and helpful associates at all times.
For a bank this busy that's very much appreciated and acknowledged each and every time!
:)  i'm so happy to bank with them and have them cover my banking needs since i was 17!!
Rick, ryan, and david have always been super helpful and friendly.
They have routinely gone above and beyond for me.
I am a customer for life.
(massive movie nerd over here).
So i've only been to this branch once, but.... wow!
What i saw blew my mind.
That is not what i got here.
(and even then, i was asked if i wanted coffee or water or anything while i waited.)
From start to finish, this was banking the way i always wished it could be.
Bankers don't care about being speedy or courteous, but this branch is a little better.
A little tough to get in, but once you get into the parking lot, tons of spaces.
I needed to come up and open another account.
Our banker aaron was very courteous and knowledgeable re: the questions we had.
He got us in and out in expedient time.
The atmosphere very modern and inviting.
The complimentary coffee station is nice.
The staff was very friendly.
Not only was the service great but claudia was kind enough to even offer me a cold bottle of water.
In fact i had a very positive experience with all td branches so far.
Diamond is a great manager and does his true best to help out people as much as he can.
A previous time, vanessa, another employee helped us set up our savings accounts and credit cards.
All the staff are so friendly and accommodating.
Favorite bank of america   thanks for going out the way, we really really appreciate it!!!!
- izzy and jose
Needed change and the atm does not provide that service.
I have never waited in a long line, actually don't remember having to wait at all.
The tellers are always friendly and professional.
The service people (not sure of their title) are outstanding as well.
Always polite and knowledgeable and thorough!
I can't even remember the last time i visited my money at this branch.
I only opened this account because i got free banking since i had a mortgage with us bank.
The service here is great because the tellers know what they are doing.
It saddens me that i'll have to close my accounts soon since i'll be refinancing my loan.
You guys have been great, but nothing lasts forever.
It's a convenient  location to my home and the machine has always been functioning when i've used it.
I've not been into the branch.
I have been with state farm for almost 20 years.
He makes himself available at all hours to help.
He checks in with his clients to review their current policies.
The office staff is extremely friendly and helpful.
Upon entry to any oncu, you sign into a book and wait to be called.
Their associates sit at desks and call you when it is your turn to be serviced.
This location provides stellar customer service.
It makes me feel like they are conscience of their customers and will do their best to be efficient.
I actually prefer it because it forces me to be more conscience of my money.
It also makes me feel safer, knowing that no random person can walk in and just rob them.
All the money is in the atm.
I had a good experience today.
Made it easy got me out of my funk and helped me out and fixed my issue.
This never happens normally at banks.
Chase has been amazing since i signed up with morgan at the sun city location.
I normally go see her today i just happened to be closer to this location
If you need a great bank they're here to assist.
Who would ever think that breaking up with a bank, especially bank of america (whom everyone knows i hate!!!!
), would be so bittersweet?
Trying to close my accounts was like pulling teeth.
That letter was completely ignored.
I received a letter with a form that needed to be notarized and sent back east to close the account.
Or i could go to any bank of america location for assistance.
Instead i was greeted by the sweetest customer service associate, called brianna.
She was very helpful and efficient and did attempt to retain me as a customer.
So it was with that thought that i followed through.
I do have to say that  i have been impressed with other associates at this particular branch in the past.
I recall a teller who had to deal with a rotten bitch of customer who was utterly rude and condescending.
Without raising her voice or losing her cool, the teller gave that attitude right back to her.
This was one of those case and that teller handled it perfectly in my opinion.
So this branch really stands out as best as it possibly can for bank of america.
Her warmth and personality and caring nature make her better suited to a local bank.
David is a great guy and very helpful.
They don't have a drive thru at this location.
You can use the drive thru atms, i chose to go in.
It is rarely ever crowded inside!
German is the best.
Always with a smile, remembers my name,  i will miss going to this location as i have moved.
The staff is always so friendly and eager to do anything they can to help you accomplish your goal.
I highly recommend this bank and branch to anyone and everyone interested in opening an account with a trustworthy bank!
Omg what a difference it was.
That was the fastest i've ever been in this bank to pay my rent.
These customers i was auth today, are very familiar with banks and things we could do to make lives easier.
I'll be going here from now on to pay my rent.
Thank god i thought outside the box and out worked and i'm very happy!!!
I've had no problems with this card since i got it 4 months ago.
I had terrible credit and they were the only ones who would approve a $400 line of credit.
I pay my balances in full every month and they increased my credit line to $600 in 2 months.
Yay for me again!
They help you establish and/or help improve bad credit.
Will i keep them for good?
Once i get my credit score past the 750 mark i will decide on whether i will keep this card.
In the meantime, let the shopping continue!
I have been with rick west for years now and have had no problems.
I have homeowners and auto policies with them and have been pleased the entire time.
I won't get into that one here.
Amanda and sam were very kind, professional, and were sure to make my experience a personal one.
What did we learn from this?
1 - just in case you forgot, the expression ' you get what you pay for" is 100% accurate.
2 - also, don't have long, extended, personal conversations on a bus.
It is just rude to make all of the other passengers listen to your business.
I'm puzzled by the low rating for this bank.
I needed to pick a bank/credit union and was pleased with chase's options.
I've been really happy with the switch.
In fact, i kinda' love it.
They have a super easy to navigate app that sends me instant updates on all my purchases.
It's really easy to keep track of where my money is going.
They have tons of branches across the us and that's super convenient since i travel a lot.
I always receive great service and decided to use them for all my banking/financial needs.
I come to this branch pretty often to make deposits and get my banking business squared away.
It's right in my neighborhood  in an ultra convenient location in the local shopping center (hello.. babystacks) .
The tellers here are super friendly and efficient.
The drive thru has multiple lanes to choose from and they rarely have a line for their atms.
I'm always greeted with a smile and they're always helpful.
This adds up to 5 stars from me.
These guys are awesome.
Highly recommend the loan officer noah kovner.
Very friendly with tons of knowledge.
You won't want to get your loan from anywhere else once you've spoken with them.
We needed someone to actually inform us and not leave us in the legal jargon dark.
After comparing rates, closing costs, customer service, points, lenders... we realized how little we knew about mortgages.
Never in my life has any bank issues been so easy.
I will continue using this particular bank just because of their services!!
I can contact suzie and the same day she will respond to my email or phone call.
Suzie explains everything in detail and makes certain that we understand all the benefits that one nevada offers.
Suzie suggests things that we may not know about.
She makes certain that we get the best benefits they offer.
I would recommend suzie to anyone that wants a "great" bank representative.
Bb&t indian trail along with all the other union county branches offered free shredding of important business papers this morning.
Yes, it's true what they say, you can tell they want your business!
Way to go bb&t.
Let's be honest we all would prefer to be treated like royalty.
But holding people on a short leash will cause you to lead a very unhappy life.
How about we treat others the way we'd like to be treated?
Cut them a break when possible?
Give them some slack.
And she was nothing, but professional and reassuring.
She explained the charges that were avoided and she printed out a new card.
The whole time she made a personal connection and wished me well on my journey to becoming a nurse.
Miss esther, thank you for caring and keep on doing a great job :).
I appreciate you helping me.
What a wonderful, friendly staff!
The staff graciously helped me with the process and were so kind about it.
She even waived the fee because it was for charity.
I've been a chase customer for a long time and will continue to be!
I wanted to refi my auto loan and the staff at oncu took great care of me.
Erica, yesenia, and gina were so professional and nice.
I look forward to banking with one nevada credit union.
Great place and awesome staff!
I've been a wells fargo customer ever since.
And this place has been my go-to bank because it's close to my house.
One thing i like about this location, is that they have a very friendly staff.
Their front desk associates are so friendly and accommodating.
Every time i step my foot on this bank, i'm always greeted with a smile!
Parking is not that bad.
There are more parking spaces at the back space of the bank.
There's also a walgreens and a lot more stores nearby.
Mind you, when it gets busy, it gets a lil uncomfortable too.
Let's say i go here regularly and when it's busy, most of the customers are men.
One time, i was wearing a cardigan and a long distressed shorts.
It wasn't revealing at all!
I look at them, and i feel like they were all mentally undressing me!
Is it because of the holes on the knees of my shorts?
Lol how uncomfortable that could be!
Bright mortgage group is an amazing company to work for!
I have been here 2 years now and i couldn't see myself anywhere else.
It is a stress free, fun environment and i am constantly learning new things.
Everyone here is a team player and we treat each other like family.
One thing i admire about this group is we can take on a challenge.
I would recommend this team to anyone looking for employment or a mortgage loan.
I use this bank almost every other day.
The workers are beyond amazing.
They are always professional and efficient.
I couldn't ask for kinder bankers.
Thank you for the continuous outstanding customer service.
This is a great state farm agency!
Ryan takes such good care of my account!!
He's very knowledgeable always making sure i have all the coverages i need...
I highly recommend him
Justin and dustin are always friendly and helpful.
Finally bmo financial group comes to the united states.
The staff is absolutely wonderful here i must say and bmo is one of the top institutions in the world.
Ever since the bmo merger with m&i, things have gotten amazing.
Excellent, freindly service with a smile.
This is the place where you want to conduct all your banking buisness.
Small branch inside albertsons.
Never very busy when i go in.
My experience with the bright mortgage team was excellent, from start to finish.
I immediately reached out to ryan, who happened to be on vacation with his family.
Andrea was also a great team player, working with me directly to gather necessary documents to ensure a smooth closing.
The closing went very smooth and i am enjoying my new home.
Thanks again to the bright mortgage team for providing me with an excellent mortgage customer experience!
I would highly recommend working with the bright mortgage for all your mortgage needs.
I've visited this branch on two separate occasions to set up new accounts.
Both times i was helped by marcos, who was very professional and knowledgeable.
When i had questions, he conversed with me over email and followed up with a phone call.
This branch is modern, clean, and seems to be well-run.
I have been a cccu member since 1999.
My favorite part about the credit union is that the they do not ridiculous fees.
From what i know they have a couple basic ways you can have your account set up.
I have used the electronic account and it has served me well.
I can do almost anything at the atm.
I live mostly off my debit card and have our income direct deposit so it works great for us.
Then you would only pay a fee when you use your debit card or use electronic services like the atm.
It was all done in one day and was a very easy process.
The staff are friendly and helpful.
I do my investing there and they are very knowledgeable and i am happy with how my investments are doing.
They have my mortgage with them as well.
Parking can be an issue if you have to drive there.
Helped me out of a jam.
They were nice and understanding and got me out of a bad loan.
Thankful for olivias help.
Seriously, the nicest people ever.
My whole family banks here and that family tradition will keep on going.
I'm looking forward to finishing up my mortgage re-fi.
Angela has been an angel!
I come to this bank almost everyday to make the deposit for my work.
The staff here is extremely pleasant!
They are attentive and very kind.
Even though i'm not currently a wells fargo customer, i plan to be.
These people really know how to treat their customers.
I have some wonderful news which probably most people won't care about but that is beside the point.
I'm happy about it.
This bac branch is nearest to my home.
I will share two examples with you.
One made you just not want to go in there, period, due to the charm she did not exude.
Another was nice enough but didn't seem to be really capable of doing the job.
I hold my bank to a higher standard as it is handling my money for me.
As a result, i guess i have higher expectations when i walk in the door as opposed to other businesses.
She'd been making some changes and customers seemed happy about it.
She even recognized me even though we hadn't had that much actual personal contact.
She also was pleasant enough to always take a moment to say hello when she say me in the future.
The moral of the story is this.
It is a pretty safe to say if you aren't happy with your branch, try this one.
I'll be going back.
When it involves my finances, this is the kind of attitude i like to see.
I felt this same attitude today so guess i can start using this branch again regularly.
Minor plus to all of this.
With the cost of gas, closer is always better!
Yet another reason as to why banking with cccu is the best.
Thank you, dennae and cccu!
Big thank you arturo a. the business/ personal specialist for taking great care of me in making things right!
Very grateful for your kindness in representing the wellsfargo well in helping your customers as if they are family.
Appreciate the human touch!
Places like this typically aren't so friendly.
Thanks again claudia for your exceptional customer service!
I recently needed something notorized and i had very bad start to the day.
It was nice to walk in and not have a crowded branch and have someone immediately available to help me.
It was a great solution.
I had no idea wells fargo offered free notary services.
Friendliest chase people in the north!
I've had some banking issues in the past which frustrated me but it was never the tellers fault.
Things happen, atms go down or they're busy.
The combination of my chase app, atm deposit capability and their service is a reason i choose chase.
Quick and easy if you do not want to deal with bank tellers for deposits and withdrawals.
24hr atm machine is inside and 1 drive through.
Easy in and out.
Great service and i love to support my local community
Im with kimberly b...this is a card for people rebuilding credit.
Mine got tanked due to a divorce.
I have been rebuilding, and started with a $300 limit, and it is now at $1250.
I do not carry a balance, ever.
It you are a day late, you haven't learned your lesson either.
A day late is a  day late.
You can sign up to get reminders to pay a week in advance.
Also, it is not a hidden $75 fee.
It's clearly disclosed, along with the $8.95 monthly fee.
People who place blame where it doesn't belong aren't going to take responsibility for getting their credit back in order.
It's a card to rebuild credit...you are going to pay for the privlege of doing so.
Stop blaming the company for being a business and take your finances into your own hands.
Brandon at academy was extremely professional and knowledgeable.
From the starting pre-qualification phase all the way to closing, he was communicative, honest, and very helpful.
In fact, he was even able to push the process along to allow us to close early!
Would definitely use again and would recommend them to any family or friends.
Marco w. thank you for your professionalism and great attitude.
We love "one nevada" and will recommend our friends to you at the fort apache branch.
I have your business cards!
I've been a cccu member since april 2014, i now have a auto loan, checking, savings & unsecured credit card.
I have nothing but good things to say about this bank.
They have approved me for my auto refi where some banks have denied me!
Their site is very user friendly!
The staff i've delt with at several locations (water street, wigwam & n tenaya) are very friendly & informative!
I do have to agree with one of the previous reviews ...
They are in much need of an update on their atm's....
They are not just 10+ yrs old they are 20+ yrs old maybe even older!
However, i don't agree with one previous review where they charge fees if you don't get your $$!
I've never had that experience at any atm for that matter!!!
Or the other review that stated they were charged $50 teller fees!
They are actually very reasonable!
They have walgreens every where!!!
So far so good
I have only been inside a few times.
I regularly use the atm.
I do most of my banking that way.
Went to the bank this afternoon since needed questions answered about my account that could not answer.
Got a fraud alert on my account and it wanted to make sure that i am an american citizen.
So went to show them that i am .
The alert come to find out was for the country i was born from clarification.
Not sure why asking these questions now.
Well the staff as usual wad very helpful and attended to my needs.
Got all the citizen questions all cleared up.
Got change for laundry for the week and a new debit card too coming.
This review is long overdue!
We absolutely love the staff at this branch and their professionalism.
Other branches we have visited have also been outstanding with service.
We have referred many friends, family members and clients and they all love this bank, especially this branch!
There was a gentleman greeting customers, who asked us about our needs.
He signed us up to meet a banker who could assist us and open a new account.
He told us the wait would be about 45 min.
It had only been 15 minutes when our banker, mr. david van vorce took us to his office.
He was professional, very knowledgeable and humorous.
He also showed us boa's new mobile app services, and admittedly, i learned as well.
We walked out with certain level of accomplishment and little more knowledgeable for new technologies.
I worked with john werner several years ago for 3 years.
I learned first hand that john was trustworthy and professional.
When my wife and i decided to buy a house i immediately dialed up john.
He was able to safe me thousands, not hundreds, on my home loan.
Even though we were hundreds of miles apart the transaction went smooth and there were no hiccups.
That's a winning combination, save money and get the best professional assistance from a savvy pro!
Very easy experience, no hassle, great customer service,  and there agent charlene was very helpful!
We worked with john for about 9 months before we actually purchased our home.
John was helpful, kind, and informative.
He knew we weren't looking to buy immediately, and unlike most, he didn't let that affect his time with us.
He never rushed me off of the phone and followed up periodically to answer any questions and just check in.
I have used john twice now.
John was there calming us and encouraging both parties with knowledge as to why.
The lord blessed us and paved the way with good, people, john is one of those people.
Hubby and i say by "faith & grace" we are here and couldn't be happier!
The drive-up atm almost never has a line.
Location has regular "bank hours" for walk-in/in-person transactions.
I find it convenient to turn into this location while traveling northbound on scottsdale road.
I like the new scanning feature for depositing checks!
I frequent this location from time to time and have never had a negative experience.
The team here is very friendly and the location is well maintained, spacious, and clean.
Oh...and by the way, i've never experienced a lengthy wait here, which is a bonus!
Higher interest rates than traditional banks,  great source for mutual funds & investments; as well as mortgages; even commercial.
It's open the public.
He has helped me to keep my insurance rates at a reasonably low rate even given my current unlucky situation.
He provides very valuable and reliable information.
He has been very good at getting back to me about any questions i've had along the way.
Often, he proposes ideas to save me money and secure my future further (who doesn't want that!).
If there is ever an issue, rick is very quick to address it and solve it with me.
He is very attentive and thorough which are very essential qualities i look for in an agent.
Lori was super helpful.
Gave me some guidance for my financial future and taught me some good stuff on how to rebuild my credit.
Thanks for restoring some of my faith in bofa :)
Well, another year later and my credit limit is now up to $2200!
I still use this for one charge a month and pay it off.
That's the reality of it.
I've been with ssscu for about 3 years and i needed a loan.
Jane dela cruz assisted me with my loan and credit card process very smoothly and efficiently.
We did the loan transaction over the phone and signed off on email and i thought that was very easy.
She's very nice and does a great job at what she does.
She's very helpful in getting me my loan and credit card.
I would highly recommend jane dela cruz for any loan transaction or credit card approval.
John moran and cardinal finance were awesome in our family purchasing a home.
They had the best rates, a streamlined process, and john was quick to answer any questions during the process.
I have refinanced many times in the past, and can say that john and cardinal are the best.
We will definitely work with him again on any future purchases or refinancing.
It is easy to brag about steve jarosh at midfirst bank.
He is the vice president/east valley business banking manager.
Today was my first experience inside this branch.
I haven't had good experiences with the bank of america telephone helpline.
However, today i was so pleased with amazing customer service.
I explained my issue to brian the bank teller.
Once he understood my issue he asked for the assistance of eric.
It was easy to tell that the staff at this branch work well together and make a great team.
I am a very satisfied customer and i am thankful to have my finances at bank of america.
Thank you all for your assistance this afternoon!
You made my day!
Teresa popp was amazing in helping me with my auto loan 1.99%.
Plus a 0.25% promo, my loan will be 1.74%.
Very easy and painless auto loan ever!!!!
She was professional at all times and went the extra mile to help me.
Green valley branch is very friendly and accessible and right is the corner of sunset and marks.
I was in an accident when i hit an elk coming home from flagstaff.
Called his office, everything was taken care of from towing to rental, to painting the vehicle.
Have home, cars, and now just moved my mother's policies to him.
He has had the same staff for over 25 years, so everyone is on the same page.
Love that about this agency.
Plus he's a dog lover, added bonus for me.
Just first rate service always.
Occasionally busy but they handle customers quickly but efficiently.
I recommend everyone to silver state school federal credit union.
I opened an auto loan yesterday and leesa lopez assisted me in doing so.
She tried every way to help me get approved.
Angela, virginia and pat all at pat estfan state farm insurance i highly recommend.
They are so professional so kind and courteous and helpful on the phone.
They have helped me numerous times and they're prompt in their responses.
I've had the pleasure of speaking with virginia and angela many times and can't speak highly enough about them.
If you're looking for insurance call pat estfan state farm insurance and speak with virginia and angela
My husband and i decided to split a vacation condo with another couple.
We charged the full cost of the condo on our costco citibank credit card.
The other couple gave us their half in cash.
I decided to try the atm.
I was able to put my credit card in the atm without a pin - which i don't have.
I simply selected payment and inserted the cash into the atm.
The atm totalled up the cash and asked if i wanted to apply the payment to my credit card.
I printed the receipt and away i went.
I came in today needing help i was nerves and upset.
Art helped me being kind and curteous also so helpful and today was his birthday.
I am very thankful to him for his help..
He has a great personality   one nevada is great.
First time i opened a credit union account and i had a very positive experience.
My member representative was leesa lopez and she was awesome.
She has great listening and communication skills which created such a positive interaction.
I have had no problems with the card or cust svc.
First of all you must read the fine print!!!
And they do give increases if you pay on time.
I tested my bankers patience this past week.
I switched cars 5 times before finally deciding to make a purchase after 3 weeks.
He was very patient with me and honored  my orignal auto rate.
His underwriter leticia cano made it simple.
They work together as a team.
Im not surprised to see marco wibowo's name all over yelp.
I specifically asked for him when i read his yelps.
A true professional and class act individual.
While i was signing my loan he had many people waiting for him in the lobby.
Im a member for life!
You earned my business.
Love my subaru and low payment!
I have been a state farm customer with pat estfan's office for many years.
I have always had great service and been very happy with all of my insurance needs.
My husband and i recently had the pleasure of working with skyler spicer on a loan.
State farm offers financing for cars, boats, etc.
Skyler was knowledgeable, professional, efficient, and extremely patient during the entire process.
He was an absolute joy to work with and made the process run so smoothly.
The employees i've dealt with throughout the years have been knowledgeable and kind.
My only gripe is not a lot of locations but they have quite a bit of participating atms.
The reason i give this location 5 stars is duncan.
After some confusion with my auto refinance he spent hours working the numbers, making calls and explaining everything to me.
He still saved me some money and added gap insurance.
Now i have my bank accounts with them and a personal loan.
Thanks for your hard work duncan!
I'll recommend one nevada credit union to my friends and family.
Wonderful staff, excellent customer service.
Would have given 5 stars but the parking lot is a disaster.
Even if u go real slow you risk doing injury to your under carriage.
I have used title loan companies in the past and not with the greatest experience.
They gave me the amount i was looking for and a dynamite interest rate!
I got a 1.99% auto refinance offer in the mail so i thought i would check it out.
Teresa, got me all set up in just a couple of hours.
They were all very nice, fast and efficient.
I since financed my new used car at the same 1.99%.
This time esther assisted me, also an excellent professional.
The best the dealer would do was 4.65%.
I hope to move all my banking there as soon as possible.
Alright, so i am reposting this review with a total 180 from the original i wrote.
So yet again the people of arizona federal credit union have come through and really helped me.
Thinking about joining again, i googled tscu, which didn't come up in search results.
Then i found this: tscu becomes landings credit union nov. 1,  2013 http://www.cutimes.com/2013/09/16/tempe-schools-credit-union-becomes-landings-credit
My aunt was a customer here.
All the folks at busey from the folks on the main floor to the investment staff were absolutely wonderful.
They helped us through a very difficult time and kept us informed of the next steps to take.
After more than 50 years dealing with banks, this was a stellar experience.
Uwcu is the best credit union ever!!
I tried to find a credit union that even comes close to uwcu, and it was such a fail.
The customer service and financial planning services are phenomenal.
I love you guys!
I have been using tscu for about 8-years now (and i'm not a teacher).
Nice folks, fair deals, and a really nice office right on mill.
They don't have much in the way of online banking yet (bill pay).
I much prefer dealing with these guys over the big corporate banks.
If you live in tempe i would sugggest you stop by and see what they have to offer.
Ffl has been around for a hundred years or something right here in lakewood.
A nice community bank that has all the bells and whistles of the major banks without the sterile, major-bank feel.
When we were shopping around for mortgages last year, they were far and away offering us the best deal.
The safe deposit box lady is always pleasant and remembers us when we come in.
A great bank i'd recommend to anyone.
If you're looking for a new bank and you live on the west side, you really should check them out.
I've been meaning to write this review for awhile now.
Back in february i had some issues with a wire payment.
I had originally gone to this branch to do the wire because i was going to be in the area.
After the wire was done, it didn't go through, the recipient didn't receive it.
Upon my second visit, i was directed to the manager of customer service.
She said she had called the number on file several times and left messages.
Although, i felt embarrassed, i really appreciate what she had done for me.
She also updated my information.
I really appreciate the extra effort.
One of the best service i've had with personal banker, pranay naidu.
Friendly, courteous, professional and most helpful.
A great start to my day and business.
I had never been part of a credit union before.
Kyndra made it a quick and easy process to open a checking account.
My previous visits were to the drive up atm, today was my first time stepping inside.
I had to go inside because i received notification of possible fraudulent charges on my debit card.
I was freaking out when i got there, and walked in looking like a deer in headlights.
I was quickly greeted by edwin (member solutions representative) and he listened to my plight.
He said the pending charge should fall off, but i could contact him if there were any issues.
He took my no longer useful card and said he could not provide a replacement larry fitzgerald card.
I use this branch a lot for shared branching transactions.
They are the best!
Fast, friendly and all around great service.
I have never had a poor experience and i'm glad to have the availability of this financial institution.
Their online "my portfolio" is the best in the business.
All other banks request switching but none can compare to bofa online.. and they know it.
Lauren is always patient with me and been so helpful !!!
All other serivce are fast too !
From nj and i needed to find a bank that was local.
I researched many banks (and their programs) and couldn't decide between wells fargo and bank of america.
After reading reviews (and seeing which  services were best) i decided to go with boa and i'm glad i did.
I definitely recommend this location to set up any accounts.
The facility is clean and the people are extremely helpful and friendly.
You are greeted by someone as soon as you walk into the building.
My bank advisor was vondrelle.
Very pleasant and knowledgeable.
I have received fantastic treatment from this credit union.
Credit one bank will not give credit to anybody with average or above average credit.
Its bad credit people only.
Yes - you will get a written denial that your credit is too good if you are average credit.
Credit one bank only deals with risky people.
For that reason they charge a lot of fees.
Once you understand this it's easier to accept them for what they are.
In my case i am very happy with them.
Back when i could not get any kind of a store card they gave me a chance.
Because of credit one now i have better cards and for that i'm very thankful!
I closed the card immediately.
Thank you adrian esparza, he is a personal banker in this branch.
Today you serve us very well.
Friendly and goes the extra mile.. my favorite bank and my favorite location
Staff is always friendly and ready to help!
Always looking out for anything they may be able to help with!
This place is truly great!
I've had my auto, life and renters insurance here for 13 years now and i will never leave.
Anytime i've called the office everyone is so nice and helpful and prompt when answering my questions.
I value great service wherever i go and this office gives just that, genuine great service.
I purchased a car from carmax.
One nevada credit union green valley branch financed the loan.
I was amazed that the speed my loan processed.
When i arrived teresa popp processed the paperwork and explained the terms very clearly to me.
The service at this branch was outstanding.
Everyone was smiling and jovial.
I felt comfortable and confident with one nevada credit union.
Green valley branch is awsome!
I wanted to reestablish my credit score and this card was perfect.
I knew exactly what i was doing.
I am very satisfied with this bank.
Small branch in the heart of cotswold.
Stopped by to grab some cash from the atm.
The atm is outside the branch right before the door.
There is lots of parking and it very easy to access this branch.
Didn't interact with of the employees however i'm really enjoying having an account with sun trust.
This is one of my favorite banks in the las vegas area.
The people here are super friendly and they get the job done!
It all started when i had fraud on my account.
Apparently some thief stole my checks and decided to go on a shopping spree and use my checking account.
I highly recommend this establishment .
He was quick, efficient and friendly.
Thanks to eric, it was a painless transaction and we are on the way.
I've been a customer of uwcu for almost a year and have been very satisfied with the service.
The branches are conviently located and the staff is always super friendly.
The website is ok but it often seems to be quite slow to load.
Rough location to get out of, rainbow is usually a mess right there.
I encountered a problem were my funds with suntrust were placed on hold.
Another bank would not verify a check i had written on my account with the other bank.
It was frustrating and disappointing.
I meet with the manager at suntrust cotswold branch.
Not only did she get it corrected within a couple of hours, she personally called me to tell me so.
My real estate agent recommended erik when my initial lender was stressing me out.
Erik and his team made all that stress go away.
He explained the entire process  in detail and was there to explain again when i had questions.
He and his team  kept in contact with me from start to finish.
I highly recommend erik to anyone  looking for a stress-free mortgage process!
I was never a fan of chase bank when they bought out washington mutual.
I was a long time customer at washington mutual and loved the service i always got with them.
The thought of going to a large bank had me leary.
When i moved to las vegas and opened my business i went to set up a business account.
Got me all set up in no time and was very informative.
Just the type of service i love.
The tellers are all friendly and helpful.
I have had nothing but a good experience from this branch of chase.
I especially like how the parking is close to the building, although it can be a narrow squeeze.
Tellers have always been helpful and personable.
I came in to the bank for a quick withdrawal.
Inez was my teller and she was super awesome and so friendly!
She made my transaction quick and pleasant!
Not all wells fargo's are created equal!
This is by far the best wf branch i've banked with.
Honestly, i feel a little spoiled here - everyone is so nice and accommodating.
This week, i received excellent customer service from mr. hernandez.
My mom and i went in today for some help to change some account numbers due to a fraud situation.
Dennae helped get everything sorted out and really went way above and beyond all expectations!
Great service, at a great bank!
This branch is inside safeway.
Any day, or any time i have performed business here, i've always experienced prompt exceptional courteous service.
I have never had to wait for more than one minute.
If there was one teller, they would promptly add another, immediately.
All the personnel employed here are very kind, generous, respectful, have a pristine appearance, and are very knowledgeable.
This is the best bank by far, of any others in the valley!
It's a very tiny branch, too!
I recently moved from mi to az and purchased a home in anthem.
I had two accounts in mi, one citizen bank and the other chase.
So i immediately went online to transfer the funds from citizen bank to my chase account.
That left mandy to help everyone waiting.
I asked to talk to the manager (shawn); but he was already tied up with another customer.
All the while the wonderful manager shawn was involved.
Their personal and professional approach will make me a lifetime, loyal chase bank customer.
Thank you mandy and shawn and thank you chase bank!
I was able to close on time and have now lived in my new home for six weeks.
Jay at pawn 1st was very helpful and tried to give the best deal.
He had great customer service.
I had a wonderful experience in cccu!
Dennae opened up a savings and checking account for me; she made the process incredibly easy and pleasant!
A few days after my visit she send me a thank you note which was such a nice surprise!
Definitely giving this place 5 stars for the attentive staff and such a welcoming environment :)  thank you dennae!
Very easy group to deal with and made my loan and subsequent home buying process extremely efficient.
I couldn't be more pleased with the customer service i have received at this particular branch.
Always in good moods.
I would highly recommend banking here !
Fast service and very pleasant experience.
Came in to do a cash advance.
Line was short little to no wait.
Asked my questions and the rep was very helpful with a pleasant demeanor.
Would recommend this branch.
Love the fact that they're open until 6pm on weekdays.
My husband and i have accounts here- he used to work for b of a, for 14 years.
This is the location where we have done the most business, since it's down the street from our home.
Though there are many people here, we seem to get out of here pretty fast.
The tellers are protected by a large wall of plexi-glass btw.
Some of the tellers know my husband and me, since we're regulars.
Eva was really nice- she was personal banker, but we haven't seen her lately.
The inside is a little dated and the floor is very wide open.
Saturdays are open until 1 pm.
The walk up atm is located on the front side, facing sahara avenue.
The drive-thru atms are located in back.
This is my bank that i use practically every week.
I usually will grocery shop and then either run through the drive thru or run inside if need be.
I've never had any issues here!
They just upgraded their atm to a brand new machine and it's really nice!
There usually isn't a line here, which is nice.
In all of the years i've been coming here, i've never seen the atm down.
I think this is huge, because most locations have their atms go down every once and a while.
Overall, i highly recommend this location!
Generally one of the better b of a branches w/not as much turnover as most.
Actually remember you & helpful.
Great location but pkg tricky...
Nicest branch i've ever been to!
The customer service at this branch is top notch!
I was helped by giovanni (i hope i spelt that right) and everything went perfectly.
I did a first time check deposit last night and it was cleared when i woke up.
Thank you for a great experience giovanni, you made something i usually would dread into a very positive experience.
Its the small things in life that make your day.
I love me some desert schools.
I struggled with banks for the longest time because desert schools did not have a business section.
It's charges for that, it's charges for this-that seems to be the way of the big business banking machine.
I couldn't be more happier!
I constantly and always will refer people to them without even thinking about it.
I was in tears today and i walked into the branch and left with a smile on my face.
Susan was amazing from the moment i sat down.
She really made me feel comfortable and took care of my situation.
I would say hands down the best banking experience i've ever had.
Before she went home she even called to make sure i was feeling better.
I was completely in shock but also wowed by that personalized customer service.
I'm one happy customer !
You made my day!
Erik was very professional throughout my time working with him.
He has great communication and kept me updated at all times.
He breaks down all the information making it easy to understand what is happening.
I would definitely use him again and will continue to refer friends and family to him.
I have received fantastic treatment from this credit union.
The drive through and indoor lines move quickly and the tellers are knowledgeable.
They are working to anticipate your needs.
This is a direct reflection on the person in charge of the bank.
I'm impressed, so much so that i actually spent 10 minutes to type this review.
Keep up the great work!
Moved to henderson in june from az.
She is always answering my emails with a fast reply same with phone calls.
Way better then my az location
Bill bright mortgage group were extremely helpful in guiding me through the entire process.
Ashley is a sweetheart and still offers her assistance any time i may have a question or concern.
I would definitely use their services again in the future and recommend them to any first time buyers.
They even mailed me a delicious box of brownies as a thanks for doing business with them.
:)  thank you bill and ashley!
If you need a home loan i'm not aware of a better option.
A competitor said they are never able to close within 30 days but they did on my loan.
The tellers here are great.
Occasionally there is a line.
Otherwise, great "bank" inside of frys.
I absolutely love silver state schools credit union.
They always have the best rates and the best customer service.
When i go to the main branch i always feel important.
Thank you for being the best at what you do!
Walked right in and up to his desk, asked if he was busy...no sit down he responded.
We talked about some financial scenarios, and i was in and out in no time.
I really love this branch.
You would think that it would be busier, but they always have 4-5 tellers working.
Great job b of a!
Thank you so much to this credit union.
I am from out of town.
Had to stop in a visit this location for some banking services.
I am extremely impressed with the level of customer service provided.
I was in and out quickly.
If i ever moved to vegas.
This would be the only branch i went to.
This branch is the best.
They always have the best customer service and the lines or drive through move quickly.
The branch manager and mortgage banker are so super helpful!
There's so friendly at this one as well and very helpful!
This branch has been very helpful to me and my wife.
I have had two auto and one signature loan with no problems.
We also have used their free notary service many times.
Ms. anna van gelder has counseled us many times on financial questions.
She is very friendly, professional, and thorough.
I recommend this branch to all my friends.
Smaller crédit union, but offers good rates on vehicles avid decent interest in savings.
If you are part of the banner health system i would recommend you open an account.
You'll appreciate their customer service and as an account holder, you become part owner in their operations.
I've been with desert schools for years and when we moved i was happy to find this branch.
I've read the other reviews and i've not had had the same experience.
Everyone i've encountered is friendly, respectful and very helpful.
They also have an atm at this location.
So far, i'm very happy with this branch.
I had a very pleasant experience dealing with claudia.
She explained the terms of the loan clearly.
I found the terms to be fair, even lenient considering the horror stories i've heard about regarding car title loans.
Last week i visited this bank to deposit cash in their outside atm.
After inserting nearly $500, the atm took the money, said transaction completed but failed to give me a receipt.
I immediately checked my account and the money had not deposited.
I went inside and spoke with an attendant you confirmed the money did not post.
She was the most genuine and professional individual.
Giving this bank a 5 star not because of their atm, but their exceptional team.
I enjoy banking with wells fargo.
Their staff is friendly, they have plenty of locations, and they have always treated me well.
This location is convenient for me to stop by when i'm going to the gym.
It has a drive-thru and a couple of atms on the exterior near the front door.
The bank is always clean and the people at this location always greet me with a smile.
As long as i have money in the bank.
I received an email today to congratulate me on my credit increase!
A credit increase after only 90 days!
Thank you credit one!
Great location in boca park.
My go-to chase when i'm staying at the suncoast.
Place is rarely busy, which is nice.
Large interior with two atms inside.
I've had a riverset/pittsburgh teacher's credit savings account since i was a child.
I like the personal feel that a credit union offers over a bigger banking institution.
I also like the competitive auto and home equity rates they offer to members.
At christmas time they offer a skip a payment which is great around the holidays.
Very honest & caring agent!
Sed and his staff always put customer service first.
Every time i call my questions and concerns are addressed immediately.
Highly recommend this office.
They go all out too, supplying all kinds of food and drink (also from the local businesses).
The manager, tellers, and personal bankers here have been extremely helpful in getting my accounts in order!
I do my banking at this branch whenever possible!
Always have good luck with usbank always nice and professional!
Great location and employees are very helpful.
I've had account for many years never a problem.
I don't care how long your debit card took...
I want to know where the f*** mine is.
Just opened a new account today.
So far i am impressed.
If you are going to buy a used car this is the first and last place to stop.
Just purchased a nice used sonata with the balance of the factory warranty on it.
Dan and audrey had my deal done in less than 30 mins.
I can't say i've ever been to a bad chase, they're the best.
This location is very very good, w charleston is naturally the best.
Keep up the good work!
Come in here and ask for robert if you're trying to open a new business account.
They are very friendly here at this location and have a lot of programs to help you get started.
Also was able to get my first order for checks for free.
They offer free night drop services, which i highly recommend if you have employees dealing with cash.
Would highly recommend and i experienced great service today!
She was very helpful and informative.
The branch seemed decent and everyone was very professional.
I didn't feel pressured to do anything.
Overall, the customer service was great and if i had to work with anyone it would have to be her.
John and his team are incredibly professional, knowledgeable, and responded within just a few minutes anytime i had a question.
When other lenders said no, john said yes, and found a way to make it happen.
I highly recommend john and will use him for all of my mortgage needs in the future.
Have been a customer for several years both business and personal.
I find them to be very customer oriented.
Work with the banks located on green valley and stephanie.
Originated the account at stephanie and have had nothing but good experiences with the manager cheryl.
I have been a member of desert schools federal credit union since i was 17.
I have always been happy with my service.
I used to come to this branch all the time when i lived close by.
The customer service is good.
I will say that when i got divorced and had no credit, they would not give me a credit card.
They had no programs for women like me.
I ended up going to another bank to get a secured credit card.
I was disappointed but my own bank did not have this option for me.
Fortunately that secured credit card option at the other bank worked out and i built my credit.
Now desert schools offers me credit cards all the time.
Today, 12/7/16, i had the pleasure of being helped by claudia in the west ann office.
She was incredibly efficient and helpful, and could fully answer all my questions.
I recommend this office to everyone.
There is no need to shop further for a title loan- this is the place, ask for claudia.
We were trying to give a jump to my cousin's car, and it took us a long time.
It was a hot humid day.
While we were trying to start the car, a young beautiful nice lady came with two cold bottle of water.
We were very thankful.
That was very nice and very thoughtful.
Honest, genuine, and intelligent.
Pretty much the greatest guy i know.
Being in his presence makes the colors brighter, the oxygen cleaner, and i can hear baby angels singing in harmony.
Great car insurance rates as well.
John werner is always available when i need him!
He is sure to make the mortgage process seamless and stress free!
You thought it was capital one?
That's your fault right there!
You're giving all your personal info to these people, maybe you should know who is receiving it.
On my first bill.
Good service  i've been a member of the credit union for nearly a year now.
I so far, it's been going very well.
I have a checking, savings, and ira account so i go to the credit union fairly often.
The staff are always helpful and friendly.
It took a short time to set up my account.
The facilities are quite nice.
Overall, i would recommend this credit union, over big banks.
I feel like the people here really have my best interest in mind.
I've never had any problems.
Thanks austin... you rock!!
I stopped by to make a deposit and then had to go get an envelope to mail a small package.
Took a chance and asked austin if he could help me... bam!
Not only did he give me an envelope, he also had some packing tape.
I was able to get it all done super fast and easy thanks to super austin at us bank.
Thanks for the friendly, great service guys!
As a claim adjuster myself with a cpcu, i can be a challenging customer.
Mr. estfan's office handled a water loss claim for my rental condo.
In a water loss things need to happen right away followed by lots of renovation details.
Pat estfan and his staff with state farm have provided us with exceptional service and a superior product.
This is just one example of the ways in which this bank stands out above the rest.
The staff here are always friendly and helpful.
Sometimes there can get to be a line but it usually moves quickly.
The atm branch is not as extensive as many banks, however.
This bank is excellent to use if you live or work near one of its branches.
She helped me find more discounts i didn't even know i was eligible for!
I also unvested in a homeowner's policy.
It's nice to know i'm safe on the road and at home.
Quick efficient service with minimal wait time!
Quick and painless on site!
Staff is very friendly and acknowledged me within two minutes of arriving.
I needed some legal documents notarized, and it's hard to get it done during the week with my work hours.
There's many other options to have it done, but some places charged $50.
I was able to get my document signed and notarized on a sunday and it didn't cost anything!
If anyone is looking for a new place to bank with great customer service, please check out us bank
Best bank in the land!!!
I've tried the other major banks and got nothing but fees fees and extra fees.
This credit union works for you!!!
From auto refi to small loans..you get the best rates.
Man this guy gave me info over and over again just to make sure i had it down.
They don't care how much time they spend with you...the bottom line is marisol cu is there to help.
Check out the mesa location also..roxanne is the bomb!!
I had a new account and my check deposited before i had to be back at work!
This company provides a low amount of credit at a high rate of interest for people with poor credit.
That is what they do.
The reviewers all sound angry, but i have had a good experience with credit one.
I paid off my bill in full after month one and they increased my credit line.
Read the terms, and if you agree, great, and if not, then don't get mad at a company about it.
People who struggle financially always get taken advantage of when there is a loan or credit involved.
This card is a stop gap measure to help those who are in the process of improving their financial situation.
This bank is inside fry's.
They are friendly and very helpful.
But at times busy when it's in the afternoon.
They also recommend things at times to you to help u invest and such.
They make you feel important.
They go beyond expected (in my opionion).
This is my go-to spot when i need documents notarized (a free service for u.s. bank account holders).
The employees at this u.s. bank are always very cordial and helpful.
The notary remembers me and welcomes me by name, even if it has been months since my last visit.
They do a great job of making their customers feel appreciated.
I love this bank.
Everyone is always so cheerful and eager to help.
The customer service is great.
They make you feel like you've known them your whole life.
I have been coming to this bank for years and i have never had a bad experience here.
The lines (if present) move quickly so the thought of going to the bank is not a dreadful one.
I am positive i will stay with this bank for years to come.
It's quite nice as they've three lanes for drive up tellers and one drive up atm.
I wound up cutting my payments by more than half and reducing my interest rate by almost as much.
But esther wasn't pushy about me doing that; she just seemed interested in helping me save money.
All in all, i loved working with this credit union and i thought esther was really sweet.
I wish i'd refinanced with them sooner!
Would definitely recommend this place to a friend.
Great place to come to so you dont have to get roobbed by casino atm's  very secure after hours.
Must stick card in to enter atm area.
And plenty of parking!
Perla answered all our questions, was professional, personal and very knowledgeable while working thoroughly and efficiently.
We felt welcomed, wanted and appreciated.
Sitting down to open new accounts was painless and simple.
I've never had a better experience with any other financial institution.
Thank you so much!
I have been with cculv for @6 or 7 years.
I have had excellent service since day 1.
I have financed several cars with them so this is a review of that department.
He even matched my interest rate on the loan i had just payed off!!
This is the service of concerned compassionate people helping others.
Thank you ky and thank you clark county crefit union!
I adore chase bank.
The atms are great.
It never fails me but my main focus is how amazing the staff is.
I had to handle some business a couple months ago and the man who handled my requests was wonderful.
He was helpful and answered every question and concern i may have had.
It was a great experience for me.
The atmosphere is beautiful as well.
This location is very new and lavish.
Its very appealing to the eye.
This particular establishment is the best!
I usually focus my yelp reviews on restaurants.
However, 3 months ago i decided to move my banking business from one of the local mega banks in pittsburgh.
I had always been a large bank customer primarily because mega banks have branches and atms all over the city.
Finally after years of lousy service and increasing fees i switched my accounts to first national.
I know it is hard to get excited about a bank...but wow!
That's enough about boring banks i will now go back to my more exciting restaurant reviews.
Very friendly lady at the welcome desk where i picked up my replacement debit card.
Always smiling and very helpful.
Only downfall is the wait time when trying to do anything else at this location.
I'll stick to the location in gilbert for any banking needs.
They are fantastic, friendly and fast.
Overall, wells fargo is a solid bank.
This review is meant to illustrate this specific bank location's accountability, which i found to be excellent.
I didn't believe it.
At this point i'm thinking the man who gave me his word had cost me $35.
Today, i stopped by the branch and talked to nadia again and the manager learned the situation.
She immediately reversed the fee because the banker had given me his word.
This is great news, and i'm happier to be with this bank because this branch honored their word.
Their customer service was great!
They helped me find what i was looking for.
Defiantly recommend this pawn shop to anyone that wants to find the best prices in town!
Love the "small bank" feel!
Been banking with them for about 14 years and despite the bank's expansion, it's still easy to deal with!
Great customer service, both over the phone and in person.
Wish there was an office in ca as i'd do all of my banking there!
My husband and i recently opened an account at one nevada credit union.
Our new personal banker is marco wilbowo.
He made us feel welcome and comfortable with our decision to keep our money at one nevada credit union.
I love that we got out debit card minutes after we opened the account.
The location has an atm inside and several drive thru ones.
I recommend that you check this place out and ask for marco!
I usually go through the drive through because i find it easier than standing in line.
Desire is a great agent, extremely helpful and provided excellent service.
I recommend them to anyone
Richard -  great guy and huge help.
Been with wells for 20 years.
All banks about the same, it's the interior business sector and the willingness to help you.
The effort of trying to solve problems or issues for you.
Shout out to rupi, my business rep.  super sweet and big help as wells.
Did a re-fi on our truck.
I brought the correct docs,was in and out in 30 minutes and knocked off 2 points.
I can not say enough about the level of customer service candise provided.
Cashier and banker were both awesome, friendly and helpful.
Served immediately (and quickly).
Feels great to receive excellent customer service, and these ladies didn't disappoint :)
I went to bank of america across the street first and was treated like garbage.
Whom i used to be a long time customer of for many years but left due to poor customer service.
Jacob helped me and he was fantastic!
Thanks for the help
My favorite branch, never confuse these folks with the school district personnel, they are so friendly and helpful.
What other bank or cu gives you a 5% rebate on your loans?
Ryan and rachel get special props for all their assistance and flexibility
I enjoy banking with chase bank as this is my home bank.
Overall service was good.
There's a safeway grocery store near-by, so it's in a great location.
I always liked this chase but i like it even more now.
They have added drive up banking and a atm to the outside.
The atm is 24/7 and the teller is available during normal business hours.
The bank is clean inside and the tellers have always been friendly towards me.
Great customer service at this branch!
Michael was super helpful and great with helping us everything we needed.
Very informative about all or questions and awesome customer service!!!
Thanks michael and chases boca park!
Absolutely amazing experience with fernanda at the banking department.
Thank you so much for making switching over to your bank an easy and seamless transition fernanda.
Brian is my all time favorite employee.
When ever i go in he always recognizes me and greets me , always smiling.
He always asks how i am doing and i tell him all about what's going on with me.
He processes my transaction fast and i never have a problem.
John was great to work with.
He helped us with refinancing our home.
He was very helpful and always available to answer any questions that i had.
He took the time to clarify any things i didn't understand.
Just an overall great experience.
I would recommend him to anyone!!
John at mortgage and credit pro did a fantastic job with our home refinance.
He was able to get us a lower interest rate, a shorter term, and lower payments.
He was also very professional and responsive to my emails and phone calls.
I would definitely recommend his services to anyone looking for a home loan.
Started using this us bank on w. lake mead about two months ago and have enjoyed superior service since.
Always go into bank, staff is always friendly and attentive.
They have even kept up interacting with my husband and his dry, corn-ball humor.
Keep it up, us bank, i'm counting on this level of service on a regular basis!
Help me establish new accounts for bill pay, help me save money for the future!!!
Not to mention the cute teller girls!!
I get to pay my bills online so i'm a fan.
Kevin thornton provided excellent service today during my visit to u.s. bank.
He went above and beyond.
Great business specialist to work with!
They updated me weekly and often times more.
This is not the first time i've had listing agents pleasantly surprised by the smooth transaction either.
Thank you bright for taking care of my loan and making my families dream home a reality
Store has a great selection and friendly staff.
Carla helped me find what i was looking for, ensured it's what i truly wanted.
I'll do business with them soon.
Nice friendly and fast.
Is not your usual bank behind big thick glass.
You actually sit at a desk with the banker.
Kind of a nice change.
I have been a member of the credit union since 1986.
I have had basic accounts, car loans, and other loans and have gotten the best interest rates around.
Never have had a problem.
Service is great too.
I am always asked when i go in (which is rare) if i need an extra check register.
That is really nice because i usually do!
Then they give me 2!
I've had an account with this credit union since i was born.
Always very helpful staff.
I also bought my 2012 ford focus from them.
Cars are very lightly used.
Got my car that it was only 1 year old and never had any problems with it.
He even threw in a free window tint for me.
I'm going back there soon to trade my car in for a bigger one.
It was a good experience.
I went to the bank to create a notarized document to fax to another bank regarding the disbursement of funds.
It was the best customer service experience i've had in long time.
Hopefully wells fargo monitors yelp and gives edward an attaboy or two so he hangs around awhile.
He is definitely an asset  to the business.
Walnut creek branch tellers and bankers are such a great bunch.
They make you feel like you could stay in the bank all day.
I would like to tell you the claudia is the best of all!
She was very friendly very outgoing very professional and i'm very pleased with her service.
Prompt customer service from my girl crystal!
Thanks for helping me out in such a timely, friendly manner!
Not one to give "shout outs" too much.
There is a lot to be said for just doing your job each day without fanfare.
However, my experience here was even better than the usually good experiences i have with td.
I came in here on a thursday after lunch.
Anthony was welcoming, straightforward, and handled my request as if it was the best thing he could be doing.
If there was anyone you could call "cool, calm, and collected", it was anthony.
I was frustrated with the line wait, yet left feeling completely satisfied and much more calm myself.
Very pleased with my service experience.
I came to this branch since it's closest to my family's house; expecting to get okay customer service.
Was greeted and helped by nathan!
I can tell you that he really took his time answering all my questions and concerns.
Didn't rush me at all.
And got to know me on a personal level.
I felt like i wasn't just a customer at this branch; but part of a extended family!
I left the branch very satisfied and happy!
Nathan; thank you so much!
You are an amazing and attentive individual!
Your customer service skill is beyond what anyone can expect.
And you make simple customers like me your priority.
I will deff recommend this branch to my friends and family and tell them to go to nathan.
Thank you nathan for helping me out!!
Wishing you all the success you deserve.
Because you deff deserve it.
You won me as a loyal guest!
I'm sure many others as well.
For the people the other reviews that complain.
Please go ask for nathan to help you.
I'm pretty sure you'll change your mind.
Representative nicole has been great with provided a few auto insurance quotes for me.
This was my first call to a company for a quote.
I am still researching the best rate and reputable company.
Nicole is very pleasant and her customer service is appreciated.
Big bank but very little personal touch.
He's as good as it gets!
Sed poche has been my insurance agent for the last 5 years on my home and auto.
His agency has had my life insurance since i was 25 (11 years).
He is attentive, professional and resourceful.
The reliability and honesty of this agency make them a pleasure to work with.
But the best part was the amount of money they saved me by bundeling my policies.
My overall savings were over 300 dollars per month.
Thank you sed and thank you state farm insurance!
The bankers here are very nice and friendly.
The best part is that one of the bankers remembers my name.
Would recommend to come here.
Really quiet and slow compared to other branches.
People are helpful and resolve my card problem the same day and got me refunded
I love this bank i've been banking here since 2006.
They have excellent customer service and they are very helpful when it comes to your needs.
Very awesome friendly service at this wells fargo.
The staff here smile and provide customer service like it should be.
Their staff has always been friendly with me.
Why do you have that much in a checking account anyways?
Should be able to get one through whatever investment group you use (i've been happy with vanguard).
As for the atm's you can use any credit union ones for free (summit, etc.)
Meaning that there are almost always free atm's in any part of the country.
So not quite as good as some other deals, but not awful either.
They also strike me as unusually fair.
I can't say enough wonderful things about this branch!
The manager is fantastic, the other employees are happy, enthusiastic, and efficient.
Not to mention that everyone there has impeccable manners and they treat their customers as customers deserve to be treated!
Go to this branch, you'll understand what i mean!
I opened an account here about six months ago and i could not be happier with my experience so far.
Fantastic individual and very informative for all of my needs and questions.
I did pick a excellently and fantastic credit union no doubt about it.
I've had great experiences at this branch with multiple associates - managers, tellers, and personal bankers.
Even if you do have to wait, the lobby and chairs are very comfortable.
The drive-up atms are great and i've rarely had issues with them.
They're also not very busy, so they're extremely convenient.
This has to be the nicest group of people i've ever dealt with at chase.
I always come here no matter what.
It's convenient because it's in the area, and i love that i can get groceries/bath products all in one trip.
If you're in this neighborhood, check this branch out.
This bank is two minutes from my house so i'm always there for any of my banking needs.
Very friendly and helpful employees every time i've come in to make a transaction.
I opened a small business account with tamala soboyejo at this location.
She was very professional, helpful and really funny.
I really enjoyed doing business with her.
She explained all my account details and completely walked me through the process of the account.
If you need a new account or just a smile and a good laugh then tamala is your person.
Staff is always helpful, friendly, and inviting!!
They are usually quick, sometimes the occasional slow teller.
They do a great job and i love the atmosphere!!!
I enjoy coming here!
Excellent customer service by sandie sanchez.
Her friendly and personable attitude was the exact reason i chose one nevada credit union.
This excellence is no accident and must be company wide.
This bank is family owned and it shows in the quality of service.
Everyone is very friendly, professional and knowledgeable.
I'm greeted with genuine smiles and pleasant attitudes every time i go in.
Even the phone representative was super friendly and pleasant.
I do online banking and direct deposit.
Have never had an issue with the website nor with the deposits not being posted correctly/on time.
I opened my account while they were having a promotion and the incentive money was promptly paid as promised.
I thought "well i guess the honeymoon's over" and expected a decline in service.
I am happy to say i was wrong.
I still continue to receive first class service.
The bank locations are very clean with higher end interior design.
This is banking like it should be.
Other businesses could use this bank as a perfect business model.
Oh yes.......very very few fees (other bank atms and those are refunded at the end of the month!
There's a drive thru atm and a in-person atm unit.
Other than that, no complaints.
It's a chase bank branch in scottsdale.
What could go wrong?
They directed us to marisol federal credit union in downtown phoenix.
I was helped by moises and he was great!
Very professional very helpful very informative.
I will totally recommend this credit union to my friends in az
I give one nevada credit union on n. durango and el capitan 5 stars hands down !
So great credit union, great staff!
Their staff is caring and very helpful , great customer service .
Definitely having my friends and family com over to sed !
He explains everything and always makes sure the customers are 100% satisfied.
Never had a bad experience here!
In fact there are two branches closer to my house and i choose to come to this one.
People are friendly and i'm usually in and out within minutes.
This office is very professional and courteous.
Thanks carl for a great team!
Thanks to ashley at the shadow branch for helping me!
She was able drop my payment on my vw saving $102.00 a month as well as dropping my interest rate!!!
All in a couple hours!
Her service was prompt and so helpful!
Kristen hurd was amazing!
If you need honest and genuine guidance she is the one!!
Bank of america occupies much of downtown charlotte and they have done an amazing job of making the area great.
The building is very secure, retina scanners, plenty of security.
Lot's of food choices, bars, safe area to walk around!
I've been here a handful of times.
Most of the time i go through the drive up atm.
I've also used the notary once.
I wish that was standard!
I've never had any issues at this location and staff is always friendly and eager to help.
It is quite busy at times since it's located in the heart of old town.
It's nice that they offer that instead of making you wait.
I would recommend to make an appointment ahead of time if you need one of those services.
She's always greeting customers when they walk in the door and is available to answer financial questions.
Everyone has been very helpful over the last 3 years i've banked with them.
I walked in today last minute and the two people helping me made my day so easy.
They offered water three times and asked if i needed anything while i waited.
5 star service thank you
I visited one nevada credit union last week and was extremely impressed with the customer service i recieved.
I was greeted promptly as i entered the door.
I felt like a vip.
Teresa was the representative that called me immediately to her desk and answered every question i asked.
The products/services that this credit union offers fits my financial needs.
Service at this location was fast and flawless.
I plan to take advantage of the 1.99% auto finance promo.
I like this particular location because the tellers are always very pleasant and quick.
I rarely go into banks since i prefer to deal with direct deposit and electronic transfer.
However, there is the occasion where i get a check from somewhere and need to deposit it.
It also gives me a chance to ditch work for a little bit; just don't tell my manager!
Thank you canyon state!
Donna echols was so helpful to both me and my boyfriend and myself.
I switched from us.bank
I always have a great experience at this location.
The staff is courteous, professional and always very helpful.
The great customer service is very much appreciated.
Recently looked at purchasing a second home and shopped around quite a bit.
Have used wells fargo and desert schools for smaller loans in the past and prefer desert schools.
They're local, they're service very friendly and we have been impressed with their attention to detail and to us.
This has been proven opposite at desert schools for us.
We appreciate their services and will continue to borrow from them in the future.
Thank you eric, jason and tyson for continuing to make it a positive experience.
This is my preferred chase branch.
They're always quick, friendly, and very competent.
They do notarization services for free too which is very convenient.
When we first met bill, we knew we were in good hands!
Bill explained the home-buying process with the upmost and honest professionalism.
He discussed everything clearly and is very straightforward so that it is easy to understand.
When there were questions, he went over them until we got it.
He goes above and beyond his duties and we would proudly recommend bill to everyone!
When i walked in i was greeted by literally every employee that was working right there in the front!
"hello welcome into u.s. bank" all in sync i was like oh wow lol.
Cool i guess that's better than not being recognized and greeted at all right?
One of the banker/tellers that assisted me had great energy and very friendly.
I was in and out within not even 5 minutes and that was actually on a friday!
I was impressed because even on my exit everyone said goodbye.. all together again lol.
Any who until then thanks for the great service!
Erika mchenry at this location is super nice, awesome, and provides amazing customer service towards her clients.
She has helped me numerous times and i felt obligated to share this review with everyone.
Thank you for being awesome!
Been a member for over 10years now and still a very happy client :d
First off, i don't think a lot of people know the definition of scam that are writing reviews here.
It's not surprising (and mostly likely not the banks fault) you're having trouble with this card too.
I've had this card for 7 years and no troubles.
Started with a $500 limit, crappy credit and now i'm at $2k and several other regular bank cards.
I only keep it open because it would severely drop the age of my accounts if i closed it.
I'm sure half their accounts are in some collection status.
If you're really paying with a debit card, just use your bank info and enroll in online payments (free).
It takes like 3-4 days to post.
I'm great full for credit one.
I only knocked a star off because automatic payments should be a must.
Me and the wife love this branch ....
Thought we'd lost our manager but mary bishop was moved around in a corporate shake up.
What an excellent branch!
Prenay and debra are outstanding people who care about their customers.
All of my family happily banks at this branch.
I have been banking with big commercial banking institutions for most of my life, but never again!
I have had a great experience with marco wibowo and onenevada since opening my account.
I was wrong about that.
If anything, onenevada's mobile app is better than i have used!
I love my branch staff is very friendly and its always very welcoming and other members are nice
I've banked with wells for well over 10 years including checking, savings and a home mortgage.
I have never been unhappy with the service i've received at wells.
By having the mortgage with them and keeping a reasonable minimum balance i get all my banking for free.
Wells has great online banking options and a very good mobile app.
I also love that there is a branch on every corner in las vegas.
I am absolutely pleased with the service i received at one nevada credit union.
It was easily the best service i have ever recieved from a financial establishment.
Friendly employees and short wait times, everybody at this location is great, friendly and very professional.
Auto loan  rate is 2.79% and no payment for 90 days not even a dealership can give you this deal!
Caitlyn is a great teller,  i typically see her.
If your sitting down with a banker, kimberly is good.
Overall,  this branch never disappoints.
They are knowledgable and aim to please.
Free coffee and water, lollipops for the kids.
I love how you can deposit cash and checks through their atms.
Even in the drive thru!
I absolutely love this credit union.
I would definitely recommend this place to my family and friends.
I've done most of my banking throughout my life with two institutions.
Chase, the megacorporation from chicago, and uw credit union, a non-profit organization that dominates the city of madison.
Uwcu: every single one of the above things is free.
I can't recall every paying uwcu a fee for anything.
Sure you can have a $500,000 mortgage!
We'll just distribute the bad debt to wall street and rob the shortfall from the government anyway!
If you do have bad credit they offer classes you can take as a prerequisite to joining.
Chase: two atms and one branch exist.
The two atms are usually broken, out of cash, or covered in garbage and spiderwebs.
Uwcu: tons of atms and three branches downtown.
Uwcu: prompts for a simple security question.
Impossible to manage my finances beyond looking at my recent history.
Chase: only open while you are at work, typically 9-4.
Uwcu: open on saturday mornings, and until 7 on weekdays, specifically so they can cater to worker bees.
Uwcu: friendliest, most helpful staff i have ever dealt with.
I don't believe i've ever been told "no, we can't do that."
Uwcu: no bullshit rewards that i never use anyway.
Dennae was extremely knowledgeable and friendly!
She helped me solve my problems and answered all questions regarding my account.
Cccu is lucky to have such an awesome msr!
Ing direct is my favourite bank.
I can say this with confidence because i have tried three different banks.
I love this location.
The service is great.
Since i found this location, i don't wanna go anywhere else unless i have to.
I always get greeting right the way when i step in or out of the bank.
If i can come here every morning to start my day from here i would.
Helpful, caring service, with smiles.
Tons of customer focused products.
I have banked here for years,  and i will be a life long customer.
Everything about this bank is a+.
They even have locations in supermarkets to make banking more convenient.
I prefer to bank in the us bank building where their top pros are ready for anything i need.
Other banks should study this bank's business model to see how it should be done.
When i walk in this bank, i feel happy knowing my money is in good hands.
I have never seen such a well run banking company in my life.
Use us bank and you will be a very happy customer!
My favorite bank hands down!
I went into this location to handle some business and the service was quick and exceedingly exceptional.
They are very informative knowledgeable about their services.
Only draw back is that this location closes at 5pm and there is no drive up atm.
Nice quick tellers with a manager always greeting on site.
As an employee of a merchant, i come in about once a month to get change.
The gentleman teller jose is professional, kind, and accurate.
Thank you for the consistent customer service!
I have been a member for several years and i am extremely pleased with the customer service at this location.
I have interacted with various employees and have never encountered anyone that is rude.
In fact, i find them to be extremely competent and accommodating.
They do a lot for the local community and i appreciate their commitment to local charities.
I've been with wells fargo for over 20 years.
To avoid this, i usually just park in the large parking lot that the bank is part of.
The banking hours are typical and they are open longer on fridays to accommodate pay days.
The bankers and tellers are always friendly and greet you with a smile.
I had a lovely experience at this wells fargo location.
I was helped by javier lopez and he was extremely helpful and knowledgeable about my questions.
He was very patient and kind and i'd recommend him to all my friends!
I've had a savings account here for a while.
I didn't have such a great experience in the past but went in to open a checking account.
If more businesses had employees like that, it would be a more enjoyable experience doing business.
Today i walked into the branch at its peak hour, the lines curved almost to the door.
I was extremely satisfied, even amazed by the service.
I want to thank alejandro for truly a professional service.
Crystal is excellent and her customer service is one of kind superb.
I enjoy her knowledge about all the products available for my financial needs.
Marisol is a great credit union.
2) they switched debit card providers to a card that was flimsier.
The $10 fees for when they're cracked were adding up.
So if the thieves rack up some expensive online purchases, that could be an issue  4) they have limited branches.
Their clientele is primarily maricopa county employees, and the most convenient branch was shut down.
As i mentioned, their service when it comes to loans is outstanding.
Even for the credit challenged.
It's a good place to have a savings account should you need loan services.
But it can be a bit challenging to have a checking account with them.
If you're aware of the drawbacks and are okay with them, jump aboard.
I used uwcu when i lived in wisconsin, primarily when i lived in milwaukee and madison.
The differences between uwcu and major banks in the atmosphere, value, and services is incredible.
I hadn't given it much consideration until recently.
Even now, living on the west coast, i've still maintained my uwcu membership.
Every now and then i'll have to call them for something, as i did today.
The people on the other end are always cheerful and helpful.
Such a nice change from the usual customer service phone experiences.
Keep up the good work!
I came here to simply deposit a cheque into the atm after hours when td was closed.
Nothing special about this process.
They were all sitting in a circle singing the lego movie song.
:d everything is awesome!!
Everything is cool when you're part of a team!
I hate and love this song lol.
The energy was quite infectious!
I should come to this td more often.
Sandie sanchez introduced herself to me and she took the time to explain to me the different account options.
Over the next week i had some follow up questions and sandie was quick to call back and explain.
Imagine that...calling a bank and speaking to a live person.
So i set up an appointment with sandie and she set me up with my accounts.
I am looking forward to doing more business with one nevada.
Ryan is extremely knowledgeable and helpful every time i have spoken with him.
You can truly tell he is passionate about his line of work and takes pride in what he does.
I highly recommended anyone interested in opening an account or has an existing account, to go see him!
We recently refinanced our mortgage and working with john was overall a positive experience.
At the end of the day john always responded to questions with answers or suggestions.
He never stopped taking my calls, even when things got muddy, and i wasn't always level headed.
The fact that the lines of communication always remained open is the only reason we got done and closed.
Whether by email, call or text he was always available and for that i'm grateful.
I will happily recommend to others.
Everyone is very nice here, and quick to help.
I recently just got a new car loan and leesa was amazing with the process.
Everything went smooth and fast!
I came into the bank to get a new debit card and pin set up on my bank account.
Personal bankers annette and lilian were both super helpful and pleasant to work with.
The bank greeter was also very friendly and helpful.
I've been a wells fargo customer forever and this might be my favorite branch!
We've been members for 3 years and counting with cccu .
This branch is the one we always go to and we definitely get great service here.
Shout out to dennae and all the staff for always having service with a smile!
We are very lucky to have found john- he is extremely honest, diligent, knowledgeable and hard working.
We will definite use him again
We have been with cccu for about two months now and couldn't be any happier.
Everyone at this branch has been so helpful!
Not only did we move all of our banking, but ended up refinancing our cars here as well.
She is who sent us to lena to get our cars refinanced.
Lena was amazing and made the entire process smooth and seamless.
We are so glad that we switched!
Def recommend to everyone.
This is a particularly nice branch within the thousands that wells fargo offers.
The service is wonderful, but try to avoid coming in the late afternoon: the line gets crazy.
Ever lose your bank card?
It sucks having to wait for a new one in the mail for a week.
Sometimes too, you have a serious need for it.
I needed a card fast since i'm going on vacation and my wallet was stolen.
This branch can make debit card replacements on the spot!
Go sit in the blue seats and wait to see a banker, not line up to the teller.
I was out of there within 10 minutes!
Close to my house and can save me from card frustrations - this branch is a lifesend.
Had this guy as an insurance agent for multiple years.
Handles transactions like it's a small town firm.
Have multiple cars, home and rental properties.
Hands down first rate in service and can't beat the cost.
His staff is first rate and always knows the answers to the questions.
Wouldn't go anywhere else
My parents opened the account for me and put $50 in to start me out.
This place was also where i got my first credit card.
And first car loan.
Then it was the first time i paid off the car too.
Now they financed my first cab for my taxi business.
So yeah lots of fond memories.
This branch is very convenient and centrally located in tempe.
Tscu as a whole is a great financial institution.
I don't pay checking fees.
They have been good about waiving any overdraft fees.
They always have great rates.
I downloaded an allpoint app to tell me where all those atms are at.
Take that big banks!
I was worried because of all the negative reviews.
I have had the credit one bank card for 2 months with no problems at all.
I use my card to purchase items, then i pay my bill.
My local financial center.
Also did an awesome job of thoroughly explaining the benefits my relationship and account types give me.
Always great service here.
I've been banking with desert schools, now desert financial for about 12 years and i've had nothing but good experiences.
Their rates are better than any of the big banks, and they aren't sleazy blood suckers like bofa or wf.
I have a safety deposit box here and never have a problem with the service at this location.
I've had the pleasure of walking in this branch and meeting michael.
He's the branch manager and he assist me with opening up an account.
It was such a pleasure for him to take the time and show me those things.
The staff was great too
Its a bank and they haven't pissed me off so i will give them 4 stars.
It must suck being a bank, who would go out of their way to right a nice review?
We attempted to get a loan from bofa in 2012 for our first home - a new construction condo.
That experience was horrible and we ended up almost losing the condo because bofa could't meet their promises.
Bill stepped in and completed our loan in 14 days.
Our second loan was a breeze.
We have always found them to be upfront, extremely knowledgeable, responsive and efficient.
We will never use any other lender again.
Today i came in with my boyfriend to start off his account with desert schools and to deposit a check.
He also added the referral program info so we could get some extra cash!
He was super helpful, caring, and funny!!
He has an awesome personality and it was a pleasure talking to him.
We enjoyed coming in today and felt in no way rushed or unhappy.
This branch is located inside of albertsons-osco on tatum and shea.
Always helpful and super friendly.
The bank has access to an atm, lines inside the branch are never long.
Great banking experiences here.
I have been dreading opening an account for quite some time.
I always just use cash everywhere.
But after visiting the branch today and was fortunate enough to have sandy helping me ...the experience was actually pleasurable.
The only thing i didn't like was she said she is always at a different branch.
It's nice to know if you have concerns or issues that person will more than likely be there.
Anyways i have no issue with bank of america nor the service at this location!
One of the better ones for sure!
Great bank and great people!
We were helped immediately and we were helped by a good guy named gilbert.
He was very accommodating and willing to do everything we needed to get done.
All of the people are friendly and all have personalities.
I wanted to shoot you an review and let you know what an asset aj is to your company.
I'm sure you already know, but he has been fantastic from the get-go.
He's a personable guy and these days, that can make all the difference!
Please set him up for any awards you might have there or promotions, etc.
I can't be the only one raving about his work.
Always appreciated and keep it up you guys!
I had a issue with a loan officer there and bill bright went over and beyond to make things right.
He understood and listened to me on the situation.
By him responding and wanting to make me feel comfortable means a lot.
Alexis was also great listening to me and making sure i was taken care of.
Sometimes as realtors we do not get that treatment from management at a mortgage company.
Ryan reached out to me today too wanting to let me know more about the company services.
Bill, alexis, and ryan rock!!!
If your in need of a title loan come to usa money they have low rates and great customer service...
The group that works here are very helpful and have frequently gone above and beyond my expectations.
They have been a notary multiple times.
They are very professional and have demonstrated great customer service.
I've always done banking with chase since i was a kid.
Compared to other locations i've gone to,  this location has friendly staff.
I've dealt with the drive thru tellers, inside tellers, personal bankers, and their investment banker.
All of them were very helpful and friendly.
Very refreshing to be treated like a human (: great customer service and no bullet proof glass.
Feels like a financial institution rather than 24 hr checks cashed and payday loan/boa(:!!
Sandie made my experience quick and painless.
I enjoy stopping by this branch as i usually do not encounter a line inside.
Note: all branches offer coin counting for all customers and it is free for cmcu account holders.
The process is quick and easy and the kids get a kick out of it.
Your staff at the north el capitan branch has been excellent!
They all deserve great recognition from the effort they have put in to keep me as a member.
Please go in and give them all high-five's and lollipops, or some kind of reward.
They have been fabulous and deserve a treat.
This location primarily handles business accounts.
The employees are always super duper friendly!
Not much else to say but over the past ten years i have banked with wells i have zero complaints.
Never had an overdraft or other "issues" so i have no clue how they handle issues such as those.
:)   very nice company!
This is the main us bank location for phoenix.
They are very nice and helpful.
I have not had any issues with them.
I'm going to continue to bank there, they do a great job.
I have been a state farm client since i began driving at 18.
I've been with state farm, pat estfan's office, since moving to arizona in 2003.
I honestly wouldn't think of trusting my insurance needs to anyone other that state farm!
Bill bright and his team were truly amazing from beginning to end.
Apparently they had my docs put together perfectly because i only had 2 underwriting conditions that were extremely simple!!!
I would absolutely recommend them in the future and will definitely be using them again myself.
The ladies here are always so helpful.
I've had credit one for a year and half and i've never had one problem with them.
I started with them to help build my credit after a bad divorce.
Yes, the interest rate is pretty high and there are better.
No, you can't really ask for a credit limit increase, but that's ok.
I have a limit over $1,000 and with two other cards over $1,500 and $2,250.
My credit rating is almost hitting 700 and i just bought a new home.
I'm not sure they refuse payments considering i've made payments the day the bill became available.
Yes, i did think they were a capitol one account at first (and i have two of them).
I have never had my account threatened or received threatening phone calls.
I've never had my card hacked either.
Everyone's experience with credit one will be their unique experience, but mine has not been bad at this point.
Oh how i love my sweet little bank.
I always get a warm welcome when i walk in.
I've only been a member for a year but i will never use anyone else.. well unless i move.
Can't get better than that and everyone loves that cute popcorn stand right when you walk in.
Very convenient location near kierland and scottsdale quarter shopping areas.
The drive up atm and teller windows are perfect for banking on the go.
I've never walked inside because i don't have to here....perfect.
Return factor - 90%
They actually dont care at all.
Dont waste your money on the $20 a month fee and go somewhere else.
Update: i spoke to liz through email and she was very helpful.
Resolved my problem with no issues at all.
As long as there are some people in this bank that actually care about their customers ill be staying.
Thank you to liz for your help.
The staff here is amazing!
They are always super helpful and whenever i have any questions regarding my policy they are always there to help!
Wouldn't trust anyone else !
Nice, professional bank right off scottsdale and thunderbird.
The couple times i've been to this location they have not been busy and i have not had to wait.
I went inside today and chris helped.
He is very sweet and professional.
Great employees, especially chris!
Thanks for the service :-)
Karen and ron go out of their way to help.
What would have taken me days (maybe weeks), karen did in less than 24 hours.
I highly recommend them.
I recommend john completely.
I came across john's name on a search for reasonable jumbo loans.
They have a helpful customer service centre and ship new cards quickly.
They also have high security and disable access to online banking while you are waiting for a replacement card.
They also send me a 150 cash advance check as a credit limit increase which i loved!
I recommend this company!
I've been coming here for business and personal banking for three years.
The staff is always friendly and helpful.
There's never a long line here either, in and out.
Same thing with the drive through.
See tatiana for a business account.
She is super nice and always has time to talk.
Thank you all for taking care of my banking needs.
Ever since we opened an account the staff have always been helpful and welcoming.
We've had nothing but good experiences with the staff at this branch!
Nicest crew and super helpful!
Forget the huge chains, these guys get my business from here on out!
I came at opening and there were just a few people ahead of me.
I only waited about 5 minutes before it was my turn to go up to the teller.
The teller was super friendly and was able to help me out immediately.
She made small talk and always had a smile on her face.
So, it's always nice to go somewhere and the employees are pleasant.
I was in and out within 10 minutes!!
A record for me.
Would definitely come back to this location if i was in the area.
Most locations i've been to here in vegas always look like the homeless people just live at the bank.
My clients receive the best rates, programs and professionalism from the beginning to the close!
Let's just say they're not exceptionally warm here, however.
Rob rodriguez helped me today, i had some savings bonds to deposit that were needing my  grandmother's death certificate.
Clean branch, fast service and good location.
Right next to starbucks with easy access off loop-101 & indian school road in the far west valley.
Crystal @ the green valley branch really took care of my banking and checking needs.
She took the time to explain the fees and which product was right for me.
She also walked me through the online banking and the perks of being a credit union member.
Thanks crystal @ the green valley branch for taking care of me and my family!!!
Very friendly and approachable!
I just love going into just about any mid-first location, but this was great.
They treated me like a king, and helped me with my debit card issues in a thorough, effective manner.
I believe he's really spot on with this and i sometimes sympathize with the customer service side of my bank.
Under her breathe she was spouting obscenities at how slow the line was moving.
It was moving slow, but it wasn't like the tellers were sitting around zoning out.
They were helping customers and sometimes that takes time.
Is a reassessment in order?
I have always had great service here.
The tellers are competent, efficient and personable.
One time they gave me a number of cheques (200) without charge.
Don't get me wrong, i am not a real fan of banks in general.
However, when it comes to customer service this branch is usually on.
Long story short  that person was miss claudia.
That day i took the loan never rushed and even given alternative places to seek a loan by miss  claudia.
That is to say if you go elsewhere than here and see claudia.
Actually i don't know for sure but why chance it.
110% +110 i recommend this place when in need of a little help.
So go get a loan and mention my name .
Had great service here, bank associate was very friendly and most are bilingual here.
I've never had any bad experiences here.
All the options work on their atms.
They have always been extremely friendly and helpful including the managers.
They greet you with a smile when you walk in and/or approach them.
They're knowledgeable and have all the answers you need to know when you ask them questions.
My favorite bank hands down.
I am always greeted with smiles, and on a hot day a bottle of water.
I have a personal banker!
Yeah, that is correct!
I am not a millionaire by any means, but midfirst bank makes me feel like one.
Heidi is a wonderful and friendly person.
She came to my office to introduce herself and drop off some banking information.
Do yourself a favor, and drop that big bank!
This is a big bank with hometown values and feel!
Marco wilbowo is by far the best personal banker ever.
He emmulates excellent customer service and truly cares about your banking needs from a-z.
I knew i had the right creditmunion and personal banker.
I instantly gor my debut card and he set up the bankimg app on phone.
Atm is inside and that is convenient.
He knows the banking industry and his goal is to ensure your banking amd financial needs are met.
He makes sure you aware of all the services they provide.
I am excited to have to have such an amazing personal banker and credit union.
Thanks marco, you're the best.
Everyone here was polite and greeted us.
I originally gave a 1 star but updated to 4 because they redeemed themselves today.
John worked hard to help me finance a new house despite my less than stellar financial history.
He was honest, fast, and responsive to all of my questions.
He   was very good at working and communicating with me to get everything accomplished without disrupting my work schedule.
I couldn't be happier with john.
No longer ing direct - as of april 2014 tangerine is still a great place to bank.
Not exactly as punitive as the other big banks, but still not the same warm fuzzy it used to be.
I expect other changes, but still better than the big banks by leaps and bounds.
Right now, if you refer a friend, and a friend opens an account with $$, both of you get $50?!
Every customer has an orange key (14650267s1 if you want to use mine), and we both get some love.
Tfsa's - you can earn interest on them in advance of the tax year!
I've saved hundreds of dollars in fees already, and earned plenty more in interest.
I put my property tax $ in here - why should the city get the interest by paying them monthly?!
No thanks, i'll just hang on to that cash.
No fee chequing with the thrive account, gic's and other investment options exist as well.
Atm banking you now have access to all the scotiabank atm's including the ones in 7-11 stores.
I do 99.9% of my banking online, occasionally i have to call, and they have really excellent customer service.
Welcoming and sincere customer service is truly refreshing.
They always greet me with a smile, and make me feel at ease.
Keep up the awesome work!
Always a 'hello, how are you', ask about my family, etc.
Although i was frustrated at what was happening zachary made the experience great.
Thanks for you patients
The employees at this branch always make you feel your business is valued!
This is a good branch.
Jose is the greatest!
The branch manager is friendly as are all employees.
I always only use the atm here!!
Super easy and quick!
I always forget i have no cash and pop over here from the nearby stores.
Its quick, easy, and always open!
The service from suzie drinkwine was excellent.
She was very informative, friendly and professional.
I would definitely recommend this company and branch for banking!
We have done business with this pawn shop a few times and highly recommend it.
Rahul always takes exceptional care of our needs and provides amazing customer service.
They have a great variety in store to choose from as well.
If you need anything, make sure to ask for rahul, he will be sure to take good care of you!
I have had nothing but the best experiences at this branch!
They have online banking and are more than willing to assist with anything you need at anytime!
I wouldn't bank anywhere else!
Love this place nothing but good deals!!!!!
I have made some big purchases there and i have no regrets.
Very good quality items for the price i purchased.
Justin was super helpful and so was indy.
I felt bad coming in to close an idle savings account that i no longer needed.
The staff here were super nice and made me feel comfortable.
After that he did his magic and closed out my account.
I just had to take the slip he handed me to the teller to get the money.
Present my id and bam, i was done in five minutes.
My first yelp review of a financial institution.
What can i say?
It's a credit union.
I've been with them for many years.
My other bank is usaa.
Minor i know, but it cost a star!
Friendly staff, fairly efficient drive through, although i hardly use it any more.
Coolest thing, the drive thru atm gives out $50 bills when you take out a larger sum of money!
That's all i got on this.
Opened two accounts with marissa, she was very thorough & very nice !
Was a pleasure working with !
A great banking institution and have always received exceptional customer service.
Happy with services provided.
Better than any past banking experiences.
Been with azfcu for 18 years.
Very clean banking branch.
The greeting and service on this first visit was fantastic!
I must say, this bank is the friendliest bank i have ever seen.
It's almost over-the-top how everyone greets you like you won the lottery when you walk in.
They also have a drive-thru with an atm.
They have made me feel valued even when we moved to monticello, ut and we did business by phone.
I love credit unions and this one is a keeper.
John moran was quick to respond to inquiries.
He made my first home buying experience easy with his ability to respond quickly and accurately to all my concerns..
I love dawn she helped me set up a bank account and refinance my car.
She did a speedy and friendly job.
She truly works hard to help me out and i'm pleased i picked this bank.
The tellers here come across as warm, friendly, and solution-orientated people.
They seem to really welcome and embrace the unique village community.
My dog likes coming in too cause she always gets a biscuit.
Excellent customer service from teresa popp, i look forward to making this location my go-to branch.
This branch was very helpful when i was transferring my accounts to arizona.
Soon i will be checking them out for mortgage loans.
I'll check back in at that time.
Banks are the enemy, why am i being nice to them.
Because they were nice to megs, that's why.
Arrived at nooner to get a bank draft, line up was juicy but went quickly.
Bank is nice, bright, very close to train station just off 7th avenue.
Across from shoppers drug mart.
Young fellow at the counter was nice, friendly, helpful, and answered all my questions.
He even offered me alternatives when i complained slightly about the 7.50$ draft charge.
That was cool though, that he did that.
Overall, i was very pleased to gain faith once again in the teller man.
I initially went to the decatur/215 location to set up a trust account.
We have been banking with a different credit union for over 20 years and were apprehensive with changing our banking.
However we received great service from the minute we entered cccu.
Dennae was very friendly, patient and professional!
We are less apprehensive of the transition to cccu due to the great service we received.
I really like this location.
They are open until 6.
The staff is friendly, knowledgeable and fast.
All in all a great branch.
This branch is perfect for me.
It's close to my place and the staff is always very professional and courteous every time i go in.
Never had a problem with this branch yet.
Plus it's close to i-15 so you can get around to other parts of the city fairly quickly.
I recommend this branch.
Ing direct is cool in the way no banks are cool, because generally banks aren't very cool.
It's a unique place: like ing's banking philosophy, it's not your traditional branch.
I've been a customer of ing for years, and i really appreciate their human approach.
See you again soon, guys!
It was just an easy in and out straight deposit transaction and the line wasn't that long..
I was satisfied that day..thanks
The service is always prompt and the tellers are well-trained.
No complaints here but minus one star because no extraordinary friendly service
They were able to squeeze me in between there busy schedule.
It was a pleasant experience.
Helped us out a lot.
This location doesn't have a drive threw but i don't always need one.
Great bank coming back for sure.
We've been with azfcu for 25+ years and they are great.
I am so thankful not to use a big commercial bank.
The staff us always helpful and friendly.
Love all the perks we get with them too.
Nice to have a no fee atm and the drive up moves fast.
Really excellent customer service!
Everyone was super friendly, and the woman who helped me (heidi) was really great.
This chase has been the best one i've been to yet!
Went in there with the questions i had, and left satisfied with the answers i received.
Definitely gonna be my go to place whenever i need to handle anything with my chase account.
I have been using cccu for about 6 months now and it was the best move.
They are super helpful at this branch, specifically speaking to sharwani.
I would recommend them to anyone looking to open a business account and even a personal account as well.
Shawarni is always available via email or call making things easy to manage.
As with any credit card- read the information that comes with the card!
They are also very upfront about interest rates and other various fees associated with use of this card.
Previous issues with credit should make someone more cautious to read the fine print!
I've had no problems with this card as i knew what i was getting into.
I may even begin keeping a small balance to help my credit score increase faster.
Alex was very nice and knowledgeable, he was patient and help with all the questions i had.
Everyone at this branch is awesome.
Donna is super awesome as well   this is my favorite branch
Love midfirst, what can i say?
Always in and out quickly and such nice friendly faces every time we need to go in!
I had to use usamoney for an emergency.
When i called and talked to claudia she was very nice and informative.
Donna c las vegas
Have been with this credit union for several years and never had an issue until yesterday.
Once i explained what my issue was, she got busy trying to fix it.
She checked my phone, allowed me to try and log in on her desktop and still nothing.
She asked me to call her if it wasn't fixed by this morning, well, checking this morning, yay!
It is working and back to normal.
Thank you ms. mcgahee for taking so much time trying to help and finally coming up with a solution.
I will continue to be a customer because of employees like this branch manager.
The branch is fine  - the national service sucks.
Very friendly and helpful.
We were treated with respect by matthew and caitlin.
I wanted to write a well justified review for your amazing loan officer sandie sanchez.
Meeting her last night when signing the finalized documents was great!
She has a fun, bright smile, with a great personality!
Thank you sandie for what you do!
She obviously knows what she is doing...
So a raise is needed at that branch for this lady!
This will always be my only bank, i go out of my way for this particular branch.
Service is always swift and friendly.
My experience has been amazing.
Claudia is professional and kind.
Hands down best loan place in las vegas.
If you want good and fast service on a loan and so happen to be around the area.
One nevada gives me exactly what i want from a financial institution...efficient, reliable, and cheerful service.
The staff will take the time to thoroughly answer whatever questions i have.
Lamise and mindi are the best!
Their customer service is fantastic.
Chase got it right with these two.
They are definitely key employees.
She is honestly so amazing!!!
Very very professional & entertaining when helping you.
Everyone in there is very friendly as well!
I honestly recommend this bank 100%!!
I have been with wells fargo for many years and to different branches.
So most of my banking is done on-line.
They are always helpful and polite and it is a pleasure to deal with them.
Some of them sound pretty hot also.
I've been with riverset for a few months now after leaving pnc due to their investment in the dapl.
I'm using their simple checking account, simple savings account, and payback plus credit card (2% cash back on all purchases!).
You also earn a bit of interest in the checking account, which is nice.
But, ultimately, they all work and do their job.
I haven't had any issues with paying bills, redeeming cash back rewards, etc.
One other slight annoyance is that their online banking does not connect to mint for account aggregation.
I would have liked to have seen that.
Overall, aside from the clunkiness of the online banking, i really have no complaints about riverset.
Needed help and i found this business on yelp.
Definitely not what i expected.
Very kind and understanding.
Moved to area from wa state.
Becca akana helped me navigate services and open accounts, set up services needed/wanted.
She was awesome, very patient and very knowledgeable and responsive to my questions.
I think i will be very satisfied with one nevada cu.
This branch is inside frys.
Open till 7pm and for this i love them.
This info just might help you one day..your welcome.
Personally i love credit unions.
No fees, great rates for car loans, and this particular location has the best staff.
Always friendly and helpful.
Their customer service stands out.
My family and i have worked with this company for many years.
My parents were on the verge of losing their home after my mother was diagnosed with cancer.
John helped save their home from going into foreclosure.
I will forever be grateful for that.
I finally got to where i needed and refinanced at a better rate.
I really feel john has his customers best interest at heart.
Through this process, most things were able to be done online which i loved because i'm so busy.
The process was smooth and quick.
I highly recommend using this company.
I am a policy holder with your team, for auto, rental and life insurance.
I recently added my son on my policy, as well.
They also helped in keeping me informed of my claim and reimbursed me for towing charges.
I didn't know i could get that money back.
I was so happy.
Brandon and nery are an asset to your team as well!
They are always available to see me, if i just pop in for something.
Never make me wait to be seen or have to make a future appointment.
They both are always willing to help and make you feel comfortable like an old friend or family.
They have also expressed how happy they were with brandon's service skills and personal attention.
He takes the time to listen to the needs of his client and acts on it.
Kudos to your team!
Happy client, heidi ree
I have been using uwcu for more than 5 years for checking, savings, and credit card and i love it.
I switched over to uwcu from associated bank and i'm very happy with it.
The online interface is great and the service at the branches is superb.
Would recommend this credit union to anyone in the madison area.
Claudia was pleasant, respectful, and professional.
I highly recommend her if you are in need of a no-hassle title loan.
I very much appreciate the kindness and friendliness claudia provided me with.
I felt very comfortable working with her as she explained the process to me thoroughly.
Thank you again claudia!
I very much recommend her!
I can't say enough about how good the service i received was across the board.
I would recommend claudia to anyone looking to take out a loan.
Thank you so much.
Super friendly, efficient, helpful people.
Went in to open an account today and i am completely pleased with the service.
Great people to deal with .
I left the 2 banks i had business and personal accounts with and opened 5 accts.
The online banking is easy to use.
The staff  knows me by name, and has bent over backwards to keep my happy.
My sister worked with erik a few years prior and recommended that i work with him.
So sorry to hear about the serene location robbery today.
This is my branch (was just there twice yesterday) and i see these wonderful ladies all the time.
Its scary to think that even our little credit union is not immune to all the violence in the world.
Hoping for all the tellers, management and staff behind the scenes peace and healing.
Patricia is an excellent assistant and will hopefully never leave to run her own branch.
They are a full service bank with a great attitude...just ask lucy!
This review is based purely on location & not being a member of cccu.
The building is pretty big so coincidentally the parking lot is too.
There usually is someone to greet you upon entering the front door.
Some sort of receptionist desk.
Feels nice to be greeted.. especially on pay day star 2.
The tellers are extremely nice & helpful.
The facilities are clean.
This location in particular isn't lit very well inside.
It almost feels kinda gloomy.
Maybe open a window or .. five?
Replace some bulbs with new fluorescents?
Maybe it'll get that last shiny star then :]
Erik feldman has assisted my wife and me with closing two loans.
Erik is honest, dependable, hard working, and has a great attitude.
He communicates well by phone, text, email, and promptly returns phone calls.
He ensures all documentation is complete and in good order.
We enjoy working with erik feldman and recommend him with the highest regard.
We've been using sscu since 2008.
Our closest branch is stephanie street.
All employees there have given us great service.
Nicole hill helped us with our auto loan.
Although nicole moved to the main branch we do still use stephanie street and still receive excellent service there.
We understand nicole will soon be moving to the fraud department.
I have banked with wells fargo for years, and have had a very positive experience, in general.
The staff are always helpful and friendly!
Crystal saves the day!
On 6/6/17 i came to this branch for an appointment i had set the week before.
I came in to an empty waiting area and a representative working up front greeted me.
I explained i had an appointment with teresa.
I was then told she no longer worked at this branch.
I explained that my son was coming from across town to be added to my account a oncu.
She then stated "i will put your name on the list and maybe someone can help you".
One man had since come in and was waiting behind me.
My son arrived and i told him what happened and he suggested i move my account to another credidt union.
Then from out of the clear blue sky a hero arrives on the scene.
"she heard i had an appointment and was sorry for the inconvenience but could she possibly help me instead.
Her name is crystal.
She proceded to make us feel welcome and that she cared that we were customers there.
Let me tell you -  if not for crystal i would have pulled every dime out of that credit union.
Spoke to bank manager gustavo m. very helpful helped me get a mortgage.
Btw got a bank draft for 5k in under five minutes and they knew me by name.
Very professional and friendly.
Lets you know what is happening with the loan process every step of the way.
With my strange work schedule, he was the most understanding and helpful.
I would highly recommend this gentleman to do any of mine and your mortgage needs.
The one nearest to me at the time was the main branch in downtown calgary.
Mona greeted me with a genuine smile.
She asked me what i needed done and was an absolute delight to deal with.
Plus what was amazing is that she had me out of there in record time!!!
A big thanks to mona and to the entire crew over there!
Keep up the great work!
Seems legit to put my foot down when unnecessary service is being forced down my throat.
We all work hard for the money and i plan to stay in control of what i do with it.
Great service and the friendly tellers is just a plus.
On the mortgage side worked with rebecca and ryan.
I had another lender competing with them, and they blew them out of the water.
I would recommend anyone to refinance through one nevada!
He also took cash out for me too when i asked!
I've read the past comments and simply do not agree.
This branch is very friendly and helpful.
I will continue to stop into this branch and suggest that you do the same:)
The employees at this branch are simply amazing!
Also to have a personal banker is quite nice.
Frankie has been so wonderful.
He is always there willing to help in any way possible.
I will be a long time chase customer mainly due to this branch.
I love my bank.
I really, really do.
I don't know of anyone else who says that, ever, so i'll say it again.
I love my bank.
I've been with them for eight years and i've never been dissatisfied.
Everyone's always very friendly and helpful.
You don't have to be employed by a nevada school to be a member.
If you're related to a member of the bank, you can be a member.
Also, if you want to belong so badly, if you donate to vegas pbs you are eligible for membership.
And you should donate to vegas pbs cause...uh...i work there.
Fair rates compared to most airport currency exchange companies.
Very kind employee who served me!
Will do business here again if i get the chance.
Located in the village circle center trails shopping plaza, this wells fargo is pretty nice.
I walked into the first u.s. bank that i've ever walked into today.
This was the location that i went to.
I was there to open an account and i'm glad i did.
My account has a lot of up-to-date features that i didn't know existed.
Sorry if i sound like i live in prehistoric times but they have an overdraft protection that is really awesome.
I previously banked with one nevada credit union and i did so for many years.
But at least at first glance, u.s. bank has been a good choice for my future banking needs.
Another thing that i like in particular about this bank is that the teller and customer transaction happens sitting down.
That being said, the chairs they provide for every transaction come in handy.
Love this place, we need to make a deposit employees were friendly and had a positive attitude
Nice clean place, just off the i-17.
Services my credit union from california, very easy to work with.
No problems at all.
The cmcu locations that i have visited (sunset and harris blvd) are very nicely kept.
On this trip, i needed to speak with a representative but elected not to wait.
I can always call the customer service number for prompt assistance.
Service seems to be simple and uncomplicated.
I really like cmcu.
If you live, work,or worship in mecklenburg county, you can join!
I have been a member for about two years now and i have no complaints.
Online banking is greatly improved from two years ago so i am a pretty happy member.
Donna is excellent at her job she is experienced and knowledgeable she helped me and i was grateful
Bill bright and his team with afn are the most knowledgeable, professional, and honest mortgage experts one can find.
My last three mortgages were all completed through the bright mortgage group.
I've dealt with many mortgage brokers and loan officers and none can compare to or deliver like bill's team!
I highly recommend bright mortgage group to anyone who desires a smooth and worry-free mortgage financing.
The tellers inside are friendly.
Never an issue with service at this branch
Dennae helped me open accts needed for the refinance.
They are both very professional and a pleasure to work with.
I'm so sorry to this wells fargo branch.
I have been here numerous times since my initial review and i can't believe i only gave them 3 stars!!
They are so accommodating as well!
This is my new favorite wells fargo branch in the city!
I have been with cccu for almost 5 years and can't say enough good things.
I live in arizona and christine tassone is still my 1st call for anything.
If you are looking for a financial partner.
Cccu and christine should be your 1st and only call
Everyone knows how hectic bank depots can be.
I come in here to handle merchant transactions for work.
The customer traffic is hit or miss.
The staff that work here have been 99% accurate.
At two separate times, the teller shorted me a dime roll, and another time gave me an extra dime roll.
They actually called to say they shorted me.
They definately greet upon walk-in so vibrantly.
Great customer service, attractive decor and location makes this td branch stand out among the city's best branches.
Used to make deposits here for work.
All of the ladies who work here are really lovely.
This is one of the finest credit unions in the country.
I am an investor and continue to rely on this establishment for clear and consistent business.
Very reliable and amazing for helocs
Sharwani has been an amazing source of relief of expected banking issues and keeping the cccu standard alive.
Thank you so much!!
I don't understand why people are complaining.
Credit one is good card.
I have no complaints with them.
Super nice and honest.
First time i ever pawned and i will be back if need to.
A very nice and profitable experience!
Told a few of my friends and they will give pawn1st a try.
I see all these negative reviews on this company however, i have never had any bad experiences with them.
I've had my visa and mastercard with them for almost four years now.
To dispute a charge, you'd have to write a letter and mail it to their main office.
They have a great staff and an awesome ceo who believe in what they are doing and love doing it.
When it comes to the banking industry, i'm usually pretty disgusted with the whole lot.
Despite being the sort of person who doggedly stayed with local banks (remember those?)
And credit unions, about eight years ago i somehow ended up a wells fargo customer.
Despite friends' warnings (isn't there a war story about every bank?
), i did the lazy thing and stayed with wf.
A bank that puts the spirit of law before the letter of it?
Isn't good service so often the dealbreaker when it comes to choosing or staying with a bank?
That feeling that, should bad things go down, you'll be able to talk to someone who will really listen?
Great to work with!!!
I'll be recommending you to my family, friends, and coworkers.
The last few times i've entered the bank yolanda has been such a huge help.
She is so pleasant to speak with and makes the experience a lot easier.
Her friendliness and upbeat personality lightens the mood from a usual bank experience.
Her and all the other staff are always very friendly when i come in.
I was a bit weary when the teller machines were first introduced but they're very easy to work with now.
I always feel at ease when i leave thanks to everyone here
Will never go to a "bank" again.
Free atms at any credit union nationwide.
The place oozes sanity and unslickness.
We recently opened a new checking/savings account after moving from oregon to henderson.
We were looking for a smaller institution open to the public and found just what we needed!!
Shaylynn upshaw was extremely patient and helpful.
She walked us through everything and answered all of our questions.
Very happy with our choice!
So i wanted to put my 5 cents worth and give bmo a nod.
I don't think anyone understands the point of this card.
Nor do they read about it before they get it.
It is for rebuilding credit, it is not american express.
They are not hidden fees.
If you don't like it then don't sign up for it.
So don't listen to all these people who chose to get a credit card without knowing anything about it.
One of the most friendly banks, staff rocks, debbie, dawn are great personnel unlikely other banks.
I have banked with chase bank my entire adult life.
The nearest branch is about 5 miles from my house, but with that said... it's worth the drive.
Extremely friendly and knowledgable staff.
Always greeted with a smile, and addressed by name.
The chase corporation should be extremely proud of this branch, as the customer service is top notch.
It is a pleasure to do my banking there.
Kristen was great for me getting me low car insurance and making sure i was taken care of.
My parents setup a bank account with parama ages ago, when i was still in diapers.
The staff was very nice and professional.
This bank is pretty quiet inside.
I love that the service was quick and there was not a line
Thanks and good luck!
I am a huge fan of desert schools.
They are really nice and great to bank with.
I recommended everyone switch to a credit union especially this one!
The lines are never super long, even on friday afternoon.
I have never had a major problem like i experienced at other banks.
The other major bonus is they have branches inside wallmarts open all day saturdays.
I am new to the area.
Pawn 1st has a very professional staff and a clean pawn shop.
I have bought sold and pawned many things for many years from pawn stores up and down the west coast.
I have been nothing but pleased with my purchases and the customer service i received at this location.
Brandyn he's been amazing.
He worked with my wife.
And myself and i plan on continuing my business with pawn 1st and brandyn for many years to come.
I went in to open a new checking account and got so much more !
My checking account also included a savings account.
Then to make it even better i also opened what we old school people call a christmas club.
I was so amazed at everything that is available to me.
The on line banking is amazing too.
The customs service is above and beyond ...... marco wibowo was so awesome !!!
He made me so comfortable and made sure i knew everything about my account and the benefits .
I am so excited and happy with my decision to open my account with marco at one nevada .
I look forward to many years of service with my personal banker marco wibowo !
Thank you marco !
Hands down the best insurance agent and office!!
The employees are so helpful and friendly.
I've had several claims/accidents and they've always taken great care of me.
I needed to buy some chinese yuan (renminbi) for my trip to shanghai.
It was a wonderful sign that i saw the cibc penguin.
I love penguins, so i was bound to spot it.
Moments later, there was this cibc.
I didn't have to wait long.
There was one gentleman ahead of me.
The exchange rate was decent.
I didn't get dinged at all!
It helped that i had a chequing account.
The woman was friendly and helpful.
I got my money and was a happy camper.
Brian has been fantastic over the last 2 years on our account.
He always finds us resolution to a problem, even on weekends when he is home with his family.
The support staff are also very helpful if anything goes wrong with the equipment.
They gave me credit when no one else would.
They were professional, courteous, and respectful of my wishes.
That's on you to do, so if you fail at this it's your fault not theirs.
Thanks credit one bank, i truly appreciate you giving me credit a while back when no one else would!
You served me well while i had you.
I worked with unison bank for a home loan.
Dave did a great job always available and they were the cheapest.
I have been banking with dsfcu since 2000, and i can honestly say that i love my bank!
I had a good experience with donna e, new accounts.
Very efficient and kept process understandable, simple and fast.
Also explained differences between credit unions & banks.
Thumbs up for the help.
I have been a customer there for about 10 years.
She said we could call any time and we did.
With her advice we got a great deal and saved us a lot of money.
I just purchased my first home and john did an outstanding job on our loan.
He made the experience so much easier than i thought it would be!
I highly recommend john to help get your loan!
This bank is close to home its quick and easy access is fun and i like it.
But over all i give it 4 stars.
Its a nice place to save your money and watch it grow.
Claudia gave me the best service i could have asked for.
She is so friendly and very professional that it seems like i've known her for years.
Claudia you are amazing thank you for your outstanding customer service you provided to me.
I was very happy and couldn't ask for anything more.
Keep up the good work and hope to see you soon!
Claudia is the best!!
Erica has provided me with information that has definitely been of help to me and my family.
Erik was awsome, very knowledgeable.
Everyone is so fantastic here!!
They are eager to help and knowledgable with any question/situation our family has ever had.
Great customer service and perfect location for us.
Parama is the best kept secret in banking in toronto!!
It's a small, community based credit union, and of course you have a say in how it's run.
And also you get returned a share of the profits!
In 2013, they returned something like $250,000 to their members.
-free regular cheques -free pretty much everything else!
Potential barriers:   -both branches are in etobicoke along the bloor subway line.
I live in vancouver now, though, and that hasn't really stopped me from enjoying their services.
-you have to buy a $40 share to join.
But you would get the money back if you wanted to leave.
I recently switched from bank of america.
I didn't know banking could be this easy and no fees!
I dealt with rick guillette who is the nicest guy in the world.
He was very honest and informative.
He made me feel very comfortable and even showed me how make 2% on my checking account.
I also worked with cassie higgins who remembers my name every time i go in there.
The way you always imagined your bank should treat you.
Ahh, bmo makes my life so much easier.
The downtown location is conveniently located across from the train station (which will open again soon!)
And the tellers and service people are all incredibly nice.
Still, i've had nothing but good experiences with the central location.
John worked hard to give us our refinance in a timely manner.
He went over all the options and rates we qualified for, and was definitely knowledgeable and well spoken.
The transaction went smoothly, and i would definitely recommend him to my friends and neighbors!
Dennae was absolutely amazing!
So polite, friendly, and courteous- i think she may be my favorite teller ever, at any bank!
My transaction was quick, efficient, and taken care of with a smile.
The bank/credit union was clean and there was no wait when i arrived.
If you ever have occasion to work with dennae, you are in for a treat!
I did speak to the director?
I think she was and we came to an agreement and things worked out better than i had hoped.
Thank you for that.
She navigates deposits, it issues and anything else i've needed.
Fantastic job to this location and their staff.
Josh is very kind and knowledgeable.
He goes above and beyond the call of duty to help you with anything you need.
I highly recommend him for any and all of your insurance needs.
Found exactly what we were looking for at a great price.
Customer service was also excellent.
Agent was extremely knowledgeable and helpful , helped me with all my insurance questions .
Would recommend this place great customer service !
I highly recommend erik fieldman and his team.
I will definitely recommend erik and his team to my friends and family.
Absolutely like no other cu!!
She will definitely take care of all your needs!
(including any financing needs!)
I've been with them for years.
I am always very pleased!
Note: this review pertains to the facilities at the pines in urbana and the main bank on university ave.
I am astonished at all the negative reviews for busey bank.
All my banking is done there.
I have been steered right in all my business -- refinancing, ira, loans, whatever.
In the decades of business with busey, i have never been treated with anything but professionalism and courtesy.
Online banking intimidated me but busey's online banking has been easy to use.
Good fast friendly service, nice employees
I switched to df from wells fargo after they pulled a shady switcheroo on my mortgage.
I have been very happy so far with desert financial!
Most recently, i had to cash in quite a few savings bonds.
My teller kali, was knowledgeable, patient, and funny too!
I totally get the hype of switching from a big bank to a credit union!
This is a bank, what could i write about it?
Actually some good things.
I frequently do my banking here.
It is near my home, work, and the businesses in pebble marketplace that i use.
The customer service here is fine.
Usually, there is an employee standing near the entrance that will ask me what i am here for.
Usually it is my typical banking and i progress to the cue leading to the tellers.
The line generally moves at a decent pace.
Recently, i was impressed with how katy handled my credit card problem.
Katy was personable and took the initiative to contact their credit card division right there.
And right in the bank that problem was taken care of.
And, customer service is another reason that i often bank here.
I like this banking center!
When i do go inside there is usually enough staff on hand for little to no wait!
The staff is informative and always helpful!
Came up here to set up a new account.
And was immediately greeted by carlos who helped me out and got me set up extremely quick.
Clean good coffee and friendly service i'll be back.
The whole thing took about a half hour
A great bank and home lender to work with.
My broker was dave barca.
We did an fha refinance and it was all done over the phone.
Dave was beyond knowledgeable and efficient in handling my loan.
Everything he said happened just the way he said it would.
So i am very pleased with him and his company.
So i highly recommend.
I only use uw credit union for checking so i can't comment on their other services.
They cashed a savings bond for me that another credit union wouldn't.
The atmosphere is casual and everyone is super friendly.
If i've ever had a problem they were there to help me solve it immediately.
I have been a customer with one nevada for several years and i have had some good and bad experiences.
I have worked in customer service most of my life and a little kindness and understanding goes a long way!
Please continue to offer this level of service because it will keep customers banking with this bank.
I ended my day in the bank and was not looking forward to having to go, but rebecca changed that!!!
I look forward to her staying at this branch and am hoping that she does.
This is your average chase bank.
This was my first time in a wf in a very long time.
I brought my grandmother.
It was very nice to see someone greeting customers and directing them to the appropriate area.
My grandmother is handicapped and they got her seated at a window quickly where someone helped her quite quickly.
Thank you for taking care of the elderly the way my grandmother was cared for today.
We have been loyal customers of this bank for nearly 5 years .
They are a terrific group of people working closely together to ensure the customer has a great experience .
My husband shannon took out a title loan and didn't know the process.
Adrianna was awesome, she answered all his questions and made the process seamless.
Helped us buy our first house and i got a free, logo stress ball!!!
And of course, there's the way cool orange colours with the white lion.
Yep, that's ing, the mostly online bank.
But that's the key phrase... mostly.
You see, they actually have some branches and atm machines.
But it really can't be called a branch in the traditional sense.
It's much more like a cafe, in form and function with plenty of open space.
In fact, they call themselves the orange cafe, and come complete with access to coffee (in neato orange coffee mugs).
Follow them at @orangeyyc for their regular social events and check out a bank branch that's not a bank branch.
#14 of yelp's 30-day review challenge
I've used chase, i've used wamu, i've used bofa.
They are all terrible.
I started using unison about 7 years ago for my business and never looked back.
Within a month of opening my account they'd greet me by name when i walk in.
Do they have a photo of me?
Now i have kids accounts and a loan through them.
Staff is very personable and friendly.
The new branch is amazing too.
I recently discovered that you can walk into a place called a bank and walk out with something called "cash".
This is a life changing event for me.
My experience s a teller experience.
This branch is located in the fry's grocery store.
It is a small branch that offers tellers and personal banking experience.
I was immediately greeted and serviced with a smile.
I was thanked for my business when i walked out the door.
I have been a customer of the clark county credit union for nearly 13 years.
They have always been there when i needed a car loan, signature loan or if i just had questions.
I mostly use the tenaya branch and have dealt with christine tassone numerous times.
She is extremely professional and pleasant to work with.
Response time is extremely quick.
They even found a buyer for my husbands truck, when we wanted to sell it and not trade it in.
I came to the tangerine cafe to open a new bank account.
I work near so it was easy to drop by at lunch time.
There are employees to help you through it, but the sign up is mainly through an ipad.
It was quick and easy which is nice.
You can even scan your id on it too!
A tad hassly, but it's free.
I visit this branch frequently and have always been treated with respect.
It is a busy branch but then all bank of america offices in the supermarkets are extremely busy!
I've noticed lately that service has improved and attribute it to great teamwork the team is now displaying.
Keep up the great work, your efforts are not going unnoticed!
We saved over two hundred a month and three months with no payment right before xmas.
She is sweet and was patient with all dumb questions i asked.
Lots of tellers, short lines, and knowledgable staff.
This is a great main branch bank!
I almost pooped my pants this was such a good time.
Everything you could expect from a bank, nice people taking your money and holding onto it for you.
The atm is in a good location with a nice interface, drive thru people are nice.
This wells fargo is in a pretty convient location right off i-10.
Quick easy transactions, and if you go thru the drive thru with a kid they will give you a sucker.
Would be 5star if they just gave me free money.
One of the most friendly banks, staff rocks, debbie, dawn are great personnel unlikely other banks.
This agent has been fantastic from day one.
Very professional and the staffing team is phenomenal.
I'm thankful for everything you've done chuck.
My mom & i have been banking with cccu for years and we do not have any complaints.
We especially love the bank teller at the tenaya branch named jodie.
Keep up the good work  jodie!
The drive-thru clerks here are awesome!
They're fast, courtesy, and pleasant to do business with.
They engage right off the bat.
Most lanes (3 including 1 atm lane) are open.
It takes me no more than 5min to drive through and make a brisk deposit.
A few min more if no lanes are open.
They have a pen inside the capsule thing for you if you need it.
I do not want to wait to be greeted by those lovely tellers!!
I want those clerks to make my day right away, and not idling behind you.
So, please, get your life together and come correct.
Then take your receipt, lollipop, and reminiscence how pleasant that event was.
*tip*  ask for a stack of deposit slip and place them in an envelope inside your car.
That way the world (me) doesn't have to wait.
*side note*  don't worry if you have doctor's handwriting or sketch in klingon.
They'll decode that sh*t and make sure your money goes into the right account.
Just make sure you use my account number xxxxxxx1234 -;d
The staff here are very friendly and helpful, and always do their best within the rules of us bank.
There are onerous kyc rules these days which are very irritating.
They should allow counter staff to process sending wires to streamline processes.
Really helpful when i was a first-time insurance buyer after graduating college.
Answered all my questions-would definitely recommend to a friend!
I'm totally satisfied with the bank but sure had a few problems but always got them worked out.
This bank has help my credit to go to 750 score.
Had them over 8 years after a bankruptcy and lost my house..
It's nice because you can see your credit score every month!
Mh neighbor referred me to unison bank for my fha streamline.
David and his team did a wonderful job finding the most inexpensive financing possible and providing great customer service.
David was available anytime i had questions, and there were times i contacted called after hours and weekends.
He responded with answers and information needed, it was great!
Started banking at washington mural back in the day.
Eventually they switched over to chase when they were bought out.
Been with them since.
This location is clean and friendly.
The drive thru services are nice and don't take long.
Been coming here for years.
Conveniently located by harkins and walmart.
I came in today to close an account.
Even though today was my last day as their customer, the staff was very kind and accommodating with me.
They still treated me as a valued customer and treated me with respect and care.
I appreciate that they still tried to go out of their way to make me feel like they cared.
I believe the main lady that assisted me was the branch manager and one of the tellers.
Thank you for your excellent customer service today!
This chase is awesome!
It's in boca park and it's usually pretty empty and the staff are super attentive and helpful.
Def check it out if you're in a rush and you want to get in and out!
We finally have atm's that post cash immediately!
Bravo for moving up to current technology!
For loans ssscu is a very good bank.
Gave us a great interest rate on a home loan!!
Always a  pleasure banking here.
Even if i have to wait a few minutes the staff is always very helpful.
I've been a member since 17 and i am very pleased.
Top notch customer service.
I was in last week an opened a new account.
The representative that assisted shea was knowledgeable and made the account opening process smooth and quick.
The branch is conveniently located and beautifully designed.
From the moment i walked in, i was greeted warmly.
I feel very secure in knowing my money will be handled correctly.
Update from a year ago...i posted 5 stars.
A year later, still 5 stars.
Again, stop blaming others...you are to blame.
You, you, only you.
That means you are living above your means, or limit, and should not have any cards at all.
That's what got you to a high risk card to begin with.
I make 1-3 purchases on this card every month, and pay it in full.
Credit one reports faithfully to the credit bureaus, and your score will go up.
Just be...oh...responsible...and you will be fine.
So i called to check.
I have been with b of a for roughly 15 years!
I have a credit card with them a savings and checking account.
I love being able to quickly & easily pay all my bills online.
I set them up and never have to worry about it again.
Their customer service it not that great!
It's very hard to talk to a real person.
Some area's the customer service is good (in house) but some area's of town, it's shotty...
This is an easy bank which is what i like the most about them.
Anyways, on with the review already...i love desert schools.
I don't see myself ever switching to another bank for any purpose.
I have been banking with them for 4 years and have never had even one issue.
In fact, they often resolve issues for me, such as removing those nasty little nsf fees.
I also never have to wait in much of a line.
I also feel as if they don't pressure you to open other services.
If anyone talks about bank issues, i always find myself raving about my wonderful banking experiences!!!
Thank you desert schools for being awesome!
From the employees, to the service and fraud department, they've always been top notch.
Superb people and service!
The drive through is usually fast but the employees came sometimes take too much time for one little thing.
It's somewhat easy to find though if you've never been here before.
Jonathan chao will work hard to earn your business and take care of you.
He will find a solution to fit your needs, whether high volume or low.
If you are shopping for a merchant processor, he is at the very least worth a call.
There i met pat johnson.
I have never had a home loan go so smoothly and quickly.
The one bump we had pat was on it.
Being more than satisfied with how my home loan went i tried a car loan.
To know surprise it went smoothly and quickly, 30 minutes tops.
To matt (car broker) and jennifer "the new yorker"(car loan rep)thank you for an excellent and painless experience.
Customer service is pretty good.
It's like a checkout line that has no "express - fewer than 10 items" option.
It's a serious flaw if you're making deposits most days.
Came in to the branch today to inquire about setting up an account and applying for an auto loan.
Alex s set up my account and answered all of my questions.
Alex even took the time to explain some credit building options.
This is a great branch and i will definitely recommend my friends and family here!
Recently opened an account with az fed cu after banking with comerica bank for years.
Decided that feeding the "banksters" on wall street with my cash was no longer a good idea.
I can highly recommend as everything has gone smoothly with the transition from "banksters" to local credit union.
I was shopping for auto loans and wanted a specific rate.
My own chase bank couldn't even get close with a pretty good credit score and income.
Checked several other banks and credit unions before making it to cccu.
I was put in touch with ky adeseye from the n tenaya/smoke ranch location, and he made it happen.
Ky was on it from the jump.
Approved with the best percentage rate i'd seen yet.
That was so important on a model that moves so quickly when they hit the market.
Very thankful for his help and everyone else involved.
I felt like the time was wasted.
Erik and his team made the mortgage process understandable and efficient.
Rates were super competitive as well.
I highly recommend and will use in future.
Our family has been with chuck kelly's state farm for 17 years when he first took over the business.
We quickly learned how customer service is an important factor in the way he runs this business.
We have also referred a few friends to chuck's office and they could not be more happy with his service.
In general we have been very happy with the service of state farm in general.
I would highly recommend state farm for your insurance needs.
Always great customer service.
My husband and i share an account and the wonderful tellers always know who we are.
Even at busy times they are very friendly and efficient.
This is a great local credit union.
I am a new customer at cccu lv and i go to the tenaya branch because sharwani is there.
She has been tremendous in helping me get my business account started.
Working with a smaller bank, you feel like you know everyone.
It has been a great experience for me and i thank sharwani for her constant help in getting me going.
I recommend this bank to anyone in las vegas and extremely recommend doing your business at the tenaya branch.
Just ask for sharwani and she will take care of you.
The branch has wonderful employees who are always nice, helpful and seem honestly caring about your bank needs.
Sometimes there are many more peoples then staff to assist them.
The only reason this was not a 5 star rating is because the parking lot is a safety hazard.
If it's not pot holes it's a crack that has caused the asphalt to rise.
The atm's need to be updated also but that is just an aside not a major problem.
Go see lan the manager!
Great location and customer service    chase has a lot of technologically advanced options for its customers.
Well worth the move, especially if your coming from wells fargo haha
I recently added my daughter to my insurance to help her out.
Nery was phenomenal in assisting me.
I used to only deal with olga and since her retirement, i didn't feel very confident with anyone else.
When i connected with nery, i was very happy with her attention to my needs and wanting to help.
I felt i was a valued customer with her.
These people are very kind.
I was struggling this month and they went above and beyond to help me.
They are family owned and really try to work with you ...
The staff here are very nice and helpful!
It's never that busy or crowded when i go and it's in a great location!
I am new to one nevada so i didn't know what to expect.
But i was contacted the next day and everything was made right!
I will update my rating later after i have built a relationship with them.
Thanks again for fixing the problem promptly!
So, i've lived in tempe all my life, needless to say, tscu has been there for the majority of it.
They have only gotten better since my first savings account started there, back when i was a wee lad.
They were super helpful and laid everything out for me in easy terms.
Now i'm happy owner of a nice little condo.
This bank is super awesome, they've always been friendly every time i've been in there.
They have 3 drive-thru tellers, so you won't waste any gas sitting and waiting to get helped.
I love chase bank, why?
Because of multiple banks for easy access and fast atm speed.
Yesterday i can by here after 4pm and they were a bit busy.
(sigh) so i left.
Came back today at 11:10 and there was hardly a line.
Thy offers me a bottle of water and my son found a coloring table.
Top it off with free money orders and now, they get a 5-star review!
I was staying at the hilton next door and got access to the ymca.
One of the days, i woke up with a sore throat.
Headed to the gym anyways, but started coughing horribly just as i checked in.
Had to walk out to clear my throat then went back in and hopped on an elliptical machine.
The lady at the front desk was so nice!
She brought me a cup of water because she noticed that i was coughing so much earlier.
Now i wish i belonged to a ymca back home.
Going to have to look into it for sure.
Steve and his team have been my "go-to" insurance people since i relocated to arizona 20 years ago.
I brought probably 3+ boyfriends to his agency who still all hold insurance through him.
My sister and her entire family, and now my husband...
Thanks for all the great years!
I've been doing business with cccu for years, service is great!
The asian lady who helped me at this branch was so kind and helpful.
This great experience saved me as a chase customer.
I don't really enjoy going to the bank but i've had to do it a lot recently for work.
Unfortunately,  while i was out of town there were a few banking issues that i noticed when i returned.
I went to this branch and tatiana went above and beyond to help me resolve these issues.
Tatiana called me back a few hours later with all the answers!
She was able to resolve these issues the same day and help me to get everything situated quickly and easily.
I highly recommend this branch!
You thought i let the people who are in charge know.
This branch provides excellent service in a friendly, relaxed atmosphere.
Quite a different banking experience than the impersonal mega-banks where employees change and managers get relocated frequently.
Chad bernal was phenominal in helping me set up a new account today.
The whole staff has a good vibe.
I recommend this branch and chads services to anyone looking for a quality hometown feeling.
Staff is extremely friendly here and they are always so quick!
I rarely have to wait in line when i walk in the door.
The parking is the only down side.
It's a small parking lot, so parking is usually  full and parking feels crammed.
Aside from the parking i've never had a problem with the branch.
This is a busy bofa location.
The teller who helped me with both my personal and business needs was friendly.
She also thanked me for coming in.
Good location and nice staff.
I enjoyed doing my banking over here.
Brittany was very friendly and helpful.
Will come back often.
Yelp 100 challenge - 2018 # 66  thank you denise for the amazing customer service and great conversation.
I love wells fargo and haven't had a problem with them.
I love their online portal because you can literally handle everything.
I love that they allow you to personalize your debit card online and as often as you want.
This location had three atm's available.
Two through the drive through and one by the entrance.
Customer service:  it depends on who you get when you walk in but on today i had amazing customer service.
I'm to have had such a knowledgeable banker.
Always the best service.
Been coming here forever and top notch crew.
Keep it up and keep your employees happy.
The people who work here and super friendly and helpful; they are the reason for the high rating!
Always friendly, no long wait times.
Used this bank in minnesota and never had a problem.
They need 10 days notice to get more than 2k.
Never heard of that before.
Since relocating to mesa a year ago, i chose linda's office to handle my auto insurance for my business.
I am confident that as my business grows, i can trust linda and her office to have me covered.
Any time i have requested a meeting to discuss my policy, it has been an easy process.
Renee is so amazing.
She made the process so fast and fun.
She was knowledgeable, and a joy to interact with.
If you are ever in need to financial services or just to open an account.
Just ask for her.
I can't rave enough about her customer service.
Making a deposit, for my mom.
What a great bank.
The tellers are cheerful and i love the ornate pictures that are hung along the walls.
Dollar banks are always decorated so very regal.
I do not bank here but have to come here to pay my rent each month.
If i ever want to change banks i just may have to give them a try.
Thank u for each of you at fifth 3rd bank.
I thank u for all you each do to make such an amazing experience each time i come in!!
May god continue to bless each of u and all your families always.
They always go above and beyond.
Excellent service and employees that care.
Banker alen g. showed genuine concern and took the time out of his day to assist with my banking needs.
I recommend going to the branch to solve issues.
Especially if they do business like they do here.
There's even a nice open sitting area by the entrance.
This was actually one of the first banks of america i ever visited.
Back then, i think it was nationsbank.
Yes, it was that long ago.
It was a long time ago, and they were one of the few who would do it for free.
And me, not even a customer.
Extremely friendly and efficient.
I've been banking with wf for 21 years and this is by far the best location i've been to.
I only use this branch's drive-thru atm.
Good and fast, very bright area during night time hours.
Near sr-51 and loop-101 in the northeast phoenix neighborhood.
That's what makes a great business model; no matter what the product or service is that they are selling.
I'd previously banked at a 1st bank in colorado.
The service was outstanding.
I've now been to two separate branch locations of first bank in the phoenix area.
This scottsdale branch is outstanding; but so is the other branch i've stopped in.
Both of them have the same outstanding customer "friendly" service.
Whomever is in charge of the corporate customer service policy, thank you!
The friendly service at first bank blows every other bank out of the water.
Thankfully, linda has removed my need to continue doing the annual "shopping for the best deal on insurance" task.
I recently met with her for an ifr (insurance and financial review) and was thoroughly impressed with the experience.
Linda literally took a page of notes throughout the meeting on action items which required follow-up or additional information.
Another huge a++ for this awesome commitment to take care of her customers).
Highly recommended for something as important as insurance and finances are.
This is a stand alone chase branch located at the southeast corner of silverado ranch blvd.
The building is obviously pretty new and immaculate, inside and out.
I have been here several times recently and there is never a line!
Maybe i've just been really lucky, who knows?
I always get a smile, a warm greeting, and am asked how my day is going.
It may seem a bit insignificant, but it actually makes me enjoy coming to this location.
I honestly can't think of one valid reason to knock a star off of their rating....so...i'm going with..  5 stars!
Love the staff, the equipment, and the facility.
Always enjoy working out there - but try to hit the nonpeak times.
They are a giant bank however, and the staff doesn't have any leeway for bending the rules.
Specifically with two incredible bankers wanda and seema!
We spoke on the way to the bank and bang!
By the time i arrived all the ppw was ready to sign.
I can't say enough about this amazing service i just experienced!
I am a raving fan!
I have never had a problem with wells fargo, either in person or by support via phone.
The employees have always been understanding of my concerns and addressed them quickly with a polite and professional demeanor.
Of course this has only happened twice in 8 years.
You give them your hard earned money.
They hold onto it for you.
If all goes well, it'll still be there for you when you need it for stuff.
I have been a member of summit credit union for almost 30 years.
They have always went above and beyond to assist me and my husband with whatever need we have had.
I would never consider switching financial institutions.
We primarily use the credit union on e wilson street; however, we have also used numerous other branches.
The staff has always been helpful, professional and friendly.
I highly recommend this credit union.
I have been a member for over two years now.
Getting it was quick & easy and the lady was nice & helpful.
He was able to help me consolidate my credit card debt and was a pleasure to work with.
I would highly recommend mountain america and jared to anyone looking for a great place to bank with!
I never have to wait long for anything, they exchange bills without a fuss, & they have great hours!
I don't use chase personally, although they kinda make me want to!
I use them with work.
The staff at this location are extremely friendly and fast!
Much quicker than the location a few blocks away.
Thank you guys for putting up with my super specific banking needs!
I go here regularly as the hours are great, and the customer service is top notch.
Evening hours and saturday hours and because of the staff here i won't go anywhere else.
This branch is very well located and not far from the 101 freeway.
Since the shopping center is relatively new, the building is up to date as well.
Parking is not a hassle at all.
In fact, you can park halfway between the harkins and the us bank and save gas.
If you have been to some other banks with grumpy tellers this place will be refreshing.
Yes, i know that they are supposed to be upbeat but they genuinely seem to enjoy their jobs.
Primarily use their atm services but indoor service has been pleasant and helpful.
They are required of course to try to sell their products but i tire of that sometimes.
The atm is well lit and convenient but difficulty accepting cash at times and that frustrates me.
Otherwise, i like this bank and their on-line services.
*fyi: if you're interested in the group yoga classes, go to the front desk first and get a pass.
The actual yoga room is down the last elevator bank and through the glass doors.
You need a pass to get through security.
Why not review my local wells fargo bank?
Let's see, what can i say, i've only been inside and actually interacted with a human twice.
The tellers were friendly enough and there was a younger guy directing people who had questions on where to go.
When i visit this branch, i'm usually coming to use the drive-thru atm.
It's quick, efficient, and never crowded.
Until next time, wells fargo.
Yelp 100 challenge 2015: #193
Except for some of their fees that they didnt tell me about i liked my experience with them.
Im waiting to open a new bank account.
They have great friendly staff.
Location is the the key on a great bank.
Amazing bank for small business.
Seth is an outstanding bank representative of the bank.
Looking forward to our business future partly because of alerus!
I recently opened up a bank account for our school ptsa with this branch.
We were assigned someone to work with.
The personal banker's name was sabrina petit.
Very professional and helpful throughout the entire process.
She called and sure enough bri said that she could come back!
They offered our ptsa no fee checking, which included free checks!
If you've ever tried to open a business account anywhere else, you'd know that this is a big deal.
The bank was out of money bags the day that i set up the account.
Bri said that she would set one aside for me when they came in.
Bri is always pleasant, patient, and helpful.
I would recommend that people ask for bri - she was great.
So great in fact that we are thinking about going to open savings accounts for our kids there with her!
Oh and hey, you can't beat the popcorn machine, water bottles, cookies and sometimes lollipops that are in the lobby!
Chase is the best bank in las vegas.
I love people that works for chase .
So friendly and helpful.
Thanks chase for making my life easier :)
Outstanding customer service, better than any bank i have ever belonged to!
The tellers are professional and happy to help fill out the deposit slip for you.
Oh and they will give you a bottled water while you wait.
This bank is on the smaller side and i believe there are only a few locations in town.
Bright entrance for in-door atm.
Will need to use your chase debit card to gain entry.
Fast machine, one lane of drive-thru atm as well.
Fernando is an understanding banker at this location that listens and works with and for you.
Online banking at ds is still in last century with glitches that he helped explain.
How takes the time to  get what you want and at a great quote.
I've recommended friends to this office without hesitation.
Great customer service hands down and always professional!
This just might be my new lunch time routine.
Its close to work and they offer a cardio strength class around lunch time.
Only thing is that its packed at noon.
So i went at 12:45 and by the time i was done, it was a ghost town.
So i can go at 1:00 and get in and out within an hour.
Even with taking a shower!
I had some fraudulent activity on my debit card that messed up everything up generating overdraft fees.
Everyone knows it could be a stressful situation.
I appreciate all your help
The most efficient and kind office staff!
You guys are awesome and i'll never forget how awesome i was treated.
Thank you, thank you, thank you!
They were attentive and easy to work with!
We opened our business accounts here.
We have always received extremely helpful service.
It's a full service location with the fancy atms inside which disperse $1, $5 & $20 bills.
Friendly tellers and a terrific biz banker.
Sometimes, i just don't want to give my cash/check to a machine.
Although we could go to any location, i prefer doing business with this one.
Rush hour traffic makes access/exiting more challenging, but not impossible.
Logan was our representative at this location for changing over our insurance from aaa.
He was extremely helpful and informative about our options for car and home insurance.
He listed options and made recommendations to what seemed best fit and logical.
If you need any assistance, i would highly recommend this office.
All representatives are very welcoming and try to get the best deal for their clients.
It is such a blessing to be able to get in a workout on my lunch break.
She's a great teacher.
My only complaint is that they charge $10 per guest.
If i want to bring someone that is visiting me from out of town or something, it's very inconvenient.
Other than that, a+!
I loved the facilities then and they've even recently updated everything (march 2014).
Looks like they moved around some staff offices and gave members more workout space.
We were recently out here for a wedding.
My husband packed his suit, but forgot to pack a dress shirt.
Since he discovered this an hour before the wedding, he started to panic.
We knew there was a kohls about 5 mins away, and he wanted to go there.
Of course, she pulled exactly the shirt he needed, and then offered to press it for him!
We made it to the wedding with about 5 min to spare.
Chanel and her co- worker saved the day for us!
Thank you jab for fantastic customer service!
Knowledgeable service and gets you in and out quickly!
He talked me into trying and a lady named stacey helped me big time!!
Turns out i could qualify and she also gave me advice for other financial troubles.
Im happy they talked me into it.
I recommend her if your wanting an acct .
It only took 10 minutes to open too!
She helped me and answered all my questions !
So sweet and considerate !
Walked in this morning to find one of my old banker, managing.
Mr. mike h.  got to see him in action.
How expedient, and efficient mike is.
I have friends that have known him all his life.
What a great asset mike h.,  is to bank of america.
Daniel is no chop liver.
The kid is good too.
You can find it at the corner of water st. and basic rd.
In the same plaza as nevada state college.
This is a really modern bank.
They are a pleasure to work with.
They are very organized and knowledgeable.
I worked with jared when i was there and i have all good things to say about him.
This place is great all the staff are friendly and helpful they give me the loan i needed.
This place is great and highly recommended.
Convenient location with a 24/7 atm.
I always get attentive care and they remember my name!
They are always friendly and willing to help me with any issues i have.
No, i'm not a vet.
My dad is a usmc retiree, and this is how i got my ticket in.
I've banked with other financial institutions and none can top it.
It was rather rough banking in a state that never had a single nfcu branch.
So once they opened this branch as the first branch in las vegas, and it being so close to home...score!
Most especially when you'd like to reverse out of your stall.
The drivers driving through therr can be so unconscious or just a dickass.
I always hope there's an open stall at the side of the building between chevron and nfcu on such days.
Other than that, the staff are fairly professional.
I've never experienced a genuine negative one with any of the member reps.
These days i've noticed there is now a cnlv police officer upon entering.
Not sure where that ensued from, but i supposed it is comforting to many.
Opened an account today.
From the security outside to the teller and bank representatives, my visit was easy, quick and reassuring.
A+ chandler blvd location!
I went in and was treated with respect and smiles and the deal went smooth.
They helped me with a fine loan as i had just flew back from europe and was short of cash.
This business made my first month back in america very nice.
I am thankful for this business.
I have been to this location several times and each experience has been pleasant.
The most recent experience at the drive thru was the one to make me want to write the review.
I was very impressed by the drive thru service.
Banks are banks (just like cell phone companies).
Most products and services and fees are almost interchangeable, you have to find the one that fits your needs.
Working within federal guidelines and having to stay competitive, keeps them all fairly similar.
To me, this was a great example as to why i like to bank with wells fargo.
Longtime customer before chase was wamu.
Have 3 open accounts and 2 credit cards with chase.
Went into this branch today to open a 4th account.
Was helped by taylor, who was simply awesome.
Cordial and friendly, definitely keen on service.
I'm always assisted graciously here at this branch every time i walk in.
They also have drive thru service which is convenient.
Walk up atm is also a plus.
I recommend this particular branch due to their professionalism and courteous ways.
The staff have been very pleasant each time.
Sometimes there is a line up and it feels like it's taking forever!
Lines are always quick.
Atm machines except cash and checks for deposit with images optional.
The tellers are very friendly and professional.
Thank you for making this feel like home!
I wasn't very impressed with this bank.
They will charge you fees if you don't have enough money in your checking account doesn't meet certain min.
So the business bank accounts are not technically free.
The upside is that this bank is very good at financing its customers with line of credits.
They have probably the best unsecured line of credit programs in the city.
The reason is because they have all the money!
This is a great branch.
I have always been treated with respect here.
The customer service is excellent.
These guys could give customer service lessons to the downtown branch.
Ulises helped me today, but as i said, everyone here is awesome!
Because it is the only navy fed in vegas, the staff should be cool and friendly.
With my experiences at this single lv branch, theyre great!
Really nice people and clean, slick looking bank.
Making the switch from chase wasn't as easy as we promised, but they did try to make up for it.
Customer service at this location is outstanding!
The branch manager and his staff are true professionals.
Great bank  staff is all ways there to help.
All ways  with a smile  glad i use first merit
Love this credit union.
I have had an account here for more than 20 years.
I have both a personal and business account here.
I highly recommend this credit union and i've used the tempe branch exclusively for 12+ years, including my business acct.
Extremely helpful staff and very professional as well.
So caring and helpful as well as the branch manager frank.
He checked on me a few times.
Great staff and branch!
My bank was bought out by alerus.
I was nervous at first, but decided to give them a chance.
The "no foreign transaction fee" was awesome!!!
I hate going inside of the bank, when possible i always use the drive thur.
I worked with jacob d. i gotta say he really changed my mind about my anxiety with bankers.
He was really helpful and really took the time to explain to me on what's going with my bank account.
I felt like he went beyond what my expectations were.
I left really happy and relaxed knowing everything was taken of care.
So if you're headed to the location on 48th and ray rd.
Ask for jacob d.!!!
As mos t banks, avoid during payday fridays during lunch and around rush hour or you will be stuck !
I have been a client for two years and appreciate the great personal service they offer all their clients.
Aaron jumps hoops for small businesses and alisha makes the day a little brighter.
Kudos to chris, tony and marlene who showed them how to work as a team.
My favorite bank in over 35 years of banking in arizona.
I was surprised that this bank had not been reviewed yet.
I've always had good experiences here.
I'm super happy with the investments, and all of the tellers are always super nice, friendly, and helpful.
Steve sears is absolutely the best !
He is friendly, knowledgeable, honest and professional.
I have never felt pressure to buy insurance i didn't need/want and feel they have always given me options.
There was no pressure.
A five minute phone call saved me 1 1/2%.
I highly, highly, highly recommend steve sears state farm.
I feel like i am always treated like family!
Thanks steve and mary jean!!
Yanira assisted me for a loan had great attitude, funny and easy going.
Great to feel comfortable and have a good interaction!
I just moved here and needed a new bank account.
My representative, who is the relationship manager, lee helped me out.
He was really nice and helpful and the process was seamless.
I got a new account right away!
Lee also helped me set up my debit card and deposit as well.
My experience was definitely a 5 star service.
If i could leave 10 starts i would of!
I've been a member for over two years and i have nothing but good things to say about sun west.
Everyone is always very helpful and courteous.
I refinanced my high interest car loan here and was pleasantly surprised at how low the interest rate was.
You can't beat the no fee checking.
I recommend this credit union to all my friends.
Never thought to review a bank until receiving such stellar service!
Pretty good ymca, but much smaller than many around the country.
There's plenty of cardio machines, so weights are the only things that require some waiting.
Used to bank with az federal cu, but no longer.
I now do all my banking with oneaz!
The branch on rural and southern is the best.
Great service and i love the smell, the energy and the layout!
Customer service is very good and very attentive!
Good customer service goes a long way.
I showed up at 2:05 on saturday and they closed at 2:00.
They didn't have to let me in and unlock the door so i can do my transaction but they did.
These folks are friendly.
The bank is clean.
Security officer is friendly.
Atms are conveniently located.
So happy that they are also near my new home.
The tellers always know what i need before i realize i need it.
Not to mention, they're friendly and energizing!
This is a credit union that has truly stayed true to their roots, even though they've become much larger.
Walked in had a small wait.
Was able to open an account quickly and with amazing customer service.
Was looking for a good pair of cedar shoe trees.
After calling around to a dozen places, i finally found them here.
Yes that wasn't a typo, i spent 25 bucks and got 3 shoe trees.
Store was very clean.
But while looking at the clothes i noticed that they seemed to be for the 40-65yr old man.
Pcg is a wonderful factoring company.
You will never hear "that's not my department or talk to so and so".
Pcg can even help with equipment loans and fuel.
If your company is considering factoring, stop looking now!!
I enjoy going to this wells fargo.
I visit this one often.
They have good service.
This wells fargo branch also has its own drive-thru atm.
You can also cash checks through the drive-thru.
Unfortunately, you cannot cash anything from the drive-thru atm with checks larger then $300, so don't waste your time.
Fast service and the building was cleaned and organized.
But deer valley credit union changed that for me.
Referred to me by a co-worker, i joined dvcu back in 2014 with just a simple checking and savings account.
Now i also have my home and both both vehicles all through dvcu.
Great rates, and always the friendliest staff.
This is definitely a personable branch.
They are always prompt either at the teller or to, if needed, sit down with me in an office.
While i often avoid talking to strangers, there don't seem to be any strangers at this location.
Other banks could take some lessons from this team!
This location is the closest one to unlv.
I work and go to school so my time is very limited and this location is convenient for me.
This place has the best service of all rapid cash locations.
The associates all work with you to make sure you understand the process completely and with a friendly attitude.
No one wants to come in for a loan, but when you need it to, its as painless as possible.
Always does a great job for me and i appreciate her service.
Always very kind and helpful.
They continue to do what they can to help with lowering our premiums.
This is no longer the closest location for us but we have stayed with them.
Melissa is the best!!!
I have a concussion and she helped me out and i felt safe and secure.
Best customer service ever!
Larry keever has been in the industry for a long time and knows how to provide great service to customers.
The staff is amazing and very knowledgeable!
Whether big or small, they're quick at getting back to me, answering my questions and taking care of my requests.
I am very satisfied working with such fine gentlemen.
Shaine, carlos, joe and logan.
Please keep it up, guys!!
This is the key gym for downtown working folks.
It has everything a person wanting to work out could want.
A pool for laps....treadmills and plenty of equipment along with classes throughout the day.
In addition, they have a little grill/sandwich place which has good inexpensive lunch food.
The one thing to keep in mind is that it can get crowded at some key times.....lunch and around 5pm.
Mornings are not that bad and all and all it is a good place with a nice helpful staff.
I'm a huge fan of sunwest!
This location is definately the most convenient to get to besides the cactus branch.
The staff at this location is very friendly and always willing to help you out.
If you need a loan ask if you qualify...
They will be more than willing to sit you down and talk over some options you may qualify for.
I'm happy sunwest locations are open saturdays now!
I can see how that's awesome for those who work a five to nine job.
Now if they all had drive through windows!
No more parking issues since it is in another shopping complex that offers ample parking.
5 stars for me.
The other day jaime helped me out and was super helpful!
Everyone i've encountered at this location are never in a bad mood and seem like team players.
Always assisting each other and their guests when needed!
Awesome staff and service!
Plus, midfirst is an amazing bank in general.
I would highly recommend midfirst and to stop at the location in chandler!
This review is strictly about one of the reps cullen.
Highly recommend him if your having any issues
This wells fargo location is amazing!
I've been in here twice and both times were great.
I definitely will be returning to this location as needed.
They have the nicest security guard ever.
He greets you as you walk in and wishes you a good day when you leave.
Give this man a raise!
Nice, simple, easy for a complicated transaction.
Should have gotten everyone's name.
They were all  professional and friendly
I haven't even been a customer that long but i liked how the people here usually go above and beyond.
Wow, after reading the reviews here on yelp i decided to open a bank account at pinnacle.
All i can say is wow!
I've never been treated so good by any other bank.
Personalized attention and a free checking account.
Personalized the way it used to be in the old days.
Especially from one of your employees named felicia.
She had a beautiful smile and was very curtious.
Oh, and bye felicia lol your company is lucky to have her.
Can't speak on the customer service because came here on a saturday.
I hoped there was an atm or branch alot closer to treasure island.
Unfortunately the atm that was at t.i.
Was closed indefinitely and i didnt want to use the atm's at the casinos bc of the $6.99 withdrawal fee.
Yeah call me cheap, whatever.
4 stars for saving me $6.99 and being the closest.
Maybe open one closer or add a chase atm on the strip for other customers.
I always have a good experience at this bank, and it's been our bank for years.
The only thing i can't stand is the remodeling of the teller windows.
I can't hear what the heck the teller is saying to me, though they can hear me loud and clear.
Always nice happy people no matter what day or time.
Fast, speedy, friendly people.
Most like to chat, and when you come in the door there's always someone asking what you need today.
I also noticed they have coffee and cookies now.
One unfortunate event i had was when i needed checks and was sat down with this lady.
Don't know her name but she didn't care to service me and it really showed.
We were in a financial bind and cash 1 was there to help us when no other lending institution would.
Loans are generally $100 to $2,500.
Be careful and choose the amount best for you and bi-weekly payment.
This chase bank has been at this location for over 20 years.
The tellers are friendly and quick and the personal bankers are nice as well.
I have never had any problems with this location.
Always clean, efficient and friendly!
Extremely helpful and fast staff.
They try their best to fix any problems and actually know what they are doing.
My only gripe is that the wells fargo internal system does  not give them the autonomy to fix everything.
Some situations are strange and require a human w/ common knowledge and not a computer program.
She is very professional and is in the process with helping me resolve a situation i am in.
I am happy with the support i get from bank of america.
I highly recommend everyone to signup with bank of america at this location.
This is my branch.
The assistant manager is so very professional and kind.
I sometimes can get frustrated with the company as a whole, but this branch is amazing.
Great customer service from bofa banker gladis!
Very thoughtful and took great care in helping me with my questions.
I have always had great experiences at this location!!
Wanda is an account whiz and is extremely personable.
I used to be with bofa, customer service was 2 stars at best...  horrible account representation which made us leave.
Thank you  wanda k with chase for your continual help!
Lynn hennessy's experience with home, auto, and life insurance is second to none.
This office provides a service that is truly a cut above the rest!
I love that there is always a branch close by whenever i need them.
I have been in sured by lynn hennessy for 12 years.
The passion these ladies have on educating you on insurance is amazing.
You can tell she is an agent who goes above and beyond.
I really enjoy working with lynn and her team, they work very hard and out of integrity.
That is hard to find in the insurance world now adays.
I love the customer service here.
They process patrons through the lines quickly.
They lost a star because of the horrid parking situation.
The staff here are great!
Some of them have been here for years!
If you want top of the line banking customer service this this rocks!
The staff is always friendly when i come to this location.
There is usually a staff member nearby asking if you need assistance and will direct you to the appropriate area.
The inside is well kept and clean.
I don't know much about $100,000 fishermen's loans in nova scotia.
What i do know is that this particular branch of rbc has been very easy to deal with.
When i showed up with all of $2k to start an rrsp, they did not laugh in my face.
You know what else rbc has going for it?
Their atms dispense $5 notes, not just 20s.
I don't have that problem.
Dana and myles are the best!
We have a painting business in middleton and they have been extremely helpful for all our financial needs!
My go to gym during the week for several years!
The convenience can't be beat if you work uptown.
I've tried dowd, and the gateway location would be a hassle to jump on and off the trolley.
Everything you could ask for in a gym.....classes, equipment, swimming, basketball courts, track, lockers and towel service!
Not sure of the management as the staff has been constantly changing here lately.
I absolutely love this bank!
Not with these guys!!
They definitely gave me a different outlook on banking!
Shout out to the teller, alex gonzales, for dealing with a rude customer.
I believe he did a great job handling the situation with a customer who does not agree with chase's policy.
He did it very professionally and very efficiently, especially during this busy holliday week.
He definitely deserves a reward, or a raise.
He represents the company well!
Dvcu consistently offers us the best rates.
So far, we have taken out four car loans and a boat loan.
The online loan process is simple, and our approval came back instantly after hitting the submit button.
I have nothing less than praises to give this credit union.
Always welcoming me when i walk in.
Also reopened my savings, great manager who gave me a temporary debit card when i lost my wallet.
Never had a bad encounter with anyone here & that says something.
This one is the biggest branch.
When and if it gets busy, the line still goes fast because they have a lot of tellers.
Very helpful and knowledgeable.
Would definitely recommend setting up an account through them.
The lines move fast and the staff are always really friendly and relaxed.
The building really does look like something out of a movie- it's always a pleasure to pay a visit!
M molloy provided a great service and was tremendously helpful throughout all three of my financings he helped me with.
He is very patient and explains the options and process very clearly.
I felt he worked very hard and went beyond to find the best mortgage option for me each time.
I always recommend him!
With all the hostility held towards banks now-a-days, this branch has been nothing but accommodating and friendly.
My initial review was lackluster due to how long i was held up.
Even the initial teller was nice, so their willingness to aid was not the issue.
Like a bonehead, i misplaced my debit card and had to get it replaced.
Danelle made it painless.
I like walking into a place, not care who i get, and leave not feeling like a number.
I went to this bank at noon on a friday.
I thought the service was prompt and helpful.
I don't know why everyone has left such bad reviews.
I liked the service.
The teller ladies all seemed so nice.
Don't believe every bad review on yelp.
I'd go here again.
Their rates have also gone down and  no initiation fees anymore - yeah!
Throw in free classes and a pool and they beat a lot of places hands down.
This credit union is one of the best i've been to.
Every time i come in the lines move fast, the tellers are happy, and there are never any issues.
I have even considered switching because of the great consistency in customer service.
Everything good so far.
Walked in to take advantage of their new customer deal.
Such honesty is priceless!
No reason to bank anywhere else!
Update: turns out they dont allow transfering of money to family members that have discover bank.
Will change to another bank as soon as they paid out the $300 new customer bonus.
Been with sce federal for almost 3 years now and love them!!
I am very happy with the service i get...
I don't feel like "just another customer" like at the big banks...
I feel like they actually care about me as an individual.
He goes above and beyond to make sure that i am taken care of.
His dedication to his customers is extraordinary.
I can't say enough about how awesome she is.
Extremely pleased with shaine and his team and state farm.
He provided exactly the coverage i needed without all the hassle and irrelevancies.
I like this particular branch of wells fargo.
The people there are always on it with service.
Atms have accepted cash every time i've been through.
Looking at the other reviews for branches looks as if i chose the best one around me to go to.
With atm's and everything!
Get cash whenever you want!
Seriously though, the times i've actually been inside, the employees were all very helpful and nice.
This bank is fantastic!
Overall, i would definitely recommend banking here!
Absolutely love this bank (how it is possible to love a bank, i honestly don't know).
The address given on the website is 4925 n. 20th st, phoenix, az, 85016.
One-on-one attention, never crowded, use wells fargo atm...love it.
He is a humble and knowledgeable banker.
You can tell he has a big heart and is non judgmental.
Arizona needs to keep their money local and not to the cut and dry big banks.
We were looking to re-finance our truck loan and canyon state delivered.
Rate is awesome, service was excellent and we couldn't be happier.
Thank you canyon state!
I have had nothing but excellent experiences with them from account opening, to notary service to shared branching, etc.
Everyone is nice- everyone is helpful.
I would highly recommend them over any traditional bank.
I think this location is pretty good.
This branch is great.
What makes it great is all the people working there.
They are quick, prompt and polite.
They always have smiles on there faces and they are actually helpful.
They aren't just annoyed at their jobs and passing the time.
Give them a chance and don't base your decision off the other reviews
I continue to have outstanding service at this bank.
What did surprise me was how calmly she handled herself.
I don't know that i could keep my cool as well as she did!
Sabrina no longer works here.
However, we have had wonderful service from eric as well as the branch manager.
If you want to be taken care of, go to this branch!
You can't really get much better than this for a gym in the immediate uptown area.
Make sure to avoid at your typical peak times to maximize the experience.
I like to block off an hour on my calendar mid-morning or afternoon and have the whole place to myself.
I always see one of our evp's around these same times, great minds think alike!
I just opened a business account at this bank today.
Everyone is extremely friendly and helpful and makes you feel like you have known them for years.
I am looking forward to working with pinnacle bank for many years.
Nicole and jacky were also great!
My favorite chase branch, teller line always moves rapidly, plenty of parking in the parking lot.
This locale is within walking distance of my apartment complex.
The lobby area is nice but i don't go in very much at all.
Eat, drink, and be merry my friends!!!!
Bouvier is the man.
Really made me feel like a million dollar customer.
I went in looking for two suits and really had next to no knowledge on suits and suit fashion.
He educated me, enlightened me and ultimately made me look good.
I am feeling confident in my purchases and will be a loyal jos a bank customer for a long time.
Signed up with them a few months ago.
Really nice staff and locations.
Online capabilities are really good too.
I was very happy with my experience here.
Even though my account is with a different out-of-state credit union, the staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful to me.
Daniela was great at customer service, as was the manager assisting her.
I expect i will open an account with them soon!
What an amazing experience i had working with chad b!
He doesn't just do his job, he exceeds the standards.
I opened an account and applied for a credit card.
He was a huge help.
He walked me through the process and explained everything while teaching me some things i hadn't known along the way.
He has a great personality and a good head on his shoulders.
Wells fargo bank is lucky to have him.
If you see this chad, thank you :)
Went to pay my home equity loan today.
The greeter person was super helpful by telling me what i needed to go to the teller.
If you need a business account, this is the place to go!
We've worked with bryon and he is amazing.
Knows what to do to handle your account and make banking a breeze.
Totally worth the pain of switching banks!
I have been banking with wells for a few years now.
Everyone at this branch is always very nice and ready to help.
Shaine stevenson and team always helpful and on top of taking care of my family's  insurance needs.
Very friendly and there for us with any questions we have.
I have been a customer with sce for many years and the service is always exceptional.
Thank you ludi for always going that extra mile for me.
Thank you kim, phil and patrice with all your excitement for me when purchasing my new vehicle.
You all made the process wonderful.
Sce beltway/sahara - a great place for banking.
This place was amazing, staff was extremely helpful and professional.
I'm a big muscular guy so i had to go with suit separates and needed to have the suit tailored.
So they called estera bec (tailor on site) from the back who immediately started fitting me for the suit.
I needed the suit in a week and she said she will get it done.
My advice is don't argue with her tell her what you want and let her do her magic.
I wanted a nice fitted v taper look in the jacket and nice fitted pants.
I showed up the day before the wedding to try on my suit with shirt and shoes i brought.
The suit looked amazing.
Well fitted and way better than i could had expected.
When trying on the suit she commented on my shirt was way to baggy and fitted poorly.
Which she was right.
She asked when the wedding was and i told her tomorrow.
She sure did fit and tailor the shirt for me in 20mins.
All came out fitted amazing with that nice form fitted look i wanted.
I will always come to her as she is amazing and a huge asset to josh a banks.
I just discovered this branch around the corner from my house a few weeks ago.
At first it took a minute for me to find it.
It is located on the south side of windmill (across the street from bachi burger) in the vons shopping center.
Not actually located in vons but on the corner of the main building.
The building is pristine and looks to be fairly new.
What i like most about this branch is that (*knock on wood*) i've always gotten fast and friendly service here.
The tellers always greet me with a smile and are very helpful.
I think i'm going to make this my go-to wells fargo branch for the time being.
One of the better branches i've ever been for wf.
They were nice, knowledgeable and easy to work with.
I have had a mix of experiences with different branches--some were not great--some were so so.
I brought in my $29 worth of penny rolls.
Teller was helpful with no judgments and made little conversation with me.
I like when tellers genuinely ask how i'm doing rather than saying it like going through the motions.
Also great eye contact.
This place is staffed with competent and friendly people.
They handle things other branches can't.
I love going to this location.
People that work here seem to love their job and it shows.
Super attentive and willing to help with whatever grown up things you gotta take care of.
As a pnc customer, l love having this branch location close to where i work.
The employees are really friendly and the service is very good here.
I'm usually in and out in a few minutes.
This bank is everything i need.
I wouldn't trade banking with nfcu for any other!
I have never had a problem with them and their customer service is above other places i have banked with.
My only criticism is that i wish they had more convenient locations!
This is the only one in all of vegas.
Dwayne is a veteran professional in the insurance field.
He's a has a down to earth and genuine vibe and is a mentor of mine.
They even waived some fees to get money sent out.
My experience at this chase bank started out in the parking lot.
I had to park right behind a bus stop that had some rather "unique" looking characters waiting.
It's nice to see that people can be rewarded for i conveniences even without complaining.
Thanks to her and her understanding id go back.
Thanks young lady, i appreciate ya!
Everyone at this bank has always gone out of there way to help us make good financial decisions.
Every time we go this location it is so easy and stress free!
We highly recommend this bank!!
Moved over from b of a.
This branch is friendly and fast.
Hate having to go to the bank, but at least this place makes it just a bit better.
Love their cookies too!
This is the friendliest wells fargo i have ever been to!
Every employee who comes across you greets you which is also very pleasant.
I've never been here before but i will definitely be back.
Went to the bank to deal with some change of address, etc.
And lorna was very polite, helpful, and efficient.
Best visit i've had and i've been a member since 2009.
This is great bank.
Remember when banking was personal well midfirst is what banking used to be.
Their friendly knowledgeable staff have worked with us on our personal banking and business banking.
I have recommended them to my friends and family.
They also have a great kids program for savings.
Their hours are great too open sat.
So far so good.
I've only been with them a day, but no fees if you have direct deposit have electronic statements.
I got a printed debit card right then and there!
The service at this location is always excellent.
The staff is practically falling all over themselves to be helpful.
If i wait for something more than a minute, i get profuse apologies.
We used their safety deposit box service which worked very well for us, and was always very easy to access.
I used the facilities at the ymca a few times during my recent stay at the hilton next door.
I appreciated that hotel guests got access to a full-sized gym instead of a dinky hotel gym.
I found the layout of the ymca to be cramped and a bit uncomfortable.
The hours make sense for the office environment but i really wish it would've stayed open later than 9pm.
The best part of the ymca is how clean it is.
Tellers here are great.
They don't bombard me with the usual sales pitches.
Personal bankers are awesome about account issues and super friendly.
I truly feel like they present solutions and not just sales.
This is my favorite branch.
The promo to try this card out helped.
Other perks are almost the same as most annual fee cards i.e.
Extended warranty, lounge access for a fee etc.
Some stores which are recorded as grocery stores/restaurants for other cards show up as a normal purchase.
Also the best usage for point redemption is travel purchases charged to this card.
One can redeem for other merchandise but its not worth it in my experience.
4 stars as this one of the best rewards cards out there with excellent perks.
They have opened a new world of banking for me with online banking .
Who's looking for a bank to do notarization on our sons cremation plot at the cemetery.
None of the banks do notary anymore have to go to ups or fedex store.
God bless you, thank you
There are few agents who care so much about their clients.
I have personally experienced the care and concern lynn had for her insureds during a claim.
Better than taking out a loan a payday loan or going to dollar loan center.
Keep in mind, they check your credit with a hard inquiry every time you open/refinance.
Needed a signature guaranteed and my normal wf  branch didn't have an authorized employee.
Went here on christmas eve; promptly greeted by a couple of super friendly employees.
Waited just a minute or two and dallas york hooked it up; in and out and no fuss.
I would definitely revisit if ever in the area!
Chase bank has always been good to me.
Great service, always fully  staffed!
When we moved here from california, they were willing do what ever was necessary to make the transfer smooth.
They have a drive through atm, as well they also have a walk up atm.
I am a sold customer of theirs!
Our hoa also banks with this same branch.
When i became treasurer, they sat me down and explained and helped me about everything.
I really like how concerned they are about our accounts.
Been with this location for the past seven years and can say nothing but good things about this place.
It used to be located inside vons, but they recently move in 2013 to a open spot next to it.
Their customer service is always on point and i'm always greeted with smiles.
I like this branch.
Always many clients but tellers are very experienced .
This is the  best run wells fargo bank i have ever been too.
The bankers are friendly and very knowledgable.
That why i have been coming here for years!
Being from out of town, it was nice to have just as friendly of a staff here, as back home.
Friendly, helpful and quick.
I wish that it was a little closer to las vegas blvd though...
This will be the 3rd time i've added a bank into yelp!
The bank of open 9-5 m-f and 9-1 on saturday.
It's a branch, so you can do all your transaction at this location.
I think this is the only nfcu in the vegas area, probably to serve the nearby nellis afb.
No fees for withdrawal if you withdraw from other credit union atm's.
After having way too many problems with associated, my boyfriend and i switched over the uw credit.
Some one was available to do the process when we walked in the door.
The person we worked with was incredibly nice and seemed amused by our astonished reactions to their policies.
We have been using them ever since and haven't had an issue.
My boyfriend and i are still not used to it.
We're constantly expecting to screwed over, but it hasn't happened once!
The verify log in made linking to paypal and amazon payments a little difficult, but it wasn't too bad.
I love verify log ins so i'm pretty happy about it, despite the inconveniences.
If you're thinking about switching, i highly suggest making the plunge.
I'm mad at myself for ever dealing with banks when i could have been using a credit union.
You can get your debut card printed on the spot!!
The staff are always friendly and though there can be a long line of customers..
There are a lot of tellers!
Td's media team wants us to believe they're the best out there for canada.
They say that banking can be comfortable (have you gone through the mortgage process?!?)
And that they're voted #1 customer service for years.
Actually, to some degree it is.
This bank in particular is well staffed at the teller counter.
The line ups are never longer than 2 people.
The atms are my choice ... it's fast and i'm on there to get cash on the odd occasion.
The financial service reps are all helpful and they're willing to answer questions.
It's really to book an appointment here if you want to discuss something.
There are varying degrees of expertise so make sure you specifiy what you want done ahead of time!
Not all of them can do stocks, mutual funds, or big mortgage applications.
I've never had an issue with this particular bank and everyone is always pleasant.
So maybe banking can be this comfortable?
The young lady who assisted me was prompt, friendly and efficient.
I was pleased, especially considering it was a saturday in a busy grocery store.
Great service all the way around!
All the recent bad publicity about wells fargo is just simply not true.
I've been banking at the bell and tatum branch and i've always received excellent service.
Everyone there is very professional and courteous and i've never had any account opened without my permission.
This location is my favorite place to bank because it's not crowded and busy like other places.
On the inside...well, it's a bank, you can imagine.
They speak spanish and english.
The tellers are friendly and sweet; they always ask how my day is going.
Outside, they have a drive-thru, which, as always, is super convenient.
Overall, this is a nice, quiet location to get your banking done.
We all have a favorite place to bank and so do i.  i love banking with desert schools.
My husband and i have been members for years.
I love the fact that their notary services are free.
The staff there is always helpful and i don't feel pressured to buy into any of their services.
If you are new to the area and need a bank i recommend desert schools over all the others.
Opened an account a couple of weeks ago.
Very good customer service.
Everyone greeted us with a smile and we were helped quickly.
We went in on a saturday--all branches are open on sats 9-1, which is very convenient.
We opened a few accounts and applied for a loan.
A few days later, the account manager called to tell us the loan was approved.
Here--there are no conditions.
They have a drive through location at this location.
They've also recently added e-banking and online bill pay.
They don't have mobile deposit yet.
We switched from arizona federal credit union.
Two years ago, az federal started charging membership fees which i can only describe as very un-credit-union-like.
What's worse is that they spend $ on ridiculous tchotchkes and promotions.
I'm interested in banks lowering my fees, expanding hours, making e-banking easier, and giving me a decent rate.
That is what sunwest is obviously spending their money on.
I really appreciate that--they aren't wasting money on things that don't matter.
Overall, it's been an excellent experience so far.
I highly recommend them.
After having been through a few national banks i have finally found a great branch with amazing tellers.
Sec is a great bank that offers amazing service with great banking options.
I literally have had nothing but great interactions with this branch.
I could not have received better support from the folks at the credit union.
As we were leaving, chris gave my 8-year-old star wars stickers, and talked (and really listened!)
With him about a video game he is playing.
My son was beaming!
A potentially boring trip had a definite highlight.
(he told me that the bank errand was long, but not boring.)
I recommend this credit union near the capitol.
And i feel at ease that these guys!
They know what they are doing, and i am sure we (especially my traveling daughter) will be in secure hands.
Very friendly and customer service oriented.
Ryan p. & eric h. took great care of me.
I was very impressed.
Knowledgeable staff makes getting questions answered easy and fast.
I would highly recommend them.
Shaine stevenson's office is always quick to help with last minute requests and get the info we need!
They jump right on the task and get it done!
It's always a pleasure to work with them!
What a pleasure and great experience!
The branch manager marshel was excellent and took care of me.
Very professional and great customer service!
What a breath of fresh air after having a nightmare experience with bank of america.
This chase branch took care of business painlessly and professionally---the way it should be!
I greatly appreciate your wonderful customer service and professionalism!
I just joined here, and i love it.
I've never really had to wait for a machine, even when it's "busy."
Probably a convenient location only if you live downtown, like i do.
Very clean, very friendly staff.
Great customer service here.
They are so helpful and always see to your needs the moment you enter the bank.
Come to this branch and they notarize your documents in no time, free of charge...
Great experience every time i go to this location!
Cassie has been a great help and i definitely  recommend her if you have to go in the branch!
I will be going to this location as long as i live in vegas!
The squirrel hill branch is great.
From the manager down to the tellers they  care and are professional and get the work done.
Their online banking interface is great with quicken.
I cannot believe i am yelping about a bank, but here is why.
About 6 years ago i was with another squirrel hill bank.
I swore up and down that these guys new what customer service is...the i moved to pnc.
I was wrong about my bank.
At this branch:  -you get a greeting every time you walk in.
If the desk welcomer isn't there, through esp or something, a non-teller employee will shoot you a very happy greeting.
-a bank sans tellers?
Also they are freaking so sweet your teeth hurt when you're done.
-forgot your account number?
Give 'em your debit card and they will fill out a deposit slip for you.
-ascetics...this place looks like gringotts from harry potter, but no ugly goblins here.
I get calls from them about once every 2 months (not annoying, but don't feel ignored) to diversify my money.
Want to say "no", no worries.
But, pnc feels like they actually care...yeah!
Good ol' customer service.
A+++++ i will never use another branch or bank!
Words can not express how greatful i am for the shaine stevenson office staff.
From the moment you walk in you are greeted by warm smiles and immediate attention.
Everyone there is knowledgeable and the smiles make you feel right at home.
I appreciate the kindness you all showed me and my daughter on our previous visit.
From offering us water to giving her paper and markers to color while i handled my situation.
The customer service was top notch!!!!
I feel honored to say that i have the best state farm branch!!!
Keep up the great work!!!!!
I swear as much as there's many people working there.
There's alway a waiting of 10mins or more.
You sit in the waiting area and would look aimlessly hoping someone will greet you.
But no one til you're called on you.
But when you're in their cubicle, things goes smoothly.
Every single time the staffs are very friendly and i love it.
They are prompt once you sit down in front of them.
But the initial greeting just isn't there.
Making a really bad first impression.
So i tried to dodge going in as much as i can.
Doing most of my business with the drive thru atm machine!
I walk by here often, and the outside has never been unkempt whenever i've strolled by.
This location is quick and easy to get to.
Just wish there were more locations in vegas.
Customer service is always above average.
I've been with state farm for 3 years thank you for always being there for me.
Never go inside and do almost all my banking needs through the atm.
This one had two drive through atm along with 3 drive through if you needed to use the teller.
Good little branch locates beside smith's on corner of tropicana and jones.
Manager is helpful, all employees are nice, several kiosks open but usually one person working the line.
I've banked at this credit union for over a year now.
Recommended it to several friends whom also bank there now.
Tellers are pleasant; service is fairly quick.
You can get a debit card the same day you open an account, and funds deposited are usually available immediately.
They also have a great app for your phone that allows you to check balances and make transfers with ease.
Hard to find a fair and reliable freight factoring company these days.
I definitely trust pcg!
Clerks are polite but also efficient & quick in what they do.
Never had a problem.
Very helpful tellers and bank officers.
True, staff has been cut down, but that's not the branch's fault.
Staff is very pleasant and capable.
Close to home and convenient.
I like the no fee checking they offer which no other bank in phoenix offered me.
No minimum balance to maintain.
I find them very friendly efficient and professional.
This is my favorite center city ymca.
It's extremely convenient, being that i work in 2 wells fargo.
But even when i'm not in the office i try going to this ymca.
This place has amazing service.
Just left from bringing my husband in to get fitted for a suit.
Candy, one of their associates, picked out some wonderful options and had a great eye for matching pieces.
She was very positive and happy to help.
If you need some guidance and want something that looks nice, definitely come here!
Resting in the wells fargo tower, you'll find this older, but newly remodeled, modest ymca.
The staff here is super friendly.
Much of the equipment is new.
The lap-pool and lorckerrooms were recently updated.
They offer numerous group exercise options, etc.
There is a walking/running track that hovers above the center court on a secret second level.
In addition to the track you'll find an area for cycling classes, more workout equipment, etc.
Within the lorckerrooms are saunas and steam rooms as well.
Parking is in the deck off of mlk.
Just keep in mind that the validation is only good for 2 1/2 hours.
The orange and green levels of the parking deck are designated for y visitors.
Check it out if you're ever in need of an uptown workout.
It's a great spot before or after work for persons that commute to the area daily.
The service is good but this location doesn't have lockers.
My wife has an account here.
I just sit in the car most of the times.
She is always happy with the service she gets here.
Only hang us as with most banked now they have closed the drive up teller.
The part i get most benefit from is we can get money for europe and other countries we travel to.
The bank i use most does not do this so that is a big plus for me.
The times i have been in everyone has treated us we.
Quick in and out most of the times.
By far the best cu i have ever been with.
Account setup was easy.
Got a call from member services providing me my account information as well as how to navigate their online system.
They offered me additional credit services that i also qualified for.
She asked if one of her members could contact me at a later time.
She took my account info and i was contacted by a member later that day who helped assist me.
I was looking for a new business bank for my small business.
My wife found comerica bank by reading the rave reviews online.
I went into the central and osborn location and was blown away by their amazing customer service.
They spent almost 2 hours with me helping me get the proper paperwork to open an account.
Based upon my experience i am also moving over my household personal accounts to this bank as well.
I highly comerica bank and especially the brank at central and osborn.
Rich rigali husband of kelley h.
I visited on monday 10/31 and was assisted by a banker named deorella.
I visited again on tuesday 11/1 only to find out the check was forged and cashed.
Deorella helped me open a case and provided me with details on the forged check as well photocopies.
She had also introduced me to the branch manager to provide with further assistance through out this case.
It is friday 11/4 and the amount has been credited back to my account without any fee.
I just wanted to thank deorella for all her help and personableness.
She was extremely patient and willing to make sure my needs were taken care of.
They had money in the 24hr atms.
Card activated on the door entrance during non-business hours.
Easy location on decatur, about 2 miles east of flamingo.
2 drive thru's (atm)  i've only been inside once but the service was prompt.
(i was the only customer, so i guess thats good).
I use this location more so for the atm.
They have one on the inside as well that's open on the weekends.
Clean, never broken "out of order".
So, that's always a plus.
I have been a chase bank customer for years, this particular location is close to my house.
This branch is spacious, well lit, clean and the customer service is great.
Chase has added an inside atm machine for deposits, withdraws, etc.
I will continue to be a chase customer.
I have been a member of 1st bank since last november.
Absolutely recommend banking at 1st bank!
We couldn't have found anyone more helpful!
Candi was there every step of the way to help all of the guys find just the right suits.
Her follow through was excellent , and we are so appreciative of all she did!!
These people have been so much help, any rapid cash i have ever gone into has always been really helpful.
Thankfully, they were able to help me in an emergency situation.
Now that everything has been taken care of i will look into rapid cash if anything ever comes up unexpectedly.
Linda dyster and her staff are super helpful and always very professional.
Been with this agency for over 5 years.
Yes, it is a bank but it is my neighborhood bank that has fast friendly services.
Besides teller service they offer all banking services to meet your needs.
This location is on the corner of 7th street and glendale.
There is plenty if parking and a drive thru for quick access to your cash.
Never had any problems only to receive outstanding customer service.
Great location and clean gym.
Joined this ymca when i began working uptown.
Fully equipped locker room offering convenient way to shower before heading back to the office.
Great variety of machines and indoor pool.
Can see basketball court and classes from machines.
They offer a variety of classes, from yoga to zumba to weights.
Also have indoor track.
Great gym and great price!
Nancy was patient, compassionate, and extremely knowledgeable.
She was also very helpful and kind and was able to give us all the information needed.
As we were leaving that day, it was pouring rain.
One of the other bank employees helped us to the car while holding an umbrella over us.
That is amazing customer service!!
Lynn is my life/health/disability insurance agent.
I enjoy this location because it's laid out well & isn't overly expansive.
It's got just enough of what you need without getting you lost.
Pro-tip** they validate parking in the wells fargo parking garage.
Worth the drive from surprise:).
They also tell me there is a mobile app for those times i can't get away.
I've always been spoiled by tcf - thank you!!
Great service , very helpful and respectful service,highly recommend!!
I got into the bank and got an immediate service ,the guy was very helpful and fast!!
The tellers are always super nice and helpful.
And i'm sure they put up with a lot of nasty customers at this location.
I work in uptown and decided to go to this location vs the dowd to avoid the crazy crowd.
I go around 6pm every day and i never seem to have a problem with getting on machines or equipment.
The locker rooms are nice and big, plus you can rent lockers.
They also offer free daily lock rentals from the front desk, but they only have a limited number.
They recently updated their elliptical machines, and the majority of their equipment is fairly new.
I love that they have a stair master (maybe 5), as well as a variety of treadmills (10-12).
There's also a nice 1/9 track up stairs, along with a cycle studio.
In addition, the basketball court in the middle of the gym is great for people watching ha!
What really draws me to this location is the size of the gym.
It's simple to navigate and i never have to fight for a machine.
It's convenient, clean, updated and the staff is super helpful!
Best agent in town!
Dwayne and his wonderful staff have assisted me with renters/life/and auto.
Whether i was living in the state or directing me to another agent near me.
Keeping someone i could trust close to me when moving around for school and work is very important to me.
Give them a call, i know they will take care of you!
Even though i have not been a fan of pnc in the past i am very happy with this branch.
The people are friendly, polite and efficient with whichever problem you come to them with.
The waits are short and hassle-free.
Great branch, will use again.
Clean, well organized store, and the staff there is very helpful.
Marlin is the man.
Pnc bank is pretty ubiquitous across pittsburgh (guess what the p in pnc stands for).
This particular location has a convenient atm outside of the building on 18th.
Street parking is a bit rough in the area, but the lot across the street is super cheap.
Again, i prefer the dowd ymca because it's huge and has pretty much anything you'd ever want from a gym.
I head to the gateway y when i need a quick treadmill work-out or lift and nothing else.
The uptown y provides a nice middle-ground.
There's a half-court basketball set-up, which allows for pick-up games and shooting.
I prefer the full-court action at the y, but this isn't a bad alternative.
The best thing at uptown branch, though, is its huge pool--great for laps and other water workouts.
Check it out: it's impressive.
Overall, this gym has a really new, clean feel, which is obviously something you'd want from a gym.
Never too crowded, either.
Super nice tellers, walked me through the whole strange experience with me feeling moronic.
Would love to this bank on a heartbeat but too far to go now, not.
Any other branches in vegas i know of.
Drive thru was fast and efficient.
Lines were not long either.
Teller was very friendly.
Location is not very busy all the times just on thursday and fridays of course.
Mostly in the afternoon when people are getting off.
This branch is closest to my house.
It's nice when a neighborhood bank treats you like a neighbor.
I have always had good customer service here.
When i needed to have something notarized, i was able to see a notary without waiting.
There was no charge.
They have really good rates with their loans and friendly staff.
Services are accessible remotely online and they give reimbursement on any of the atm fees.
If only i was willing to do more business with bofa.
The teller was very friendly and not pushy at all when he learned that i was not a member.
Just a girl trying to cash a check.
Very clean, friendly and personable staff and i got out of there pretty quickly.
Wow my 200th review!
So much pressure... ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  hard to believe i could like any bank.
But this one branch of a wells fargo bank definitely is an oasis in this desert town.
Even during christmas and right before any holiday they provide good service.
Others, like me, don't mind going online, or use their drive up atm.
It's a small bank that really gets to know its long term regular customers like my relatives.
Overall it's a relatively pain free banking experience mainly cuz they're quick.
Parking is easy, and it's in a decent neighborhood conveniently located near wal mart and albertson's grocery sotres.
Jm at the beaches location is exceptional.
We are fortunate to have found him and secured an good rate.
Whenever i need my checks cashed or to make a deposit i always come to this location.
It's down the street and i always get awesome service.
My dogs love this place as much as i do now.
This is my favorite ymca to work out on saturdays and sundays.
The facility is clean and recently remodeled.
Parking in the building is validated on saturdays and weekdays after 4:30 pm.
Even most other days, it's generally less packed than the dowd down the street.
The ymca's as a whole in charlotte are better than a lot of other gyms.
I bank with the main giants.
Wells fargo is one of those giant banks.
I am going to review the service of the location.
So if you want a review on the evils of big bank america, you won't find it here.
I needed to get some documents notorized.
I remember hearing that wells fargo did this for free if you have a certain account.
I sat and waited for the the associate to come get me.
I only waited for a few minutes.
I sat next to a kid who looked like he was getting ready to be interviewed.
I was then greeted by the well fargo associate and went to his office space.
His name was paulo and he was a financial advisor for wells fargo.
He was very friendly.
I was happy that i didn't run into anyone that looked like they hated their job at this branch.
We had a long conversation which was great.
I have two small children so an adult conversation is always a breathe of fresh air.
Overall if i needed to do some banking at wells fargo i will most likely be at this branch.
If you are in the area check them out.
I just left this branch after opening up a business checking account with manny ramirez.
I can't say enough great things about him.
He was easy to talk to, did not push any unwanted products, and had great all-around customer service.
Thanks again manny, look forward to doing more banking with you guys in the future!
Julianna at the south rainbow location made the whole process easy and was very helpful with the entire thing.
She made me feel very comfortable and confident in the loan.
It was my first time and honestly i was weary at first.
But thanks to julianna it's all good... tell julianna jeremy powell sent ya and you will also receive a bonus..
I've been with sunwwest for 4 years now and have been consistently happy with the service they provide.
I always recieve friendly customer srevice, timely respnses, and will continue to bank with them.
The staff is incredibly helpful and they know customer service.
Joey is very professional and personable, as well as the rest of the employees.
I use this wells fargo for business banking and i have always had great customer service here.
Sometimes the lines can get long but that is the case with any bank.
I've had a navy federal account since i was 2 years old.
I avoided the lines by not going on popular days like friday-monday.
Try going mid week or off hours and you can practically walk to the head of the line.
The complaints on the staff seem out of place as well.
I've always been greeted at the door by a hello and a smile.
At the counter the tellers are equally as approachable and willing to go the extra mile for you.
The atm out front is well lit and easy to use.
I haven't been to the new location yet but that should help elevate some of the line concerns.
Even if it doesn't i think the most time i've spent on line has been ten minutes.
Almost forgot, it is a credit union and their rates on loans and mortgages are phenomenal.
If you qualify for one you will have a hard time beating them.
Best in town, never known a bank that will go out of their way to help you.
They have helped me out of so many jams, can't say enough great things.
Guess the 5 stars tell it all.
An awesome employee named rashad helped me we was a window clerk.....
We are super grateful for the advice, service, and time.
Very satisfied with their service.
Had the pleasure to deal with omar mendez and his manager.
They were both fabulous, answered all my questions and solved all my banking problems.
Definitely went above and beyond.
A+ for customer service.
This bank is amazing!
The customer service is bar none exceptional.
Great service is beautiful.
This one is a smaller branch that you may just miss if you are walking by.
There were only two teller wickets open when i came in.
I had a large cheque to toss into my account.
The cheque from from another bank and i was prepared they'd put the whole amount on hold.
I got to the teller almost immediately as there was only one person in front of me.
She reviewed and cheque and listened to my plea.
Unfortunately, my recent history didn't show any cheques of such caliber from that payer.
"let me see what i can do," said she and ran off to fetch the manager.
The manager came in, reviewed my case, and asked me how much money i needed right away.
I told him the amount i thought they'd have no problem releasing.
Wow, you just asked the right guy!
I showed him my phone with the yelp open and the first line of this review entered.
There always seems to be a promotion for opening a checking account.)
This is my local wachovia branch.
Cars often line up at the drive-through atm, but luckily, the branch finally installed a walk-up atm.
There have been many bar-hoppers who have walked through the drive-through in need of some cash.
I'd normally be somewhat indifferent to a bank branch, but i had a really great experience with this one.
I was paying for some jeans on a recent day when i realized i didn't have my debit card.
I retraced my steps and realized that i never got it back from the walk-up wachovia atm.
I got to the branch and the manager was very helpful and friendly.
They had my card and within a few minutes, i got it back.
The service is always absolutely top notch, specifically joe, who i seem to always have as my teller mid-day.
And whenever i've had any problems or questions, they are answered quickly and friendly.
I would not only recommend uwcu, but this branch.
Been with them since i started working about 8 years ago.
Love the friendly bankers and now both of my daughter's and husband have opened accounts with them.
Love the app so i don't have to go in to deposit checks
How can you not give this bank a 5-star?
It opens on sunday, most banks don't.
It extend their business hours mondays thru fridays, most banks don't.
Really enjoy banking with this bank, check them out.
This y attracts a professional crowd, which makes sense since it's in an uptown hi-rise.
I come here m-th, and mainly use the lap pool.
I go to this location a lot because it's close to my house.
The tellers are pleasant enough and always give my children dum dums.
They've never given me any trouble about deposits or withdrawals & i love their envelope free atms.
They'll accept coins as long as they're rolled and will give you the rolling papers to do it.
If you don't have enough to make a roll, they'll happily count them for you.
I love this place thus far!!
They have great customer service and remember who i am every single time.
That nowadays is as rare as a unicorn lol!!!
Over all i love it!!
2 thumbs up  if i had more i'd put more up ha
Great customer service at this location.
As soon as i walked in i was greeted and was asked if i needed any help.
I've been banking here since 2011.
I've moved multiple times since then to different states, but the shared branching has allowed me to stay with them.
I'm very happy i have.
I trust these people.
I live in california but sold my car to one of their customers.
I called to verify the cashier's check and got nancy.
She was super polite and helpful even though i'm not a customer.
I was nervous taking an out of state check for such a large amount, but i feel much better.
I always get great service here!
The staff is friendly and attentive!
They really make you feel at home!
Ponja was amazing and quick to help us resolve issues.
Very understanding of the situation and handled it efficiently.
Though i may not like the bank their service was faster than many of their other branches.
I brought back a shirt that was sitting in the back of my car for 6 mos.
I live in california but my son lives in scottsdale,az.
It was still tagged and i had the receipt.
The man that helped me did not hesitate for a moment and gave me a gift card for $60.
The full amount of the item.
Granted we spent over $900.
I believe he was the store manager.
If he was not he should be.
Old fashioned customer attention & service.
They need to train the staffs at "mens whse.
I usally walk out after after minutes of walking around.
This is where we come for all our important events.
This office is absolutely fabulous!
I had the pleasure of working with logan when i called to tell them i wanted to switch insurance companies.
Logans response time in a call or email was impeccable.
I went into the office to sign the papers and the whole team was genuinely kind and sincere.
Thanks for your help and great work team!
I have recommended you since and gladly will again!
This branch is the closest to where i work, and therefore the branch i use the most.
I've had to do multiple money orders/card replacements/account opening/account merging operations here and never had any problems.
I've been visiting them for years, and see the same friendly faces regularly.
I appreciate that, and i think it shows well.
Drive through banking/atm's as well as a 24/7 outdoor atm available.
Sending kudos to roberto borges the customer service manager (i don't know where he's located) !!!
I was on the brink of tears after being told something that apparently was misinformation.
I gave this poor man hell and he didn't deserve that.
Lol  thank you roberto for everything... you were amazing with a crazy lady on the phone.
I pray this gets to him.
I don't know   how the tellers put up with me !!
Went to midfirst bank today for the first time & met andrea hathaway who is the asst.
Go in and talk to them.
This bank has 5 star employees!
It can be tricky to get here if you work 9-5.
Marsha, pam and stacey greet all their regular customers by name when they walk in .
All 3 are very helpful, experienced and courteous employees.
Drive through is a quick in/out.
Look no further for an ins agent...larry and his staff are always so attentive to your ins needs.
Not only are they your ins agency they make you feel at home when you stop by or call in.
Hands down the best!
Quick, easy & great customer service.
Not my part of town so didn't know what to expect.
Someone greeted me at entry & directed me.
No line, there were more than enough tellers open.
I have been a member of this bank for a very long time.
I have been coming to this particular branch for a few years now.
The staff here are always very friendly and willing to help.
A few of them even recognize me and know me by name.
If you are looking for a bank to join, this one is definitely one that you should consider.
I've used this wells fargo for years and have always had prestigious service.
I've only ever had two problems with my accounts and they quickly fixed them.
Everyone is always extremely courteous and happy to help.
They are always on you're side and want what is best for you.
Thank you claudia for not only doing your job, but actually caring.
This bank is very convenient and close to my house.
He also gives my dogs treat and me a lollipop.
Definitely makes going to the bank a lot of easier.
Friendly and helpful staff.
Clean interior, not as nice as some of the other branches interior design but it's still a great bank :)
I love this bank!
They are like family at this point and i have cancelled my chase bank account.
I do ally banking at this location and they know me by name.
You can't get that kind of service at the larger banks.
I agree with amanda.
I've been with state farm over 25 yrs and with steve sears for over 10.
His staff is friendly, informed and professional.
And, yes, they do always remember us when we call.
Closed my account with wells fargo today, and opened one here at chase.
Jesus, helped us open a new account, and we couldn't be more please with his service.
The experience was refreshing!
We were not hassled, and not pressured into anything.
We will be back to open a joint account soon with you :)
The locker rooms are nice, clean and towel service is awesome.
This is my ymca now =)
The workers here are very helpful.
As an ex-californian with a cali acct, gives challenges now living in nevada.
I wanted to modify, so the associate gave me full and thorough options that i can pick from.
Thing about banks, (my 2 cents)they need to have good listening skills.
As well as articulate and clear explanations.
And smiles and eye contact.
And allowing me to leave satisfied with errands accomplished.
Going the extra lap in seeing how i'm really doing.
I hope all branches are smooth and awesome as this.
But i'll definitely be coming here in the future.
Would have a 5, because 99% of the employees here are phenomenal!
One person either has a bad day, stereotypes, doesn't like their job, etc and boy oh boy can you tell.
I don't know name names, "those" kind of people usually weed themselves out.
Relax,  it could be worse.
Okay, i am giving this location five stars but the actual bank three stars after my recent experience.
First, as many have already mentioned this branch is pretty nice as well as the employees.
You have to drill them to find out what the hell they are doing when it comes to posting transaction.
Whatever happened to midnight?
So anyways, let say you have instant pay/deposits like i do.
You are going to get hit with an nsf fee but not right away.
Remember, deposit is made, you have instsant pay baby!
So again, your mobile banking app says the deposit is made and you now have a positive balance, yay!
Wrong because sometime after 12pm central (10am az time) guess what?
You have a nice $37 nsf fee.
Its a scam and that is where all the nsf fees come from.
Banks are making billions of dollars off consumers with nsf fees.
No nsf fees ever!!!
Dana (bank manager) and the staff here are very helpful and know their stuff!
The staff at this branch is so amazing   they are smart, helpful, and take very very great care of me.
Special mention to tori who is brilliant!
I don't ever carry my card and i haven't memorized my account number, but it doesn't matter.
They are always happy to help!
This store is amazing.
We were in the store for about 2 hours and julie was patient, considerate, and most of all real.
She gave recommendations based on experience and even gave recommendations on which color to wear for each interview.
Thank you to the staff that gave input on our selections, and a special thank you to julie.
We will be back for the shirts that we did not get today!
Bank to rent tuxes for our wedding.
Rachel at the n scottsdale road location was very professional and ensured that everything went smoothly.
Everything was clean, in good condition, and fitted well.
We all looked great.
This ymca facility is pretty nice!
The staff is very nice and the areas are all quite clean and well maintained.
There is towel service which is always great (i hate laundry).
I'm not sure if it's the times i go in but there seems to never me a line inside.
Staff always greets me as i enter.
Drive thru atm is very conveniently located at the entrance of the property.
I feel very well taken care of here !
This branch of wells fargo is awesome.
Everyone is so nice, and they always have free coffee and bottled water.
Always someone to great you to help out.
And all the tellers are helpful and friendly.
When i have had some issues with my account they have always been happy to take care of it.
Outstanding customer service, knowledge, and management.
From the simple to the complex, wells fargo has the expertise.
Don't waste your time with other banks.
Even though large, wells fargo feels like a community bank.
I really only pop in here for the atm, i don't bank with chase because of their fees.
The atm is inside the bank,its very clean and air conditioned.
Ms emily was pretty attentive and helpful to required needs.
A very smooth experience and mr. stephen has replied with utmost prompt and experienced answers.
Jackie chiu one of the bank assistants at bmo smiled and came to help when i mentioned my difficulties.
He walked me through working the cash machine, which i patiently let him do.
The bank was actually closed but jackie gave me all the time i needed.
My card was reactivated.
If all the workers at this new bmo branch are like jackie, i would open an account immediately.
This branch is friendly, fast and seem to have a lot of regulars!
Really great banking experience.
Jonathan martinez was completely professional and accommodating to our request.
He assisted our organization in updating account information and was attentive to any questions we had.
Just left the bank and have nothing but positive feedback for tori wilson.
She was fantastic and helped with all my questions!
She had an appointment today with another person and i arrived as a walk-in.
The appointment arrived late and she took me in.
She has excellent customer service and was very patient.
If you to speak with a banker, please ask for tori!
This chase bank has very friendly and helpful staff members.
They always try to get you where you need to be quickly.
This branch has two drive-up atms!
Yes, efficiency for the masses.
I have yet to go inside, but the car experience is a good one.
Plenty of entrance and exits off south blvd.
The girls that work at this bank are very sweet.
I often go inside and avoid the drive up just to chat with them.
They always seem to make time for customers.
Brittany has helped me with my online banking and has shown me how to use it.
She's a real big help to me.
All of the girls are really very sweet they are my bank.
I enjoy banking because the service they give me is just really great.
I'd recommend this bank to anyone and everyone!
Britney helped me the other day and she was friendly and efficient!
Also, i didn't really have to wait at all, but then i went on slightly off hours.
The location is a lil tucked off the main road so don't miss it!
When i lived nearby, i would visit this location often.
Now, i rarely stop by this location, but happened to be in the area recently.
Return factor - 50%....would be higher if i lived nearby.
The entire staff is very friendly and helpful, and patient with advice and recommendations.
5-star staff and service!
Opening an account could not have been easier nor could it have been more pleasant.
Patrice was not only competent and friendly, but so helpful that she anticipated my concerns and questions.
I left this branch completely confident that i had chosen the right establishment.
Thank you miss patrice and the folks at cccu.
Nice feature to deposit cheques electronically with their iphone app.
And people are very nice.
Down side is poor integration of their mastercard credit card with their online web interface.
Need to go to a mediocre different site which is rather poor ux.
This bank is wonderful!
Sean signed me and my boyfriend up for a few accounts and he was just great.
Very helpful and answered all our questions i details.
He even did a follow up call a few days later to make sure our accounts were going okay.
I have been in this bank 3 times since i got an account and everytime was a fantastic experience.
Everyone was friendly and treated me like a loyal customer!
I come here at least once a week & the staff is always friendly.
Cory is one of the nicest tellers i have ever come across.
Very happy with this bank & lucky its only a minute away :)
Very helpful and responsive staff.
Their customer service is top notch.
Nice branch with helpful employees.
What makes compass any better than any other bank?
They refund other banks atm fees!
How cool is that?
No paperwork or anything!
I've always had great customer service at this location and staff are always friendly and ready to help.
If you have the chance to deal with sorina, do it!
She's also a notary in illinois and notarized a couple of things we needed while we were at her desk.
Seriously, i almost never think of a bank as "my bank"...
Just wonderful customer service.
I prefer ck ymca to dowd during the week.
For one thing, it's less crowded.
I also feel that people are a bit more "real" at ck...
I chose this bank based on the great reviews and i have not been disappointed.
I'm so happy i chose pinnacle bank.
Clerks are polite but also efficient & quick in what they do.
Never had a problem.
Love banking with chase, especially this location.
The bankers and tellers are super friendly and very knowledgeable.
I switched from another office and so glad i did.
The absolute best customer service.
Such a happy staff.
Love banking at this branch!
Stolen, what a feeling!!
I went right from the gas station to the national bank on york st.
When she returned, she asked me a lot of questions for security, which i loved...
Lourdes was one of the best customer service experiences i have ever had in toronto.
Simply the best credit union i have ever belonged to.
Their online site is excellent...very easy to navigate.
Do yourself a favor...dump your cold, greedy bank and become a member.
You won't regret it.
He is so kind and helpful, and he truly goes above and beyond for his clients.
I went to this location to cash my check and was delighted by how kindly the staff treated me.
Never was i ever so happy to be a wells fargo customer.
I have a seen a lot of negative reviews for this bank and wanted to give it a fair rating.
I don't think a bank should get one star because someone didn't get 5000 in 100 dollar bills.
What makes a bank is how they treat their customers overall.
I have never had an issue with this bank and they have always been kind to me.
Deer valley credit union in glendale is a wonderful banking branch.
They are all knowledgeable and never fall short on demonstrating superb customer service skills.
This is a very good bank branch, folks.
I have really started to love coming to this gym for a quick lunchtime workout!!
The gym is laid out fairly nicely with a cardio area and weight area separated by a basketball court.
Prices are very reasonable.
-the quick fit room off the track- great for a quick workout away from others.
-weight area- for being a small area, they have a good amount of stuff.
I think there are about 4 unassisted squat stands/bars, which is alot for this size gym.
This place keeps getting better and better.
I just wish it was a little less crowded and they'd fix the mirrors.
Place needs to move kettlebells out of the small training session room and put some on the floor.
This bank has a friendly and upbeat vibe.
When you walk in, you are greeted by the tellers who are very friendly.
The most important part is that the service is very quick (which i really appreciate when i'm in a hurry).
This is the main branch of first credit union.
It's a bit bigger than most of the others.
But it's still the credit union.
Check my reviews of the others, this one is the same.
Banks suck, credit unions rock.
I use banks as little as possible, preferring instead the no-hassle credit union environment.
As i've said before, they have no shareholders.
They are responsible to their members.
Banks only care about the quarterly report to their shareholders, and they make all those profits off of you!
Best community bank in town!
Great management and staff!
Voted #1 community bank in arizona 3 years in a row, by ranking arizona.
I come in with cash and deposit it into an account.
Truth be told, the nature of such a transaction actually fits the décor of the place.
This is a well-preserved bank with a retro-style foyer and banking area.
The business account people like me are ushered into the back area and queue up between our own velvet ropes.
She is patient,  and very knowledgeable, she is a wonderful asset to your company.
Thank you ms. alisha, for your ki d assistance.
Very close to my home.
Customer service is excellent.
Drive up and atm available 24 hour.
I recently opened a checking and savings account here and i was teamed up with kristen wright.
Fast drive-thru window, great location, fast service and clean lobby.
Security guard on the outside of the branch daily during business hours.
I use this branch often.
Today i had to go inside and use a live teller.
The line was short and she was very friendly and pleasant.
I was 3rd in line when i arrived and was in/out in 5 minutes.
For my financial sake....i hope so!
I recently opened my membership at dvcu and have never had a better experience at any other financial institution.
I've had wells fargo as a kid growing up because i had a couple family members who worked there.
I also banked at chase, bofa, us bank and a couple of other small credit unions.
Dvcu is honestly hands down the best experience i've had with banking so far.
The staff is super friendly and helpful.
I would recommend dvcu to anyone who is tired of the big banks.
Credit unions are not for profit but will benefit its members!
Jm went out of his way to provide excellent customer service.
He is helpful, friendly, and easy to get in touch with over email or phone.
Jm worked hard to secure the best mortgage rate.
I would definitely use dominion lending centres again in the future.
Guys, i'm going to share a not-so-secret with you and hope that it doesn't catch on and ruin the awesomeness.
You know what's great?
Walking into a banking establishment and having the tellers know your name!
Your mileage may vary, but i love these guys.
This branch is fantastic.
All the employees are friendly and knowledgeable.
I was banking at wells fargo and thank the lord i found this gem!!!
The costumer service is amazing and there isn't surprise fees you'll see pulled from your account every month.
If you are thinking about switching i highly recommend this bank!!
They're quite courteous at this location.
The atm is easily accessible.
Never a long wait.
I'm in here once a week and they are always kind and helpful!
Jeremiah is usually who helps me and he's particularly professional as well as friendly.
I've always had a pleasant experience at this wells fargo.
The tellers are all courteous and polite.
They handle my transactions without issues and always wish me a pleasant day.
I've become somewhat of a regular at this location as my office is just down the street.
They greet me by name and always offer assistance if needed.
For a big bank they don't make me feel like number.
In a day when most of our bank transactions are electronic, who cares about bank branches, right?
The staff here is excellent.
They have a person dedicated to greeting you and allocating someone to your needs.
We have our safe deposit box here, and we can always get at it within 5 minutes.
They literally rush to find someone with keys.
This was one of the simplest and most pleasant experiences i've had in my week of living here.
I'm very happy to have found this credit union.
Everyone is like family and always there to help, i could not feel more supported as an employee.
Its really nice to work somewhere where everyone is so happy and nice.
I have done all my banking here for years.
All others fail in comparison.
Nfcu has intelligent, professional, knowledgable and courteous staff.
If you qualify for an account here and do not open one you are only hurting yourself.
I called ahead of time to ask what i needed to bring in to get a checking account.
I made an apt with him that day.
It was fast and easy!
He was very friendly and went over everything with me.
The place has a great location and the inside was very clean!
I'm not a vet, but i have a joint account here.
I rarely need to go in person, but when i have, staff have been prompt and professional.
Account maintenance is easy and everything's accessible online.
The parking lot is usually a disaster, which is another reason i usually avoid going in person.
Joe, logan and carlos are the best.
The customer service here is off the charts, these guys are friendly, professional and truly care about you.
I've never had a problem, i've never had trouble reaching them and they continue to exceed my expectations.
Thank you joe, logan and carlos!
You guys deserve a raise :)
Just wanted more cash for tips and the like.
This chase was easy to find and not far from the main strip.
Easy parking lot to get in and out of and up-close parking.
Atms in a front area but we went into the branch and were greeted by two friendly employees.
I made some coffee while husband completed the financial transaction stuff.
And then in only a few minutes, we were off for more adventures with money in our pockets again.
I have been insured with shaine stevenson from the time he opened his first office nearly a decade ago.
His staff does everything possible to provide me with maximal coverage at a minimal price.
Went in and the teller had a nice smile.
Took care of my service and bid me a happy easter.
Nice and courteous with fast service.
I'm a first time home buyer and my realtor recommended home street loan to me .
They didn't mind that i asked 100 questions probably the same one over and over again.
I think this company is awesome.
Everyone should try it i didn't have any problems at all.
You guys are great
There are plenty of cardio and weight machines, free weights, a pool, two basketball courts, and an indoor track.
The facility is very clean and well maintained, and the staff and group exercise instructors are always pleasant and helpful.
A couple of tips before heading to the gym: 1.
Nice, quiet, and clean bank.
What else can you ask for in a busy city like vegas?
I love this bank.
Glad they have so many locations, especially finding them in the wal-marts.
This branch isn't favorite but i don't mind stopping in to take care of business
This is one of my local scotiabanks.
It's with in walking distance from my office and house, the location is clean and the staff are friendly.
They are very efficient, and very helpful.
I'll agree with chris p - the hours are not great, but no bank has good hours these days.
I will admit, i hate that they are not open on saturdays and sundays.
All in all a great bank....
Went in saturday to open an account and were greeted by blake as soon as we walked in.
Knowledgeable and personable, blake made the experience fun and memorable!
Got us all set up and made us feel at home.
We walked out feeling like we had been coming here for years!
Great experience, great location for us, and plenty of branch and atm locations for convenience.
Our new favorite home-town bank!
Brittany was awesome today!
Got me what i needed and fast on my lunch break!
So i was out in the greater phoenix area and stayed out here in surprise!
So what were we to do but head over to the bank.
Well surprise surprise... arizona still has drive up tellers... that kicks azz!
I miss these in california.
Pro tip: drive thru, walk in, or atms who could ask for more?
Well we had a quick n easy trip to this branch.
Friendly, lots of ac inside i would imagine (we didn't go in), easy to navigate drive through lanes.
What more do you need?
How about a quick n easy transaction and we were in and out and didn't have to leave the car.
Talk about nice and wonderfully easy.
Great quickie trip to the bank.
I wish that we had the drive through tellers in california still...
This branch is a really neat building, located on the nw corner of dysart and mcdowell.
The staff is really friendly, and nice, very helpful.
My new dsfcu location.
The people here we're all really nice.
It's a good looking location as well.
The only thing is that if you map it from here, it won't take you right to the location.
It's a little off, the branch is right by la fitness
As a member of nfcu since 1991, i have seen it evolve into a world class banking institution.
With their online banking, phone service, bill pay and e-deposit.
I find i no longer need to go to their branch for my banking needs.
Their customer service is also excellent and nfcu is known for their generous credit lines and low interest rates.
If you qualify, i highly recommend nfcu for all  your banking needs.
I go here even though they constantly take my money.
Oh well, haters gotta hate.
;-)  seriously tho, shoutout for the puppies debit card!
Candi is the best and most helpful person there.
I just found out she left jos a banks to go work at infinity selling new cars.
I'm sure she will be number one there as she was for three years at jos a banks.
Full service inside safeway anything you need done they can do.
Friendly service top notch.
I stopped by today to see if i could get a couple of nsf fees removed.
I felt very welcomed and the customer service was top notch.
The banker addressed all my concerns.
I've enjoyed banking specifically with this wells fargo branch location for over a decade.
The staff is trained well and consistently resourceful and courteous.
They've assisted in transferring, linking and renaming our accounts.
The tellers are efficient with shortening a waiting line.
Overall if you are looking for a reliable place to stash your funds, come here.
I was greeted at the door by an friendly employee who directed me to a teller for my transaction.
They also had what appeared to be a complimentary hot coffee station by the door as well.
That was a nice touch.
I think she was finished crediting my account within 90 seconds.
So why this y?
This also means the crowds are manageable and people tend to know the other people around.
I don't find this so much at the dowd, for example.
The friendly aires here are just a little more appealing both for motivational and enjoyment of the visit purposes.
Second, the cardio and weight equipment is well-maintained and logically laid out.
When you are on a schedule, this helps.
Third, everything you want is here in one place.
Group ex classes, a pool, an indoor track, personal training and basketball half court.
Lunchtime tends to be busiest, but the early morning crowd gets decently sized too.
The after work rush is much more subdued lately, no real idea why.
Amazing how things empty out then.
The times do not apply on the weekends, though i am sure the gym here is closed completely on sundays.
Whatever you do, just make sure you stamp your parking ticket with the y stamp at the entrance.
The parking deck attendants have little mercy for those who do not follow the restrictions.
State farm in general has always been imo the best agency around.
Take it one step farther and get the best agent they have.
She's got a lot of experience and loves what she does.
I highly recommend her and state farm.
Nice, clean, fast, and always pleasant.
Have been using this branch for years and i can't think of a single negative.
The drive through atm is not great for depositing checks but that serves me right for being lazy.
Ralph (personal banker) thew a boomerang with me...took a negative and slashed it to a glorious positive.
Recently had a charge that blew a flurry into my checking account.
To simplify the matter, he delivered me from potential stress and an farewell.
They have drive through and walk up atms.
This branch is also remodeled and support all bank products such as investment and mortgage.
Great customer service everytime i come into this location as well.
I just relocated to scottsdale and needed to open a new bank account.
I sat with patricia who was so warm and kind.
I'm happy with the whole process; super easy and seamless.
I'm happy to be a part of this local bank!
This is my local branch that i normally do business at.
Until today, i had the pleasure of working with chad b to resolve a small discrepancy.
Super friendly, very helpful and very professional.
He is a great addition to the bank
This is a very friendly banking center.
The tellers and bankers are all very helpful and eager to help.
I noticed on their website today that they are offering 100% home financing.
Becky answered the phone when i called (740-3542) and answered every one of my questions about this product.
We have actual choices now!
Special thank you to manager kevin k. for taking awesome care of me today!
You have gone above and beyond and im very grateful!
Keep up the great head of hair you are blessed with :)
There isn't enough space in this review to cover all the great things i have to say about pinnacle.
We worked with greg thorell to buy our first home through pinnacle.
They are on top of every step of the process and are always willing to answer questions.
We locked in early at an incredible rate and couldn't be happier with the outcome.
I recently visited this facility visiting charlotte, nc.
The address on the outside of the building says something totally different, and unrelated to '301' 'college' or 'st'.
But, after calling the staff help me via telephone to find their location.
I was very impressed with the facility and its cleanliness.
I also took the body pump class with sue m. and another young lady.
The class was great and i'd suggest others to take it as well.
Dwayne is a joy to work with!
Honest, trustworthy and professional.
Everything you could ever ask for in an insurance agent.
There isn't a better bank staff.
They are extremely happy, inviting and helpful.
