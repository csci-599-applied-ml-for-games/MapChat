I have been to Lee Lee International Supermarket in Chandler many times, but I never noticed this little gem next to it until a couple years ago. Boba Tea House has serving up some of the best boba tea in the Valley long before it became a big thing. They have a fantastic array of flavors and drink choices to choose like fruit slushes, snow, milk tea, pudding, mango jelly, coffee jelly, etc. They even have snacks like popcorn chicken, fried tofu, and fries. The staff is super friendly and the prices are reasonable. I still laugh at my friends who have no idea what Boba Tea is or are too afraid to suck up one of those chewy ball things. LOL. In case you didn't know, Boba Tea is a flavored tea (usually with milk) to which chewy tapioca balls or fruit jellies are added. I think they are super delicious. Today I got the Blueberry Milk Boba Tea and it made for the perfect snack in the middle of my day. Another favorite of my mine is the honeydew milk tea."}

Not only was the nasty woman who served me avoiding any type of pleasantry but she was yelling across two other workers and a line of patrons asking what I wanted from the other end of the shop. When I asked the server for lettuce, onion and roasted red peppers on my sandwich she quite literally moaned very loud and followed it with yelling 'ughhhhh god help me!' Before adding my toppings to my turkey sandwich. When one of the other servers asked us if our food was for 'here or to go' the original server says aloudly 'to-go hopefully!!!' Wtf... I'd love to know who this terrible human being thinks she is! I found my jaw on the floor more than once, wondered why she thought I was such a headache, and my friend and I decided right there that we would NEVER return nor would we let this review go untold to everyone we know!! I feel the owners somehow have to be to blame! How the hell do you allow someone so miserable represent your livelihood? You don't expect livelihood for very much longer, that's how.

I got the Lemon Raspberry and the Coconut, as well as a Key Lime cake pop.  I tried the cake pop first.  It was gummy tasting and neon green.  I have been to Key West and I never saw a neon green key lime.  Then I took a bite out of the coconut one.  The cake per se was not bad, however the frosting tasted like oil.  Not appetizing.  So, I closed the little container and tried the Lemon Raspberry.  I guess I have been spoiled by other cupcakes in town.  Again, the neon yellow color for the cake.  Where do they get these citrus. (see picture)  The cake tasted like the ones from the grocery store.  I ended up throwing them in my garbage, making sure to smoosh it down, in case I had a Miranda moment (only if you have watched Sex and the City you will get this).

We saw this beautiful white 3 tiered pyramid shaped cake in a then really big Julia Robert's movie and really wanted that one. We went in to Baker Wee to see if they could make it. The owners were not there and we were told by the manager lady we spoke to that she will be the one making the cake anyway. She saw the movie too and knew exactly what cake we were asking for. We even made a 2D drawing of it, she wrote down her notes and took the order. She said she will rent the movie so she can take one more look at it before she makes it. Fast forward to our wedding day....we arrived at the restaurant where our dinner reception was and for the first time we got to see our cake. WOW! We almost fainted. I should include pictures because there's just no way to describe how ugly it was. The original agreement in size was a 12' x 12' square and 10-12' tall, like I said pyramid. We got an 8' square base, next layer 6' base and the top layer 4' base and the whole cake was 2 feet tall! It looked like a Chinese pagoda. The layers were on 4' tall sticks. And the best part: it was airbrushed with brown color like marble and had brown 1/2' diameter ball on the top.. -   Turned out, the owner (who has never seen the movie - or apparently a pyramid before ) ended up making the cake, never called us or the manager lady with questions, just tried to figure it out from the her notes. This was her understanding of it.  We were so embarrassed all night, everyone kept asking what the cake was supposed to be? We just kept saying: a snow white pyramid. Next morning we drove down to the bakery, furious. She said she will not refund the $300 we spent on it because she worked on it all day and she did her best. She said she was sorry and we can have a basic cake ($30 value) for free. We did get that cake a few week later for a birthday and never ever returned to Baker Wee again. It's very sad how greatly it impacted our special day. We should have demanded a refund but we gave up on the arguing back and fourth - it didn't change anything. After all we didn't want the money, we wanted the cake. So anyway, I would not recommend them if they were the last bakery, I  would rather make a homemade cake. I also wish there was a way to choose 0 stars on this on."}

Food: You go and order at the counter and then sit and they will bring it to you. The woman at the counter was very friendly and helped us making our decisions. They have a wide variety of items including ice cream, coffee, desserts, salads, sandwiches, breakfast, tea, etc. Very reasonably priced menu! I got the tuna melt, it was just ok. The tuna salad was a bit too over dressed for my liking. It felt gluttonous with all the mayonnaise and I think there was mustard in there maybe? It came with a side and I chose coleslaw, it felt kind of like the kind you would buy in a big jar at sam's club, not my favorite but others like their sides so maybe I'll try something else next time. The others liked the chips and the macaroni salad. Chicken salad on the croissant had similar opinions on the tuna that it was thick and over dressed but the croissant was toasted and good.

As we finished up our main course our sweet crepe came out.  I was surprised how full I was from the one savory crepe, but I made room for my half of a simple bruleed crepe with nuts.

If you're at Fashion Square and craving a gluten free treat, do yourself a favor and go to the Macaroon place. I'm disappointed, especially considering the cupcake was $5 after tax. The one star is for gluten free cupcakes only, as I have not (and cannot) try a regular one."}

{"bus_id":"zPAMOTc_VEfgPxseUtWw-w", "text":"Nestled in what is (for now) a relatively sleepy corner of Downtown, Urban Bodega (aka URBO) feels like something of a throwback to some of the small convenience stores I used to see line the Roosevelt Row neighborhood.  Back when Downtown was still a neighborhood where only the most diehard entrepreneurs dared to tread, you could find one of these small neighborhood shops selling everything from wine and beer, to snacks, to cooking essentials, and even a few household cleaning items.  The relatively new Pure Fillmore apartment complex is currently the first of what will undoubtedly be many new apartment and condo complexes lining 7th Avenue in Downtown.  But for now, the nearest full sized grocery store requires a car.  All the more reason URBO's location makes sense.  You'll find URBO on the bottom floor of the Pure Fillmore Apartments on Fillmore Street just east of 7th Avenue.  The brainchild of DeSoto Central Market alum Shawn Connelly, you enter here through the front patio area (where there's seating for eight by the way).  Inside, its a whole lot of stuff mixed into a small space.  Behind the counter, you can get coffee, tea, or even a sandwich made on the spot.  In front of the counter, it's essentially a small independent convenience store with many of the things you'd expect.  Candy bars, meds, condiments, snacks, microwavable items, beer, wine, soda, as well as odds and ends like tissue paper, shampoo, and storage bags.  I can well imagine some Downtown college students living in the apartments upstairs too hung over or too tired to drive two miles to Safeway and instead opting for a stop here.  For my first stop here on a Saturday morning, I opted to get a quick morning pick me up.  A tea and a sandwich.  I got their Salted Caramel Iced Tea (also available hot) and their Turkey Sausage Egg & Cheese sandwich on an english muffin.  Both made to order.  Total cost including tax: $10.  Now to be fair, they prepared the sandwich in part using a microwave so we're not talking gourmet here.  Still, the sandwich hit the spot and the sausage in particular was very tasty.  I was also very happy with the tea.  Almost tasted like a southern style sweet tea of sorts with those caramel accents.  A solid breakfast.  So there you have it.  A locally owned business filling a need in an emerging neighborhood.  Nothing pretentious.  Just a good, straight forward, progressive independent convenience store.  Even if you don't live in this quiet corner of Downtown, its worth a look.  Or a sip and bite and it was in my case."}

My review is based solely on these, as we did not try the desserts or anything else. Some of the bagels seemed 'fresher' than others, and if you've ever had a NYC bagel before 8am, you know the expectations I have. I also feel like the bagels were kinda skinny, and the holes were big. I'm used to really fat, chewy but pillowy ones. Sigh.  But it really pains me to give anything lower than 4 stars, as they have a lot of traditional Jewish/NYC deli delicacies, which you really don't see out here in LV. If that is your thing, you really should check it out! The rye bread with caraway seeds looked good. The dessert section also piqued my interest. Please don't get a black & white cookie - Hell will freeze over before anyone ever likes those, trust me.  The shop is located in the weirdest shopping complex - it feels like a dr's office belongs here. Inside, it was pretty poppin' (it was Sunday), but the line wasn't bad.   All in all, I will be back again to try more."}

First of all, I am not sure if this is country wide, but they charge 70c CAD to add a few drops of soymilk to some cold brew iced coffee, which is free in the US.  Additionally, their cold brew did not have the smooth flavor of the cold brew I am used to at Starbucks.  Third, mobile ordering doesn't appear to be functioning for this store or in Canada (this may be an app limitation and not specific to this location). On a good note, the bagel was edible and they had some type of guacamole avocado spread in a container which was better than I was expecting.  Update: I did write to corporate on the fact that I was charged money to put a few drops of soy milk in my cold brew and they did confirm that this is not a correct practice to charge for tiny amount of soy milk in iced coffee."}

Situated in the corner of a large strip mall on Fort Apache, I was across the street for a lash appointment and decided to make a pit stop at Hobby Lobby. Felt parched and walked into Pop thinking it was a bubble tea joint, nope definitely not that - as the name implies it's pop for my midwesterners. Not just any old pop, speciality drinks made with pop.   Such a simple concept honestly, but very well thought out and executed. I'm not much of a pop drinker, after all I counsel against it. But every once in a while I'll give myself the option, luckily it's not something I crave. Initially it was the feeling that I had walked into the place assuming it was something else but felt odd walking out. I got to looking at the menu and looking back outside at the sun beaming down and thought I'd give it a whirl. Have to say, I will be back!  Soda is used as a base ingredient to craft a drink. So if you create your own you choose a size, pick your soda (or tea for my healthies), pick your add ins. I appreciate that they have an XS size which for me was truly a S. Great for portion control people! Then they have a menu with fool proof recipes created for us. I chose the Jojo because I enjoy Dr. Pepper and substituted the coconut cream for vanilla cream. Yum! They also have a secret menu (see picture - white) of drink creations and needless to say I was overwhelmed with options. Finally, they have a foods fo pair alongside your beverages, popcorn and cookies. A kids menu per say - an XXS drink (12 oz) with kid size popcorn. Also, got beverages, coffee/hot chocolate.   Aside from my beverage being delicious, I appreciated the service. It's a very simple concept so to speak, so the fact that the employee took his time to talk me through the menu was above and beyond. The pricing was right! The shop has ample seating, parking. You get a stamp card for return visits. I wasn't told explicitly about a guarantee but I'm sure my drink would've been remade had I not liked it.   I was told they have another location, Silverado Ranch. Will most definitely be going back and recommending on a hot, hot day!"}

The next few times I visited during busier times such as the weekend was not the same. But it was also a different server.  The service depends on who is working... it's very inconsistent.   In terms of offerings, most of the drinks are just like majority of other bubble tea chains. The one thing that makes coco unique to me is their sago topping. So if I felt like drinking sago on the go then I'll drop by Coco for a drink. But otherwise, there are plenty of alternative bubble tea chains around. In order to stay competitive, Coco should provide consistent good customer service or else I probably won't return."}

It's been open almost a year and I figured the kinks would be worked out but no. Every single time, every drink is always wrong. I've tried all my favorites and I've traded them in for something else or had them 'fix' it. I started drinking DB 4 years ago because of the friendly-ness and consistency with their drinks. EVERY time this stand makes the wrong drink they respond some stands make it different. Odd since I've been to grey hawk, Scottsdale, Glendale/51 and 7th st location the exact same drink and it tastes just fine. They even tried to tell me my favorite stand doesn't have a frozen rebel machine and that's why. No they do and it's better.

{"bus_id":"X8AGCsJHw-GuTqkzy2J3cg", "text":"Finally! This review is LONG overdue - during the last year or so working downtown has given me multiple chances to eat at the beloved Bluebird Kitchen. I've come here for made-to-order breakfasts and lunches alike, and nothing has disappointed.   Their enormous breakfast sandwiches and fresh fruit smoothies leave me feeling full and satisfied, moreso than other places with similar breakfast options; the potato, sausage, egg and goat cheese laden frittata sandwich is a definite favorite. And their lunches are also a wonderful and tasty option should I forget to bring something to work that day. Their roast beef and Cuban sandwiches have been my favorites so far.  If you're the type who likes seasonal items, Bluebird offers monthly smoothies and sandwiches as an addition to the standard menu. I tried their special vegetarian sandwich from last summer (with fried green tomato, grapefruit & cabbage coleslaw) - I admittedly remember that sandwich being on the bitter side, more so than I expected as someone who likes both green tomatoes and grapefruit. It wasn't bad though, and it was certainly a unique flavor profile compared to what I typically find for a quicker downtown lunchtime option.  It's definitely safe to say that this place has knocked it out of the park and made my taste buds very happy time and time again. And that's just considering their main meals - the amazing desserts elevate your meal options to an entirely different level. They're good. They're really good. You should go buy one of them in addition to a sandwich. And oh: this review is based on my limited perusing of the menu - I have yet to try their biscuits, granola, quiche, bread pudding, and salads.  I know getting to Bluebird before they close can be a chore if you're not nearby, but they're worth it. Stop in and enjoy!"}

There was a young lady running the register, and a manager with headset delegating tasks to the staff visible from my view point.  The manager walked past me numerous times, hyper focused on bags and monitors and never once glanced at me to make eye contact.  At no point did he even acknowledge my presence.  After 8 minutes of standing there, I finally locked on and said HEY, is the ubereats order ready yet?    His response to me was 'You should have spoken up, I can't read your mind'.  This response is the most unprofessional and rude interaction I have ever had at any restaurant while doing deliveries.  This man has clearly no sense of customer service, and the fact that he is a supervisor, with an entire staff of employees within earshot, is a galactic worry.  This is whom they are taking their cues from.    So, I will speak up.  Greeting customers and making eye contact with them is the very basic first steps to customer service, across all chains and brands and industries.  And customer service is the business you are in, Mr. Manager.  Your deluded belief that customers should scream at the top of their lungs to get your attention is ridiculous, especially as you've closed yourself off to all interaction by talking loudly in your headset, fidgeting with bags and monitors, and basically ignoring everything human in site.  Don't you think that would intimidate people and make them second guess approaching you?  I have the answer, and the answer is yes.    I will never again do a food delivery at this location.  I can guarantee you I am not the only one, because often times I am pinged from 10 miles away from this restaurant to do a delivery.  Really?

It may be difficult to get soy milk to the proper consistency, but there wasn't even an attempt here. The result was a mediocre beverage on par with something I could've gotten at any coffee chain (e.g. Espresso Royale, Starbucks, etc).

SCTH shares a space with with an art gallery and leather works manufacturing space. SCTH has a large window front facing the road (like Lola's) where you can perch and ponder passing traffic and gaze at the Phx downtown skyline, to include the Valley Ho. (Matt's Big Breakfast's FORMER location had a similar such lovely view...no longer.) SCTH carries baked goods from a favorite local bakery and each time I visit, other patrons make a point of extolling the degree to which they enjoy their own purchase.  Today I had a Cortado. My first Cortado ever was at the (former) Mud Dauber, now known as Demi. I enjoyed my sup. The servers here are matter of fact and prompt. The dairy is not readily available and must be requested."}

{"bus_id":"LW21U6m6axC2lCLYc0fFSA", "text":"EDIT:  I heard that some improvements had been made, so I went back and gave it another try.  This time, it was fabulous.  The cakes were moist, tender, and really tasty.  Prices still high, but this time it seemed worth it.  They have lowered the prices for a dozen cupcakes and dropped the box charge.  They also took cereal off the menu.  Minus 1 star because of the prices and because the gelato that comes with the $6 pairing wasn't that great.  The serving was also really small.  I'll skip the gelato and stick with a cupcake and a nice glass of milk when I go back.  I'd also prefer a sweeter, less greasy frosting, but that's a personal taste thing and It's probably not fair to fault them for my personal preference.  Overall, I was very impressed with the changes.  It made for a really nice evening to sit at the outdoor bar and enjoy a great cupcake on a warm spring evening, and I look forward to doing so again soon.  ******* I REALLY wanted to love this place.  I went in a few days after they opened and was disappointed to see that they are very overpriced.  But I didn't let that get me down.  I figured the prices must be reflective of the quality, and I got ready to sample what I expected would be some phenomenal cupcakes.    To my dismay, these expensive cupcakes are really not that good.  The few I brought home for everyone to sample were extremely dry and bland.  The texture reminded me of the free hunk of cake you get for your birthday at cheesy chain restaurants.  I'd had very high hopes for the salted caramel, but there was no hint of salt and the caramel element tasted like sugar that had been burnt, not caramelized.  The Red Velvet had a hint of cream cheese flavor in the frosting, but wasn't very sweet and had no chocolate flavor.  The high point was the strawberry balsamic, which was a nice combination of flavors but, like the others, very poorly executed.  It was really just a plain, dry, flavorless cupcake with some pretty decent strawberry frosting (which I actually liked very much) and a drizzle of thick vinegar.  Overall though, I'm sorry to report that  I've had better cupcakes from a box.  Speaking of boxes, if you want one to carry your cupcakes home in, It'll cost you $1.  With as much as they're charging for the cupcakes, you'd think they'd give you something to carry them home in.  Nope.  That's extra.  Insult to injury, if you will.  I'm inclined to give them the benefit of the doubt and try it again in a few months to give them a chance to get into the swing of things and, with any luck, turn out a better cupcake.  My hope is that the strawberry balsamic frosting is an indicator of a potential that they will reach once they get past the first few weeks.  Unfortunately, I don't know that they'll be around in a few months and I'm also not sure that I'd be willing to pay their insane prices even if the cupcakes were to improve substantially."}

I wanna start out by saying I live in China town, it's not the closest dessert place for me. Now on to the lovely things I've tried.  Get Loopy Macaron- this pretty cookie tasted as awesome as it looked. It was a fruit loop topped macaron filled with loopy vodka spiked butter cream.  Mocha Macaron- my favorite yet. It had a coffee and chocolate filling with a surprise crunch inside. Holy cow it was amazing.  Chocolate tart- tart crust filled with rich chocolate pot de creme topped with a chocolate ganache and salt flakes. I liked this dessert better at room temp. Caramel apple- I could live the rest of my life off of the caramel apples. The caramel was amazing and I detected a little salt which I loooooved.  Tiramisu cup - hubby's favorite dessert. Theirs is very tasty.  Marscapone cake- this cake was FULL of flavor and texture.  Strawberry champagne macaron- macaron filled with a champagne butter cream and a strawberry jelly. Sooooooo yummy.  Reeses chocolate peanut butter macaron- my least fave macaron. It wasn't bad but I wouldn't order it again.  French press coffee- they use lavaza so you know it's amazing.

There were no other customers in the place ---- the name of the game is to get people in and out. ESPECIALLY DOWNTOWN!!  2. Generosity of the ingredients.  The roast beef sandwich was all bread and very little meat.  I don't mind paying $9 for a sandwich, but it better be good and fill me up. They had only one or two measly slices of roast beef.  For these two reasons, I won't be going back any time soon!"}

Hob Nobs reminded me of something I'd find in Sonoma County but without the feeling that anybody was looking down their nose at me or the hippy serving me hadn't washed their hair since they lived in the haight-ashbury district in the 70's.   The staff was nice, cleanly, knowledgeable of the ingredients (all the sauces & mayo are made from scratch), and were smart enough to get my order right.  That's a HUGE plus.     I had never been here when it was the Willo House so I have no reference to the extent of the remodeling but - as it is now - the interior is very nice with beautiful wood floors, fun paint colors on the walls, artwork everywhere featuring local artists, and several different rooms all with a different feel where you can hide & chill, be amoung people, or even seat 8 or 10 and hold a meeting.  I'm with Kenny B... I could sit here for hours and check out the eye-candy.  I had a spinach salad with chicken, mandarin oranges, and candied pecans.  It was a good salad - my only complaint was that the chicken on the salad was actually chicken salad.  I was expecting grilled chicken (no mayo) but it was still very yummy.  My b/f had a spicy chicken salad sandwich which - to me - was too spicy but the sweet little side of cole-slaw contrasted the fire and cooled it down a bit.  I probably wouldn't order it again... but the selection of sandwiches drew my attention enough to already have picked out my 'next time I'm gonna have...'  So yes, for me... there will be a next time.  However, I'm giving it a 4 because I agree with most reviewers... it's a bit overpriced.  It was $22 for lunch for 2 people (a salad, a sandwich, and 2 drinks).  It's fine for once-in-a-while lunches but too high to be a regular lunch resource.    I know it's odd for a soda-fountain to be found in a coffee house but let's face it... Most coffee houses serve coffee & specialty drinks (along with a semi-fresh bagel or scone or biscotti...).  Hob Nobs is not *just* a coffee house.  The food here was well planned and prepared... not just an after-thought.  It's really more of a cafe / house than a coffee house."}

I come here to get a few things to get a few things I like, because I know them and even though it's pricey, I feel it's okay especially when I feel homesick. So they do get the few people from the French community like me who suck it up and pay the extra. But if they are looking for a wider clientele, they should really try another strategy.

FOCUS. get off yelp, and get to work!!!!!  *note: for those who live north of mcdowell, you have to go one block south of mcdowell and use that to get around to 3rd ave which is a one way street going north.  the parking lot on the southwest corner is open to hob nobs customers as well as the parking lot directly behind it."}

You've found it!  If you're looking for a place to get consistent costumer service? Not so much.  I live right around the corner from Thieves, so I want to love it so bad.  It's the closest coffee shop to my house and, like I said, has great fair trade coffee. But Thieves keeps inconsistent hours and the barristas (owner included) seem uninterested in serving you.  Which, attitude aside, just makes everything take longer.  Here's my anecdotal evidence: The first time I went to Thieves, when I got there, there was no one behind the counter.  I'd heard mixed reviews about getting served, so I thought I'd do an experiment and see how long it took.  After standing around for 7 minutes (and contemplating grabbing the cash register or one of those tasty croissants and making a run for it) a gentlemen who I now recognize as the owner reappeared (from the basement? outside? it was unclear.)  He moseyed over the counter where I was standing and took some time getting set up before looking up and saying, 'What can I get you?'   No 'Have you been waiting long?' or 'Sorry about that, I had to go and deal with an invasion of panthers downstairs!' or another plausible explanation.  I ordered my coffee, it was delicious.  And this has been the kind of experience I have come to expect from Thieves."}

The food here tastes healthy and fresh.  The hollandaise sauce on the benny had a nice lemony taste to it and it's a welcome change considering some place's poached eggs taste like vinegar.  Portions are big, imho, and both times I had items on the plate that I couldn't finish.  Prices could be a couple of dollars lower (It's $14 for a two-egg, peameal bacon benny and homefries) but considering that it's in a more low traffic area, it seems reasonable for a neighbourhood that's slowly but surely gentrifying.

{"bus_id":"Hdzo5ggPswyv-8ZlW0PVLw", "text":"This is not anywhere close to authentic Italian gelato by any means, but for the price and the flavor of the gelato offered here, over the summer we pretty much made this place a regular stop after dinner.   Apparently there used to be 64 flavors out at one time, but now there are somewhere in the 30's area and a case for cakes. Frankly, I don't care that there aren't 64 flavors to choose from at one time. That would be overwhelming. There are generally enough choices to keep everyone happy.  Flavor wise, the fruit flavors leave a lot to be desired. They are more icy than ice-creamy. So I don't tend to get those much. The pistachio and chocolate amaretto are my two favorite flavors though. I go back to them the most. I have also enjoyed butterfinger, just because I love butterfingers. Most of the other flavors are good as well.  For the sizes available the price for gelato here is also a good deal. We get smalls for $3.15 each. One of the cheaper prices we have seen among all gelato shops. And you can mix flavors in your cups. Two flavors in small and medium, and up to three flavors in the large size.   We have had to stop coming in though just because we both gained some weight over the summer and we are both on a health kick, trying to lose the pounds. But I would come back here again eventually."}

For this reason, I've only been able to try their breakfast foods (lunch isn't served until 11) but I've been impressed with everything I've had.   Their breakfast sandwiches are hearty but not too heavy, and the pastries are light and satisfying. I love the flavor combinations: orange and pistachio, blueberry and almond, coconut and cashew, classic mixed berry... and to top it all off, the prices are comparable/lower than chains or other cafés like this one.   Everything is made in-house, so even if you go for the day-old half-price pastries, it's still fresher than just about anything else you can find in the area. Plus the counter staff are friendly without being onobnoxious or annoying. Bluebird Kitchen is definitely the type of restaurant Pittsburgh needs more of."}

If I didn't, my asian citizenship might have been taken away.  There are now only 2 places that come to my mind when I want gelato. Angel Sweets and Gelato 64. By far, these are the two best places for gelato. There isn't even a contest.  The strawberry cheesecake had an amazing texture that was somehow gelato and still had remnants of cheesecake. It was a perfectly well done recipe with the perfect amount of sweetness and just a hint of tartness from the strawberries.  Double fudge chocolate brownie was also mind bogglingly delicious. Again, the texture was perfected to give your mouth an explosion that would rival the creation of the universe. The brownie 'chunks' were sized perfectly and it made every small bite a pleasure to have.   I can't recommend this place enough. I usually hate to drive to Lee Lee's because of the darn fish smell, but I will be more than happy to drop my mom off to do her shopping while I enjoy a soothing sample of Arizona's finest gelato."}

Every employee I've interacted with the few times I've come here was very pleasant and that made for a favorable experience. You don't get that everywhere and it's important. Good job with the staff.   To be honest I'm not 100% sure I understand the logic behind a combination seafood & BBQ restaurant, and the old 'jack of all trades, master of none' cliche had me a bit hesitant to try this place. That said, it's actually pretty decent.   I've mostly gotten things that are sorta-quasi healthy which maybe I should indulge in a big pile of brisket instead? The last time I went, I got a combo of catfish and pulled pork, which both items were solid if maybe a bit unremarkable. When I ordered this and was asked which 2 sides I'd like, I thought I'd be getting a giant amount of food, but the BBQ beans came in a metal ramekin kinda like you'd get a side of ketchup in, just a bit bigger, and there were maybe 8 hush puppies.   One thing that is definitely excellent is the jalapeno cheddar skillet cornbread. That stuff is real good.   Overall, for a relatively cheap and chill west side place to go that's a local business with good service and pretty OK food, you could certainly do a lot worse."}

Excellent meal.  My wife hade EGG AND CHEESE  SCRAMBLE  with a side of BACON.  With SOURDOUGH  TOAST.  She had coffee and I had iced tea. The portions where just right.  Price was even better.  The lady that runs the place was just the nicest person.  Oh yeah the RASPBERRY JELLY  was great also.  AND yes we will definitely go back next time we have to visit the dentist  or happen to be in the area."}
{"bus_id":"uKKNw68mZZaa1jcyszEbyA", "text":"A delicious update! I haven't been here since they expanded their space and changed up the menu a bit so we decided to try out Crepe Bar for breakfast today. We got here a few minutes after opening (9 AM on Sunday) and there was already a line 5-6 people deep to order! That gave us time to decide what to get at least. There is a good variety of savory and sweet crepes, various coffee and tea beverages, and a small selection of non crepe items. I had the octopus crepe, tried a bit of the tahini chicken crepe, and shared the dulce de leche crepe to finish our meal.   While we were waiting for our order the server brought out a small plate of chicharron with dipping sauce. It was a great way to pique our appetite and had a lovely presentation. Our entrees looked even more beautiful, with a well balanced presentation and mix of colors. My octopus crepe was served on 3 small crepes open faced. Because the crepes were thin, and the filling plentiful but crumbly it was hard to get a good bite of filling with crepe. I loved the presentation but I think having a more traditional folded up crepe would make it easier to eat the dish. In general the octopus was tender and flavorful but was slightly chewier than the amazing octopus dish at Virtu and Nico's Heirloom Kitchen. The chorizo in the dish was decent, but after a while I was wishing there were a slightly sweet element in the dish to balance out all the salty flavors. Perhaps a small squeeze of orange would help brighten up the dish.  I tried a bit of the tahini chicken crepe which had a lovely balance of flavors and textures. The chickpeas were a wonderful surprise as they were dehydrated so they tasted crispy and light.  Our dulce de leche crepe for dessert was amazing. The fresh slices of creamy banana went well with the soft crepe, lightly sweet sauce, and crunchy candied pepitas. I would definitely order this again (And again, and again)!  I ordered a Moroccan spiced almond milk latte, which had a subtle hint of exotic spice with a light flavor of honey. It was a well balanced drink. Note that the hot drinks (At least with my latte) are served in a cup that has no handle. My hands got a bit sticky since some of the coffee and milk spilled off the side and I had to grip the cup with both my hands to drink it (First world problems, right?).   Overall, it was an enjoyable experience. I will definitely come back again! Upgrade one star."}

Your sandwiches = amazing, but why no gluten free bread option? It is so easy for business to cater to that in this day and age. Everything from fruit and protein box options, eggs and bacon, to bagels and breads can be gluten free. You are a block away from a local gluten free bakery, why not partner with them to offer some pastry options. We like this stuff too, and I hate having to go someplace like Starbucks or coffee bean and tea leaf if I want a snack and drink. I like supporting smaller or more local shops, so it would be nice if local supported me!"}

The best part of this Starbucks is that the drive thru is in between the two buildings and shaded in the afternoon. This has to be a plus for the employees too!  I have to give a shout out to the barista who helped me today in the drive thru. My kids were so thirsty and he cheerfully gave them a cup of ice water. Don't mind tipping for that! Another great thing about this particular Starbucks is the scenery. You have a great view of the mountain."}

I've never tried CoCo before neither had I had a Pearl Milk Bubble Tea by myself since I've always been worried if I've gotten lactose intolerant, but I was fine and didn't react badly. At first taste, I fell in love instantly with how smooth the milk tea was! I've tried the Milk Tea from Chatime as well, but it just doesn't taste as smooth as CoCo's!  I always shake my bubble tea before I poke the straw in, since sometimes all the ingredients fall to the bottom, or if the ice doesn't mix properly with the tea yet! My drink is the most basic bubble tea flavour... It's the equivalent symbolism as getting a Caramel Frappuccino from Starbucks, hahaha!!  If you can't tell yet, I've been obsessed with CoCo and their Pearl Milk Tea.. I've been there about 3 times in the last month, which is a lot for me, haha.  I went back again with E and she got the January Special which was the Red Bean Matcha Milk Tea. It was only $3.80 for a Large size, thanks to the promo! My Pearl Milk Tea in Regular size is usually about $4 (without tax), so their tea of the month promo is pretty amazing!  I've also been getting my bubble teas with less sugar (50% sugar), and sometimes with less ice. Because I've been trying to cut back on sugar. Key word: trying .  PS: CoCo has a Vicinity membership point card, which is the same as Chatime - so you can use the same card to collect more points! So useful since I don't want to carry different loyalty cards. At bubble tea places, they don't usually prompt you if you have a membership card, so I usually ask or show them my card before tapping to receive my points. :)"}

{"bus_id":"mj25sM7NN3vB7uG0aF5H6Q", "text":"Calling all durian lovers! The durian flavoured mousse is a very unique twist on the salty cream-topped bubble tea trend. I chose this mousse in conjunction with Four Season tea and the two went together quite well. Well actually, the strong durian flavour overpowered the delicate taste of the tea, but I could still taste the slightly bitter undercurrent of real tea, so it's all good.  My boyfriend chose the aesthetically enticing Twilight Milk Tea, and we were both pleasantly surprised that it actually tastes good. I'm ordinarily no fan of red bean, but the drink is subtly balanced between creamy and refreshing.  *Note that Feng Cha's level of sweetness differs from that of other bubble tea joints. We initially asked for the sugar level to be reduced to 50%, but thankfully the person who took our order alerted us to this. We decided to opt for regular sweetness after his explanation and this level was actually perfect for us.  It takes much longer to receive a drink order than other bubble tea chains. Perhaps it is more time-consuming to make the drinks when they require artistically arranging fruits or creating cute designs. Or, the staff are still new and getting used to the drink recipes. At any rate, be glad that you can kill some time by taking pictures in the Insta-worthy space.  We also tried the chestnut chocolate bread as there was supposedly a promotion going on at the time ($5.99 for one piece, originally $6.49; menu board says $10.99?). Being freshly baked, it was soft and moist. However, even with the discount it is still quite pricey so we wouldn't purchase it often."}

We ordered the chorizo chile relleno, pan seared scallops, charred octupus, braised beef ravioli and poke tuna. There was plenty of food for our small party. The relleno had some delicious crumbled feta and corn creme on the side. The scallops were cooked to perfection with a golden brown crust and moist all throughout. We loved the beef ravioli. The ravioli is stuffed with some tender beef and the creamy pesto sauce was the best.   I really enjoyed my experience here. The ambience was really nice and the service was superb.

I had a picture of a topper that Yamilet re-created in our wedding colors - it was so adorable that I still have it on my kitchen counter weeks after the wedding.  I've heard nothing but raves from all of our guests about the 2 different flavors - we chose a chocolate cake with cappuccino filling for the top and bottom layer; and a white cake with their house special fruit for the middle layer.

My friend goes there often (he swears by there Americano which I've never had) and so we dropped in, in person around 4 pm to request a reservation for 2 for 7 pm that night. The waiter recognized my friend and took down his name.   When we arrived at 7 pm our table was ready for us. We ordered from the prix fixe Winter menu ($25/ each) for app, main, and dessert.   I had the lentil soup with a dollop of sour cream and it was yummy. My friend had the pork pâté with baguette crisps, butter, & delicious Dijon mustard which made the pâté taste deelish.   My main was the salmon almandine in a lemon butter sauce with fries and a small side of ratatouille (roasted veggies the French are famous for). My salmon was lemony and ever so slightly over cooked but still yummy. She brought us mayonnaise & ketchup on request to dip our fries in   My friend ordered the flank steak which also came w/French fries and sautéed onions. It was a bit chewy but flavorful. He liked my salmon better.   For dessert we got one chocolate mousse with real whip cream and one crême brûlée. Portion was small but that's probably a good thing as we were full! Both were decent and nice to finish the meal with something sweet.   Considering one main alone was $21-24, the prix fixe menu was a good deal. But I think the a la carte menu's steak is a lot better cut than the flank steak (purely a guess on my part). Something to keep in mind.

Across from the outdoor skating rink and perfect to sit by the ledge to people watch, the location was prime for tea connesieurs... or people who are just freezing cold in need of a drinK! Like any gourmet tea shop, there were large tins of tea leaves on the walls, and although the tea menu seemed interesting enough, you can get any specialty tea as your drink. We didn't know what to get... so the lady suggested the Goji Berries... it smelled so succulent and juicy... instantly SOLD! I got it into a tea latte and watched the tea steep while the milk was steamed, and surprisingly, with the click of a button, all the water from the tea can be instantly drained into the cup (see photo).. very fascinating!  The tea was aromatic and tasty, not over powering. The price was also very reasonable and I recommend everyone to get a taste of this place :)"}

My first impression as soon as I walk inside the door, I instantly feel warm, cozy and right at home. We had an early dinner on a Saturday night, probably the third table to be seated. The hostess immediately sat us at a very corner of the restaurant with a window view to the outdoor garden patio. My back was against the wall sitting on a very long wooden church bench, a pew. Within 30 minutes, the place was packed and the tables were filled up.  I was hungry and saving my appetite all day. I proceeded to order a chicken liver salad that came with a nice warm poached egg on top. I also ordered a glass of risling. The moment I took my first bite, my palet were opening up to total heaven!!! It made sitting on the church pew feel  more heavenly. By far, one of the best salad I had in Charlotte! (True meaning of Yum Salad. It is a famous salad in South East Asia). If I can lick the juice of the plate, I would. Luckily for my date, the waitress brought the spoon for me to scrap every juice of the dressing left on my plate!! YUM!!! By this time, the French owner came over and introduce himself as Fabrice! Very nice guy.  For my main course, I ordered the duck breast with artichoke, cooked as the chef would recommend. The duck breast was plumb and juicy, slightly more cooked than what I was used to, but it was still delish! The cream sauce was slightly heavy for me as I took my time sipping on my merlot chatting with my conservative attorney date who was not too familiar with French dining. He ordered overcooked steak and french fries! Bless his heart!  I love this place and  the location which is close to uptown and on a trendy mixed cultural district of Charlotte, Central Avenue!!"}

I don't recall what my breakfast mates had because I was too busy indulging myself in that delicious omelette. And, I forgot to mention, the coffee is just outstanding.    Candy's Kitchen is simply laid out, nicely decorated in country-ish decor that's not that traditional tacky duck-themed thing.

Our problem is, we always end up eating lunch way too late and never make it to cupcake time.  Yesterday, we made a point to eat lunch at 11:30 and then skipped right over to Tammie Coe.   The cakes and cupcakes and cute little tarts are absolutely gorgeous. We were overwhelmed by our 4 cupcake choices (we wanted them all), and ultimately both of my co-workers chose the Ooey Gooey and I had the Vanilla Toffee.   We got back to our office and dove in. My Vanilla Toffee cupcake had so much frosting, it was way too much for me. Granted, I'm not a frosting kind of girl, but even my co-worker commented on both the amount of frosting on my cupcake and then texture. Her cake was lighter and smoother, while mine was incredibly dense. If I go back for another cupcake, it will be for the Ooey Gooey (there is a good reason why this one is their most popular, I'm sure).   I indulged in Tammie Coe once prior at a friend's birthday. I still don't know if it was the cake or the assortment of very sweet cocktails, but I remember not being a huge fan of the very very rich, very decadent birthday cake.

The indoor tables were already full, but we shared a larger table by the door.  The place is small, but nicely painted--whoever designed (& painted!) did a great job!  But the menu is the masterpiece.  There is a savory and a sweet menu.  My friend ordered from the sweet side and I ordered from the savory side.  It was really hard to choose with so many creative combinations!  I chose the Grand Prix, which is a coffee crepe, large cubes of pork belly, small cubes of pork jowl, an 'egg up' as they call it, with some maple syrup to enhance everything.  My friend got the Cherry French Toast (not the menu name-they have a much more clever name than that).  It was large enough that she shared a quarter piece of the 1' thick toast with me.  What we both noticed pretty quickly is that this kitchen likes to offset the sweet with a good dose of salt--think of salted caramel.  I ate all of mine but my friend couldn't finish hers.   By the end the flavors were almost a bit too much.  I would give them a second (& maybe a third) try though."}

The place is in a strip mall with 3 or 4 other restaurants in a heavy shopping area.  I called in for carry out carry out on my way home and I was told 10 to 15 which was ok. The full rack comes with two sides so I asked what the sides were and he rattled of about 12 different options so I chose Mac n cheese and brisket beans.  The place has a nice modern look with walls of color and exposed air ducts on the high ceiling. There is a cool salt water aquarium as you walk in. There is a small bar off to the side but everyone was in the tables eating.  The ribs looked good with a nice dark bark, see my pictures. The ribs were naked with sauce on the side so I could judge them, you have to ask for sauce on the side otherwise it's on the ribs. The ribs smelled smokey and had that nice red smoke ring. The ribs were not moist and tender nor did they fall clean off the bone. The bark was good with a peppery/hot finish. The texture of ribs were on the hard side and slightly dry, they probably were not made today. That being said I still liked them and when fresh out of the smoker they must be wonderful. The sauce was sweet, tangy with that same pepper/hot finish and I did put it on the ribs.  My sides were ok but nothing spectacular. The Mac n cheese noodles were not over cooked which I liked but the cheese sauce was just average with a pepper taste again, see my pictures. The brisket and beans were very tight and not watery in any way. It was very sweet and tangy with bits of brisket and better than the Mac.  Overall the the smoked ribs have potential and I didn't dislike my meal but if I were to get the ribs again I would ask when do they come out of the smoker and get right over to get them. The place is nice and the food is not bad but after having the BBQ power hitters, Smoque in Chicago and Papys in St. Louis to compare BBQ to I can only give three stars.  With that being said they have a good foundation for smoked BBQ ribs which was tasty and if they offered a fresh moist rack they could be BBQ greatness."}

I had high hopes for this place but as someone who grew up in Europe and ate crepes every week since I could remember I also had high exceptions  First of all if u want to make crepes take an egg, a cup of flour, a cup of milk and some salt ... mix it.  Take that mixture and pour a small amount in a frying pan and swish it around to cover the bottom... you are welcome I just saved you $10   I remember coming to a crepe place in a basement for french class in 10th grade, and just being astounded at how good it was.  I want to say it was Cafe Moulin, or its predecessor... im not sure, either way my experience went from amazing to meh.   I came here primarily because a friend had never had 'french' crepes. And unfortunately she left without having any.  Long story short... 4 crepes and $40 later we had what amounted to a meh experience.  Some of the savory crepes were decent but more of a snack than a meal.  As for the dessert crepes soooooo disappointing with the selection.  Half of the crepes or more had nutella on them So if u put nutella on a crepe u reallyh only have a few options nuts, crumbs or bananas.  the taste is so strong and overpowering that it makes the fruit sour or just eliminates it.

To say I went there everyday is an understatement. After all those experiences, I think I've overdosed on Java forever, because I haven't gone back.  Java has the same menu as Green Room, Red Room, and Nirvana. Same owners, same stuff. Basically this place is a godsend for any student -- you can eat and drink for under $10 on any given night. Their food is literally so cheap it doesn't make sense. And then you taste it, and you're like, 'Oh. Right. This is why it's cheap.'  The things I actually do love there are their deep fried tofu, the pad thai with shrimp, and their avocado brie sandwich (with the soup! mmm soup). Most of their entrees come with a side salad that looks so sad you want to fluff it up and make it happier.  But they do have cheap beer, cheap sangria and cheap food. I love this location because they have the little booths for two on the left -- very cute for dates.  Two things to note:  1) CASH ONLY. They have an ATM at the back that looks kinda sketchy so make sure you have cash on you.  2) When you go to the washroom, it is super weird because you have to walk THROUGH the kitchen and you see all the little Asian ladies making the food. Very awkward situation.  Oh yeah -- if you're in the area, Java's not all that bad. Just don't come expecting mid-blowing food and you'll be fine."}

It reminds me of the place where they would learn your name/order after a few days of being a regular customer.  The coffee, even though it was close to closing time, tasted pretty fresh.  I can image it gets busy during the mornings as there are only a few tables, but it was quiet and relaxing when I was there.  I didn't get to try any pastries, but the very-accommodating barista told me they are baked in-house.  Bonus points to the barista for not getting frustrated (or showing it at least) that two customers walked in around closing time.  He was really patient and you can tell he cares about the shop and coffee culture."}

{"bus_id":"sZf_KrF9ZLC7z4jiLGgVOw", "text":"My thesis statement: As far as trapped-in-stripmall coffeehouses go, Steve's Espresso is great.  Nothing fancy about the seating arrangements - basic tables and chairs, plus four leather chairs set by the door for leasurely reading-chatting (lots of reading material available behind the espresso machine). Walls are a warm, dark orange - not quite burnt sienna/raw umber territory but leaning in that direction (yeah, I view the world according to Crayola, wanna fight about it?) with random local art hanging. Light is just enough to do your reading/working, not too bright. Music selection is perfect: smooth electro-Brazilian-lounge stuff that you can easily put in the background and not let it distract you, but still relaxing.   As for the food and drink offerings: pastries/cookies for eats. Don't know if they actually make anything sandwich-wise (if they don't, I'd recommend going to Little India in the same shopping center for some chaat and then coming here). My medium decaf soy latte was decent - nothing amazing but the soy milk wasn't burnt or curdled so that's a plus. Barista was extremely courteous, and even threw away a shot he wasn't impressed with.  Their advertised free-WiFi wasn't working tonight - so the rating's going to slip a little, but not too much. Every coffeehouse has their WiFi snafus now and then, and I'll give these guys the benefit of the doubt that this doesn't happen too often.  Crowd looks mostly like ASU upperclassmen/grad students working on an assortment of theses, and I get the feeling that's the usual evening scene here. Mellow and not too loud, so a great place to get your work done. They're only open till 10 though, which for a student-heavy coffeehouse seems a little odd.   In conclusion, I'd say Steve's Espresso is a great coffeehouse for what it is. If I lived closeby I could definitely see myself coming here often, with or without a laptop. However, I don't live closeby - so who knows how many future trips I'll be making.   Rating: About 3.93 stars - round up to 4. *Almost* red-orange (or is it orange-red?).   Worth a trip if you're in the 'hood."}

Whether that's true or not is largely  besides the point, because this 'espresso bar' opened at a corner across from a Starbucks and a Second Cup, as well as down the street from a Tim Horton's, and it's still done exceptionally well.  Of course, considering how much coffee Annex people consume, I doubt that even a man who sells coffee out of a thermos would go out of business.  But Aroma is actually good.  They serve good americanos, and their mint tea is another popular choice.  They have a selection of healthy sandwiches, all of which are great.  I really can't name one in particular because the sandwich you get will totally depend on the mood you're in.  The often packed store is in the process of expanding.

The brick toast wasn't anything special and they just put a spread of sesame on toast so I would not recommend that. However, the shaved ice was really good. The Mango Shaved ice included a scoop of Vanilla ice cream, lychee jelly, mango fruit balls, and condensed milk!

The Coronado is a great place to introduce vegan/vegetarian food to your non-veg family and friends, as everything can be made vegan or vegetarian, so they can ease into the foods they're more familiar with (e.g. choice of eggs or tofu, cotija cheese or vegan cheese). It's counter service, so if it's your first time, it's not clear if you order right away or take a seat, but the employees are friendly and seem to recognize right away if you need a little guidance. Every time I come back, I always try a new pastry (particularly a new vegan pop tart) and new entree and I've never been disappointed. Plus, I love that The Coronado doesn't rely on mock meats as a restaurant. While I'm definitely not one to shy away from mock meats, it feels like a more impressive and wholesome dining experience having food THAT good and not needing some version of mock chicken, beef, etc. I guarantee you'll find something you like, whether you swing by for a pastry and coffee or tacos during happy hour."}

Well, once this show finished at The Rex Theater...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCZMiCfM1A4  I needed sustenance and some refuge from that haven for the obnoxious and drunk known as Carson Street.   Mike and Tony's was closing up for the night, and craving gyros, I had to keep moving past the bass-thumping bars, dodging the surly debutantes (they all HATE me, and I never even make eye contact with them, let alone leer at them. Is it because I DON'T leer at them? It's sad and patriarchal, but so are they, so I digress...), and flatulent, fatuous 'bros' as they are commonly referred to (they're real!), I had almost discarded all hope and headed straight towards the trolley stop until I came upon...  http://www.comicartcollection.com/images/wantlist/sphinx.jpg  No, I didn't encounter a super-villian. What I did encounter was a minor bliss.   I know nothing about hookah and have little interest in it, but when I sensed calm as I peeked into SCC and remembered that they do have a menu, I sat down in this carpeted room full of twentysomethings, all of whom were mocking the sounds of a babbling brook as they inhaled fumes from rubber tubes. Videos of gyrating belly dancers played on a television screen while everyone but the owner, my server, and I sat on pillows on the floor.   Is there a more peaceful place to simply escape from all the madness in this often raucous part of town?  Sphinx Cafe's menu doesn't aspire to be 'authentic' Egyptian (try Isis Cafe in Brookline for truer Egytpo-fare ), offering up a number of Mediterranean, Arabic, and quasi-Mediterranean/Arabic snacks and dishes for those who actually might want to eat instead of smoke...or toke.   The gyro I had came with potato chips and included rich, moist meat, crisp vegetables, and a fine, properly creamy-tangy tzatziki sauce. Although I could have done without being charged $2.50 for a can of ginger ale, the mild gouging affected me little considering my safe, civil, chill surroundings. That I went to a lounge in The South Side and didn't leave wanting to pulverize some greasy-haired mook is enough for me to recommend Sphinx Cafe to those who despise the bar scene and find themselves in the area on one of its worst two nights of the week. Perhaps, I'll cast my allergen-induced respiratory issues into the breeze and sample some hookah during a future visit to see what it's all about.  P.S. The service was friendly and fairly prompt considering the laid-back ambience.   P.P.S. For a small fee, one can rent board games to play.  P.P.P.S. They were open until 2AM!  P.P.P.P.S. The only music I heard in Sphinx Cafe was of the soft, Arabic kind that evening."}

You would never know it when you walk in today.  It's a bit of a trendy bar and restaurant. But there's a little bit more substance than just sizzle. They are very much into using local supplies from farmers and other artisan purveyors. Maybe they take it a step too far, in the fact that of the beer that they have on tap, half of them are from OHSO, which has a location in the next parking lot. I would've liked to see other wonderful local beer choices. (If I wanted OHSO's beer, I would've gone there, just saying).   It's got a wonderful open feeling in the restaurant. The kitchen is totally viewable from the bar. And you can see all of the bustling activity going on. The bar is also uniquely set up with a hundred bottles of alcohol attractively displayed. As you move toward the back of the restaurant they have a very large wine storage glass locker that goes from floor to ceiling Maybe 16 or 18 feet tall.  The crabcake is very attractively served on a bed of arugula and unlike others it is not filled with crackers. I liked the charred octopus but would not preferred that come with roasted potatoes. They have a nice charcuterie board as well as a hummus board. And a goat cheese bruschetta and I know the goat cheese comes from my friend Wendell Crow's Dairy.

The matzo ball soup (better than the version at Weiss) and thick-ass pastrami sandwiches are also pretty great.   2 ounce lox plate with a spinach and feta bagel and cheddar-garlic cream cheese: not a combo I'd normally opt for, but somehow it all really worked together- the fish was fresh and silky and plentiful, the bagel toasty and chewy, the schmear chunky with cheese and fragrant with garlic. Everything was plated beautifully too, a leaf of lettuce under all of the thick slices of tomato and red onion, a russian pickle, several slices of cucumber, and a handful of olives, too.  I peeked in the pastry case 'just for a look'- and walked out with a 'small' black and white, that was easily the size of my hand. Great cookie, overly sweet frosting.

There was tons of confusion happening at this location. There were people loitering that looked like they were in line, but weren't. It took a couple of tries for the staff to get the drink order right for the guests ahead of me. Other staff seemed to be running around like chickens with their heads cut off but no actual direction. The cashiers seemed to be trying to run food and make drinks while taking orders and confusing their runners.  Just not good.  November challenge 3/30"}
{"bus_id":"NX1281ugzs2navHAX5X9cQ", "text":"This is my first review on Yelp, as I will be writing a few reviews today of all the Taiwanese restaurants here in GTA.  If you are Taiwanese, and you speak Taiwanese, you will get the meaning of the name right away.  This is now my favorite Taiwanese restaurant in the GTA  The food here is very good, I've had the popcorn chicken, fried chichen breast with noodle, fried pork chop with noodle, minced pork on rice, Taiwanese sausage, fried tofu, 3 cup chicken(best in GTA).  All the dishes were well proportioned, and if you are from Taiwan, you will definitely like the taste, very authentic.  The way they deep fry the chicken breast and the pork chop is just like the night market in Taipei.    The snow ice is as good as it gets, and I am surprised at how big of a bowl they serve you, the whole family can share one.  I read here that people complain about service, just to be fair, I never just a restaurant on the service, as you don't always get the same server, you might have a good one the first time and a bad one the second time, but penalising the good food because of service is a waste of a meal.    I give it a 9 out of 10!"}

We've now been there for take-out sandwiches a dozen times, and each time we've had the best experience and the most satisfying and delicious food. The sandwiches are piled mile-high, so thick it's hard to get your mouth open wide enough to take a bite! And skimp on meat? Not at The Bagel Cafe. The meat was 4 inches high, and stacked tightly, served on homemade rye bread (utterly delicious--buy a loaf to take home!). Their pastrami and corned beef are the best I've ever had, hands down, anywhere. Don't forget to order the strawberry cream cake -- a 'piece' is large enough to eat sections of for a week at home. And mouth-watering delicious. We can't speak highly enough of our experience here. We go at least once a week now. What a FIND!"}

I was told by the ladies working that I could 'just scrape it off with a knife.' They didn't even offer to help fix it. The box they wanted me to take the cake home in also didn't fit the size of cake I ordered, and wouldn't come close to closing shut. I was told it costs extra for a box that will actually close...

Essentially a mason jar full of fruit bits and juice. I ordered a coffee (gravity dripped? Cool!) with condensed milk. It was definitely strong, but with a wonderful sweet finish. Our green tea cheesecake and macaroons were a great addition.  Today's visit we shared a Mega Mango Mason Jar Refresher, just as good as the first, and a pot of fragrant Jasmine tea. And while I beat my husband at Uno, we had some popcorn shrimp. Lightly fried, tasty, and a satisfying snack.

It's open until 10:30-ish, sometimes later on the weekends.  Due to this coupled with an open patio area with many options for seating, it's a popular hangout for all sorts so I enjoy dropping in for a few minutes and taking in the scene.    As far as service goes, it's pretty prompt.  I dunno where some people are going on about 'burnt shots,' (likely that the shot sat too long and just became bitter but whatever), but as someone who comes from a coffee background, I've never really had an issue with my drinks.  I've had one or two drinks max remade for me during the last five years that I've been a regular.  What's interesting is that just recently this Starbucks finally had their last barista turn over, completing a whole new staff since I first started coming here - which isn't bad, considering that's been over the stretch of years.    The drive-through is pitiful.  It's a terrible layout and anything more than two cars starts to cut into the lane leading in/out.  (I don't do drivethrough, I think that unless you have an army of children or whathave you that drive-throughs for COFFEE and drinks is just laziness all around but that's neither here nor there).

My favorite things on the menu are probably the smoothies- especially the Triple Berry Soy and House smoothies. The House smoothie is probably the best smooth I have ever had! The falafel is always perfectly seasoned and not too garlicky, unlike those you may find at many other chain restaurants. The only reason I am not giving this place 5 stars is because I find their milk teas a little too watery and a bit weak. Also, the quality of the food highly depends on who is on duty.

So I see this sign that says 'breakfast served ALL day' and I figured out perfect!  Our first visit there (and last) I'm trying to figure out the menu. I ask the waitress 'it says here all scrambled eggs' can I have sunny side up instead?'. She says 'Of course, anyway you want them other than hardboiled!'  Five minutes later I decide to order the 'dawn breaker' special with fried eggs, the waitress says'no that one is only available with scrambled eggs and you HAVE TO hurry up because the kitchen closes at 2:30'  'someone could have let us know before they sat us down, outside it says ALL day'  she answers 'but it doesn't say dinner!'  Good move dummy trying to win an argument with the client. I tell her ok but I want the eggs lightly scrambled not well done.  And of course I got scrambled eggs so overcooked they were hard enough to be hard boiled, and the bacon was MIA from the plate and the country potatoes were frozen. The reason I gave them 2 stars instead of 1 is because when I told the waitress that no, the food was not good she got the manager who came over, inquired and adjusted the bill. It still came to $11 for a salad and two coffees but I was not in the mood to go over the bill.

My friend mainly tagged along since I was in need of a caffeine (and treats) fix and wanted to check out a place that was more alluring than Timothy's. I ended up passing up one particular cafe in favor of this truly hidden gem. It was most definitely the name (!!Bread & Roses!! simply has quaint ring to it) that drew me to it and once I saw the delectable display of gelati and very well-crafted cakes and pastries my friend and I both were convinced to try it out. Service was prompt and positive. I think we both got a medium sized gelato each, which came with two generous scoops as shown in the pictures. I also remember the coffee retaining a strong enough flavor of caffeine.  I returned for a second trip today to get their cakes even though they are a tad bit pricey at a little over $6 dollars per portion and decided on the Tarte aux Fruits and Dumas a chocolate mousse based cake, both which just looked too good to be devoured.

{"bus_id":"hl6s4hGsJDcRhHIWrSM-UA", "text":"This place has unanimously won the best hookah place in Vegas in my book. I've visited almost ALL local hookah lounges/restaurants in the valley and I've come to the easy conclusion that Azuza Hookah Lounge & Cafe is the best there is.  Here is why:  1) HOOKAH: Everything they do leading up to making a good hookah bowl is pretty standard and similar to most places, however, the ice-filled bases are a HUGE plus in terms of smoothness. The employee knowledge on the different types of hookah smoking is impressive and informative. They are excellent with their ability to match/mix flavors to your liking. They are understanding when you're not satisfied and will not hesitate to please your hookah taste buds (at least in many of my experiences). SEVERAL of the bowls I've had there last long (beyond two hours). Of course that can change with the frequency of your smoking. The hookahs and hoses are all a high quality and clean (fancy too).  2) FOOD/DRINKS: The food is excellent. All organic and fresh. You can't find another hookah lounge with food at these prices that taste like this. The drinks are eclectic (non-alcoholic). None of them disappoint. Anything from hot tea to iced juices are awesome.  3) EMPLOYEES: The employees are respectful, knowledgeable, and friendly. I treat the employees with respect and they return with respect as well. They handle any issue you have with food or hookah willingly, respectfully, and swiftly. It can get busy at times and service can take longer at times, but that's how it gets sometimes. They know the menu and are excellent with recommendations. They have uniforms that allow customers to distinct who is an employee and who isn't (some places don't do that).  4) AMBIANCE: Good clean space. It's a lounge so when I see people complain about 'table space' I would suggest going to a restaurant. I make due with the space at hand. The music ranges from electric, dub-step, hip hop, and reggae. They mix it up often. I LOVE when they play reggae there. The music isn't played at an ear-piercing volume consistently (like other hookah places).   5) PRICE: Reasonable & fair. The regular price for hookah is the similar to all the hookah places in the Valley but there is a happy hour for hookah from 5-8PM. I go there during that time often. The food is worth the money and so are the drinks.  I have my own hookahs at home (several of them) but when I want to wind down from a hard day work, I choose no other place than Azuza Hookah Lounge & Cafe. It's an awesome hookah place with culture, good food, good drinks, and friendly employees. I follow then on twitter and facebook for any specials they may have.  Thank you Azuza."}

It was very nice on the patio and had a great ambience.  When we arrived, the hostess was rude and kept walking by us with a scowl on her face.  Took quite a while for them to get a table together and even then it was too small.  Luckily, most people were sharing food so we had enough room.  The waitress was impatient and forgot to bring one drink (which we later had to have removed from the bill).  I ordered a tuna salad with house made blue cheese dressing.  It was very good.  One of our group ordered a delicious coffee drink and another ordered the moscow mule and said it was great.  One person went to the bar for a margarita and it literally took 20 minutes.  She did like the drink and said it was the strongest she ever had.  When it came time to pay, the waitress said she could not do separate checks and even asked the owner, who also said no, not for big groups.  Would have been nice to know when we sat down.   I asked if there was an ATM and she said no.  I asked if there was one in the shopping center nearby and she said she had no idea.  Instead of giving us any options she simply walked away.  About 10 minutes later, we learned from the owner that while they would not do separate checks, they would allow multiple credit cards.  Again, just tell us and there is no problem.  I really want to try some of their signature cocktails, so I may go back."}

{"bus_id":"3hXj186OqG1jb8nh4-V3IA", "text":"Order:  - Small Brazilian hazelnut latte ($4.05) - Small Latte ($3.55)  You WILL regret not ordering something from their freshly baked pastries.. I repeat, you will regret it!  I couldn't help but to stare at the table behind us. They ordered croissants & we didn't. The moment they sat down with their tray of butter croissant and who knows what else the smell travelled straight into my nose. Oh man. It smelled so good. Which means this place would be an awesome breakfast/study hangout. It can't get any better than being surrounded by fresh pastry & coffee aroma.  The Brazilian Hazelnut Latte is apparently a new addition to their menu. The first couple of sips it was really aromatic and delicious, but after you hit the half cup mark it starts getting a little too sweet. If you love sweets, then it's for you. Unfortunately it was too sweet for me.  The Latte on the other hand was nice and strong. Your typical latte really. I kinda like Kensington Market's  Moonbean Coffee's latte more. I wasn't here for the latte art, but I was kinda hoping they'd do something better than a simple heart. Oh wells!  Price: Good! - I mean compared to Tim Hortons & Mcdonalds it's obviously on the pricier end but compared to Starbucks? Aroma is so much better than Starbucks.   Location: To be honest they kind of have it in a bad location. Should've went far away from Cinnabon. I was almost tempted to go over to Cinnabon instead! It's literally the first thing I smelled when I walked into the mall entrance by Aroma.   Service:  Fast and the staff (the one that served me) was suuuuper helpful & suuuper sweet (by sweet I mean friendly). Just for that I am so coming back.  It's about time there's finally a decent coffee place in Markham.  P.s: comes with complimentary chocolate !"}

It is a cute cafe, with huge display cases full of any type of sweet you can imagine, all look home made. They also have the biggest variety of bagels and cream cheese i have ever seen.   I sat down, menus are pretty cute, they are newspapers. The food was out of this world! Everything was fresh and I enjoyed every bit of breakfast. I had the white fish salad and an egg, sausage, tomato bagel.  I didn't give it five stars because of the service. They were quick to put my order in and i did receive my food not shortly after. However the waitress was overwhelmed with tables to get me my check. That part took almost twenty minutes. The staff does all help each other out and work together, which you don't see many places.

I wanted a place that both my date and I could enjoy so I liked that they offered coffee/tea AND beer! Haha. Just in case I needed to switch from coffee if ya know what I mean ;) ... just kidding ... The place is in a random location, but quaint and cute and they've done well at making it seem zen and not like you're in the middle of some random plaza and on a major street. It's very small inside but cozy. The patio is great, so pretty visually and birds all around chirpy and happy.   Pricing was very reasonable IMO and although I'm not much into (or know about) coffee I enjoyed mine!

My order came so fast that I thought I was in Chinatown. It takes less than a minute to get and serve you your coffee. It's the penny counting by customers that hold up the process. The place is small and not ideal for group meetings and this is too busy, and noisy, to have a sit down conversation. The coffee is well... taste like Tim Hortons.   BUT they are efficient.

The smoothie was very sweet but refreshing, and I could definitely taste the taro in the drink. The boba was nicely soft and chewy. They also have different popping boba flavors and jellies.

Smaller menu, but the food all sounded delicious!!  I was really excited about the melon and feta salad!  Our server was Drew and he was nice.  For drinks, we ordered an OHSO beer, a glass of 'complicated' Chardonnay (which Drew said was recommended by owner, explaining she had chosen all the wines), and a lavender cappuccino.  For dinner, I had the melon and feta salad and added Mexican king prawns (delicious!!), and my friends had the short rib ravioli and the grilled cheese/tomato soup.  All the food was excellent!!

You can throw a rock and hit some artwork (but please don't throw rocks or you might be asked to leave). Even though there are no taps, they have a small to moderate but impressive selection of canned and bottled beers (including three NODA options). High quality coffee/espresso offerings. I had a cafe au lait and can of beer - yes, in my world they go together. I noticed a menu board that looked like they had breakfast offerings + sandwiches.

The people you sat down long after us order two sandwiches and they got their food quicker than us. The food was great. Eggs were perfect and not just put together real fast. French toast had four huge pieces. I order the everything bagel, it would have been good if they didn't burn the top. The food was great.   The services was just horrible. And not even worth it. When we finished we waited for our server to come with the check and we waited around 15 minutes for her to come. We never got any refills or even check on to make sure things were good.

Especially during a weekend, it is reasonable to expect a wait time of 10-15 minutes.   I ordered spinach and feta with eggs the first time. It is good. Their crepes are thick and well cooked. They serve it with a salad and it is usually fresh. My friends ordered the Alaskan and chicken (Marseille) crepes both of which they thought are tastier than the spinach and feta. So, if you are not a vegetarian, you might want to consider ordering those over the vegetarian options.   The second time, I started with a cup of Cappuccino and I am pleasantly surprised by the creaminess. This time I ordered the Tivoli which is served with tomatoe pesto, spinach and mozarella. By the way, tomatoe pesto is also used in alaskan crepe and it is delicious.   I will go back again and try the Alaskan or Marseille crepes next time.

The Earl Grey and Lychee Rose are the BEST flavours there.  Everything from its size, flavour, colour, presentation, and even sandwich ratio was perfect (compared to other Markham shops).  The prices vary by flavour but each piece can run from $2.25-$2.50 (no tax on half dozen).  So if you can't afford to fly to Paris or New York or you're too lazy to drive down to Nadege, take my advice and visit Ruelo.  This place serves cakes, coffee, and high tea as well if you're craving something different. The coffee isn't the greatest but when you pair it with something as delectable as the pistachio macaron, you won't even notice.  EDIT - Jun 14/11 - I finally had the chance to try the Wasabi Grapefruit macaron.  They never seemed to have it when I go, but this time I was lucky enough to grab one.  I was skeptical at first about the combination of japanese mustard with the bitter grapefruit, but it works!  Definitely go try!"}

{"bus_id":"g0yeRwvJmdd-XrH9lye0ww", "text":"This is a gem of a coffee shop. It has that hard to find mix of excellent coffee paired with a comfortable space where you can either linger with friends or work on your laptop. The owner is a kind but no-nonsense guy who makes sure you like what he's served you before he gets you to pay.  The coffee itself is Australian-style, so you can get your long black, short black, flat white, and so on here. The owner-barista knows what he's doing here, so the drinks are done well.  What really puts this place over the top is the space itself. As you enter, it is immediately welcoming, especially because of the sign welcoming all races, genders, and identities. Inside, it feels like the library in your uncle's cozy country residence (if he had such a thing), but transported into downtown Toronto. There are newspapers and books strewn about the mix of tables, photos and paintings adorning the walls, and even a wall of diplomas from a variety of global universities. Most of the tables have outlets nearby, and the owner has placed handy adapter cables around the place so you can charge your phone. Also, as a side note, the ingeniously designed toilet/bathroom sink is worth a look.  This is a place definitely worth seeking out if you want a break from all the coffee chains that populate Toronto's downtown core."}

The door was opened for me upon approaching it, and I was warmly greeted by a man who I assumed to be the owner.  That was awesome.  Getting inside, there are children crawling around on the ground and on furniture, literally screaming... and it smells.  I walked up to the counter and a girl said 'hi,' I said, 'hi,' and I looked  up at the menu to see what I wanted... I kept looking and kept thinking and she remained silent and just stared at me.... this is not the kind of service I expect at a coffee shop... maybe some suggestions, or questions... 'so is this your first time here?' would have been nice.  Just silence.  I ended up just ordering a toddy, and it was okay.  I prefer the ones from Cartel most definitely though.   I went to throw my straw wrapper away and the counter with forks and condiments and sugar and whatnot was visibly sticky and gross.  There was a bin with a sign over it reading 'dirty dishes,' that was indeed FILLED with dirty, smelly dishes.  The owner thanked me and said goodbye on my way out."}
{"bus_id":"X8AGCsJHw-GuTqkzy2J3cg", "text":"I went here twice in two days. The first for lunch, where I had the salad with tuna, hard boiled egg, oven dried tomatoes, and haricot verts and a GF peanut butter bacon cookie. The cookie was so amazing! I was dubious at first of the flavour but was really surprised at how much I liked it! If you're looking for a quick salad, this is a good option because they are pre-made with your choice of dressing on the side. The next day I came back for breakfast with a friend. Although the experience was fine, I was a little bit irked with the service. First, we wanted to share the 'frittata' and a smoothie. It is unclear on the menu that it's actually a frittata sandwich served on a roll. Being gluten free, my friend asked for a substitute for the bread -- anything without wheat. The girl helping us said we could get the granola/yoghurt INSTEAD of the bread, but when we went to check out she charged us for the whole parfait. If I hear 'instead of' without a follow up of a price change, I assume it's for free and don't want to be charged for it. We ended up having just the frittata without bread which was fine. The other problem was that I asked for almond milk for my coffee and the girl said they didn't have any almond milk but could give me soy milk. But we had ordered the 'April smoothie' which had almond milk in it and when I asked about that she said, 'oh right, I was going to make it with soy milk.' We ended up not having a problem with the soy milk, but I think it's dangerous to not mention it because it is possible we had a soy allergy and specifically ordered the smoothie because of the almond milk! We didn't mind the soy milk in the smoothie at all, but I think it is something they should have mentioned to us before making it. I wanted to get another peanut butter bacon cookie, but they said they don't sell them at breakfast which is a huge bummer! I hope I can come back and have it again another time soon."}

I worked with them through email and they were so helpful. I told them my idea and they came through with a wonderful cake. My boyfriend is a huge baseball fanatic so I wanted a baseball field. We stayed at the Rio and they were able to deliver it to us at the hotel for a small extra charge. When it arrived and I saw the final product, I was amazed. He absolutely loved!!

It comes with a soup or salad - I always get the daily soup, and although it is always delicious, I find the soups tend to be a little salty for my taste. (But keep in mind, I am super picky about eating soups from restaurants as I am iffy about sodium content.) All this for - I think - $9? Totally worth it; definitely the best deal for lunch around.  The space is small though, so try to come here before or after the lunch hour rush. Or get your food to go! When it's nice out, there is a small patio open, which is nice.

The chicken spaghetti was ok, although could be better if it was more flavourful.    The lychee strawberry drink that I got was nothing more than lychee juice you could buy from supermarket dressed up fancy with rose flakes.

What we had: various flavours of macarons, Ruelo cake, green tea red bean sesame cake, strawberry yuzu cake, white chocolate lemon cake (not listed on their website)  Taste: 10/10  Can we give 11/10? We absolutely love their cakes, especially the Ruelo cake. That's our favourite cake in the whole world. It's like Ferrero Rocher made into a super decadent cake. Their cakes are consistent masterpieces and look elegant. Their website has descriptions of the cakes so we will not go into detail in our review. The only cake that we weren't big on was the green tea red bean sesame cake because it was not sweet enough for our taste. If you like a cake that's very light tasting and has low sweetness, you may like the green tea cake.   The macarons here are good as well; the Ruelo macaron is Laura's favourite. One of the more recent flavours we've tried is the strawberry yogurt, which had the yogurty tartness and was interesting. We really really really want to try the Cream Cheese Orange flavour, but we never see it available in store. :(   Value: 5/10  Not going to lie, the goods are expensive. Like we've said about the other location:  The servings they list on their website are waaaaaaaay off. The small cake is supposed to serve 6-8 people? More like 6-8 mice, and that's being generous. We can each decimate a 5' mango almond cake on our own. (Not proud of it, but true facts.) That being said, their cake prices are cheaper and tastier than Nadege, and their single serving cakes are not too expensive (around $6, forget exact price).   Service/Convenience: 8/10  This location is in Time Square, and if you've been there, you know that finding parking is almost impossible. Once you manage to find parking, finding the store front is easy. We never tried their afternoon tea thing, but from the times we bought cakes and macarons, the staff here are very friendly and efficient.  When we came here to get Laura's bday cake, the staff did not have a cake available but they were very accomodating; they were able to assemble the cake in 15 minutes.  Would go back? Yes, this is Laura's go-to cake store for special occasions.   Would recommend to friend? Yes, the cakes, and macarons if the friend is into macarons.  Similar places: Nadege Patisserie"}

There are newspapers in the front that look like daily news but it is actually their gigantic menu so it took us awhile for us to decide what we wanted.   I ended up getting their Smoked Turkey with Avocado, Tomato, and Bacon, which only comes in the bigger half pound portions. Be warned because I was expecting a small bite but their sandwiches are huge and is pretty much 1.5x meals for me but there is absolutely no sharing! Their turkey was a little dry but I'm glad they didn't skimp on the amount of turkey they gave. I was surprised that they gave a pickle beside the sandwich because I'm a huge fan of pickles but I only ended up eating half of it because of how salty it was.

They close extremely early. While most Starbucks close at 10, this place closes like at 7 or 8.   There is never any tables open if you want to use the wifi. The same people loiter here all day long, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.   My last drink here tasted like some guy  grabbed a stale cookie, crushed it in the palm of his hand, and dropped it into water mixed with chocolate syrup. It didn't even taste like coffee.   There is no such thing as half n half here.   It's so loud in here that you have to scream in order for the barista to hear you.   It's so loud in here that you won't hear the barista scream your name when your drink is ready.   There is a group  of middle-age men who sit outside with their puppies in order to get the attention of cutie-pie teenage girls. These guys have been doing this for so long that the puppies are now full grown dogs.   Also remember how this is Summerlin so everyone acts like they are 11 years old. They will complain about every little thing. If you are standing in line, the guys behind you will constantly keep bitching about how they hate waiting in line. This happens at every Summerlin business I go to. Why are Summerlin folks so impatient?   The parking lot in this particular area of the shopping center is very cramped. Either these people drive really bad or they are confused and think that this Starbucks has a drive-thru. I don't know how many times I narrowly avoided death in this parking lot.    These days I go to the Starbucks in Centennial near Floyd Lamb Park. The internet is much quicker, and they close at 10."}

There's a huge assortment of board games to choose from.  The lattes aren't bad either.  For $10, you'll be having fun playing what you want as well as sipping on a nice drink, which isn't too bad.

So of course, I got the Coco Milk Tea and replaced the bubbles with sago. The sago so interesting and different, but I surprisingly loved it.

Its nice inside and has a few comfy couches. This is an excellent place to study because it just gives off such a supportive vibe. They've even got some back rooms that can be reserved for various meetings. Note that if I see you talking loudly in the back rooms while I'm trying to study I just might slap you in the face. You can reserve them for ten dollars, which goes onto your saxby card if you have one, and can be immediately spent on coffee and snack items. It's more of a way of ensuring that room denizens buy coffee from the shop instead of just free loading on the space. Wifi is free for paying customers only, and I don't have a problem with that.  I've tried their french roast as well as their bold. Both are excellent, full bodied coffees, and at 2 dollars for a medium you can't go wrong.

I had a triple espresso con panna ($3.50) in a ceramic cup.  It packed a very smooth punch and was good to the last drop. If you enjoy a straight espresso, a con panna adds a little sweetness and doesn't overshadow the flavor.   Their drink sizes are interesting--short, tall, serious or extremely serious.

After waiting for seven minutes, I came back to discover that the barista finished his drink and hadn't even started on mine. She made mine finally, at this point I had waited over 15 minutes. I ordered a sweet drink, and it seriously was the most bitter drink I had ever had at any coffee shop. I don't even know what she made. The espresso tasted weird... So I asked her to remake it because there was no way I could drink any of it. This time I waited another 10 minutes for my drink, and I saw that she had used milk instead of almond milk like I requested. I'm allergic to milk. At this point it had been about 30 minutes since I ordered the first time and I was getting pretty damn frustrated. I asked once more if she could just remake them. I also requested a refund because of how long we were waiting. She finally finished my drinks about 45 minutes later. Get this. The manager or team lead guy came out and asked if everything was okay. We told him what happened, how it took 45 minutes to make a drink. (They weren't even busy, it was 11:30pm) and it took three times to get it right. He asked us if the drinks were fine now, and that if they were there was no refund needed. TERRIBLE customer service. Needless to say, we aren't coming back here. I don't recommend it.

After we were waited on, I heard girls laughing in the back so it's not like there weren't people there who could help .  I will not be coming back."}

My boyfriend and I finally came in on a Sunday morning and it was packed! I was so sad because I was starving and anxious for some delicious food. The wait was only about 15-20 minutes and we got to stare at all of the delicious-looking pastries in the mean time.  After being seated, we browsed through the menu (which looks like a newspaper) and it was pretty hard for us to make up our mind. My boyfriend decided to get the chicken-fried steak with eggs, potatoes, and a super egg onion bagel while I got the mushroom and cheese omelet with potatoes and a jalapeño cheese bagel.   His chicken-fried steak was delicious, he said, and the bagel was SO good. I definitely should have ordered that bagel instead because I felt that the jalapeño-cheddar bagel was lacking in flavor. It was still good, especially with their amazing cream cheese on the side, just not super flavorful.  My mushroom and cheese omelet was pretty good, cheesy and mushroomy like you'd expect. The fresh-squeezed orange juice was literally the best orange juice I've ever had in my life. No exaggeration there. It was delicious.   The service was quick and super friendly! After we ate, even though I was so full that I was bursting at the seams, we went to go get pastries. We splurged. We got raspberry, coconut lemon, blueberry, and apple cinnamon rugalach as well as a 'mini' eclaire, chocolate dipped macaroon, chocolate dipped Florentine, and raspberry linzer tart. We devoured all of those within 2 days of going there. No regrets... Besides not buying the coconut cream cake and almond horseshoe but we're saving those for next time! :D coming back soon!!"}

I've been to some other places where the toddy is still black when they give it to you (headache and the shakes soon follow).   I love the space. Quiet, relaxing, actual GOOD art on the walls.

I really wanted to try a couple of cupcakes to get a feel for cake quality and frosting before possibly ordering a birthday cake for an upcoming event.  There were no cupcakes on display, but they were quick to offer to frost a couple that were ready in the back.  This how they earned the one star I am giving  - nice to offer to go in back and make me a couple of cupcakes.  All they had ready were the 2 basics - chocolate and vanilla - so I opted for one of each frosted with their buttercream (I was offered buttercream or whipped icing).  They came out decorated with a very basic swirl, but that was fine with me - I care more about the taste anyway!  Tried both when I got home - the chocolate cake was so dry it just completely crumbled all over the plate, and it had no chocolate flavor - just a dry, brown cupcake.  The white was a little better texture-wise, at least it held together when I cut into it!  The flavor of the white one was fine, but nothing to dream about.  The thing that really made me sad, though, was the frosting!  It was called 'buttercream' but I am pretty positive it should have been called 'Crisco cream' because it tasted like crisco and sugar - no vanilla, no butter.  It was terrible!  I am sad to say I will not be returning to Baker Wee.  I know others have had better luck here, and maybe I just went on the wrong day, but I will just have to continue my search for a good local baker."}

My first impression was that the interior decorating was very pretty, comfortable and clean. It was not very busy but understandable since they just opened and are one of the only restaurants in the new/empty T&T plaza.  The server was very nice and prompt with our orders. They started us with complimentary edamame seasoned with salt, pepper and chopped garlic which they said was Taiwanese style. For food we ordered the crispy chicken and noodles (which is like popcorn chicken) and Taiwanese sausage and minced pork on rice. The prices were about the same as other bbt shops in the area, but portions are definitely a lot larger. For drinks I ordered the Wintermelon green tea with cream cap, as per the waitress recommended and I loved it! The cream is slightly salted which adds a nice flavor to the drink.  We didn't end up finishing our food and they even packed it for us in these cutely designed boxes. I will definitely be frequenting this place more often."}

All the tables were taken and the line was six deep.  The staff was extremely joyous and appeared to be enjoying the rush.  A staff member actually saved a table for us when one became available. The menu was easy to navigate and had something for everyone in my family. Previous reviews mentioned that the menu had lots  pork items, so we were prepared for slim pickings since were are a mostly vegetarian non pork eating (mainly personal reasons not religious) family.   However, there were plenty of items that fit the bill. My sons ordered and devoured the FIRST TIME (nutella, banana brulee) and the VANILLA BEAN CUSTARD with marinated strawberries and salted caramel.  My wife and I ordered the 13 MILE (Steadfast farm veggies plus French masala and buckweat crepes) and the BUCKWHEAT piquantee, mushroom ragout with horseradish havarti. The 13 Mile was surprisingly complex with French and South Indian flavors I certainly normally would not have made a crepe out of on my own, and the Buckwheat was savory, and had the right amount of cheese.  They brought out a granola sample that was light and house made with apricot slices ( fantastic) and also the House Brioche sampler which was too hard to eat-  about three times harder than an old crouton.  I am not sure what that was about.  Checking in on Yelp earned us a free coffee or tea.  Its a big bummer they have no decaf coffee or espresso."}

I was ready to give this place a 2-3/5, but then the guy who was serving us surprised me and gave me the best experience I could have possibly hoped for.  Context: If you know me, I have an anaphylactic peanut allergy, making any kind of food consumption particularly dangerous for 'may contain' environments and situations where the desserts are either made offsite or brought in from another bakery.   The desserts in this instance were brought in from another bakery, and thus the guy couldn't guarantee my safety. Dejected, I was ready to just order a tea, when he said 'but wait, I can probably whip up something special for you', and boy, did he impress.  The picture is what it looked like before I absolutely demolished it - but basically, it was the perfect dessert. Warm (bread?) on the outside, cool (vanilla ice cream) on the inside, covered in chocolate sauce. It was a perfect match - cool/warm, soft/crunchy, and for a few minutes, I tasted heaven.  I'm very glad we found this gem; I'd come back any day of the week for that kind of service.  Pros: - GREAT atmosphere - it's a house converted into a cafe - what more could you ask for? - AMAZING selection of teas. I had 'euphoria', but I was extremely impressed by the variety in offerings; normally, tea shops have a maximum of 3-5 teas, but this place easily had ten (and counting!). - IT HAS A PATIO. Think about it - it's summer, you want to sit somewhere nice, and people-watch, with a nice coffee/tea and some food. Where do you go? HERE. Sure, it's winter-time when I wrote this (complete with snow & below 10-degree weather), but it's definitely a nice thing to think about - AUTHENTIC French experience. The person working there was definitely a native French speaker. If I wasn't with people I was just acquainted with, I definitely would've tried to converse with the little French I knew. -- This includes the varieties of teas and desserts. Didn't try the other menu items, if they had them, but in my experience it's not often you come across a Parisian/French cafe in Toronto.  Cons: - Not amazing for bigger groups. We had 8 folks in our party, so it made seating arrangements particularly interesting. The person working there was able to accommodate us after shifting things around, but since he was the only one there, we could tell it might be a little troublesome. Not a big problem, but definitely interesting. - It's TINY. I think that's the point of a cafe, but at the same time, it'd be nice if it was bigger than the bottom floor of a house.  Apparently they've opened a new location! -- I definitely have to check it out in the future. Try this place out if you want a nice, quiet environment!"}

My wife had the eggplant lasagna and I opted, in spite of the 'you are what you eat' connotations, for the Chowdahead. My wife's dish was excellent, smoky and perfectly balanced taste and texturally. My Chowdahead, well let's just say the only superlative that could come close to describing it is 'wicked awesome.' For those of you not from New England, that means phenomenal. A fillet of salmon, which was perfectly cooked, lay atop a bed of the most wonderful chowder I've had south of the Mason-Dixon line.

{"bus_id":"qQCsLGMncJp1xWUGnOKCQA", "text":"I've been here twice, but plan to come back a few more times before I decide if there are enough pros to overcome the horrific management. They have HH 6am-6pm and a 'Munchie Hour' 4pm-6pm. The HH includes $6 mixed drinks, $5 wine, and $4 beer/cider. The Munchie Hour menu includes a list of 8 $3 bruschetta and $5 dips or a caprese salad. The employees who work here are pretty fantastic so no complaints there.  The first time I came here I got the Stacked Turkey sandwich with a side salad and an iced Nutella Mocha that they promote as 'the only Nutella Mocha in the valley' which isn't true. I've been to plenty of coffee shops that offer Nutella coffees in the valley. The Mocha was underwhelming. The Nutella didn't shine through at all, it just tasted like a milky Mocha. The Stacked Turkey had quite a bit of Turkey on it, the bread was delicious, and it had a horseradish Dijon spread that had a bite too it. I almost with there was a little less sauce because it overpowered it a bit. Other than that it was a fine sandwich. Nothing to write home about. The salad wasn't good. Small pile of leaves with a tasteless oil dripped on it.  I'm writing this review on my second visit. I got the Caramel Blended Freeze (they call it something similar to Starbucks' Frappuccino) and The OMG (prosciutto, mascarpone, fig, and honey sandwich) with a side tomato bisque soup. The soup is delicious, but pretty small. The Caramel Freeze was better than the Nutella Mocha, but not by much. It was still really milky and not too much flavor to it. It tasted like a milkshake made out of milk and ice with caramel drizzled in the cup. The real star of this show (besides the soup) is The OMG. This sandwich is an adventure of flavor. I literally said 'oh my god' out loud after my first bite. It's subtly sweet at first and takes you on a gentle rollercoaster ride as it turns salty in the best possible way. This sandwich is a work of art."}

I love cocktails with basil and this one was done right. I ordered the fried guacamole and chorizo tacos with tofu. The food was presented really nicely and tasted good. It didn't blow my mind, but I really liked the sauces they used on everything. They were just the right amount of spicy without setting my mouth on fire. I thought the tofu could have used some seasoning/salt. The service, however, did blow me away! They were so nice and accommodating and brought me silverware and drinks even though this is something that you self serve. The patio was really nice and I would have sat out there if it had been warmer. Definitely give this place a try!"}

{"bus_id":"hUUc0oOabym0V6nIB-oQhw", "text":"Whenever I go to Spin, usually after D&Bs nearby, I choose to get the 'Charlie Brown' on a waffle or crepe. Basically my favourite flavour of all time, mint chocolate! Or here, they call it their peppermint patty ice cream with andes chocolate mint swirls and fudge brownie bits along with a side serving of fudge sauce to pour on yourself.  Minus one star because its a bit messy here, not enough servers to go around to clean after the tables. Also can be a bit slow on both getting seated and being served... But would recommend when you are looking for late night dessert in this area of Vaughan, especially when you want a deadly sweet decadent one that is similar to Demetres.  Also its expensive for just ice cream and waffles, almost $15 after taxes, although the scoop of ice cream is big."}

I got three different things; two fig and goat cheese macaron, one mint and chocolate and one snicker doodle cupcake (see pics). All of them were delicious, specially the fig & goat cheese macaron.

However, the waitress that seated us described the lunch specials and it sounded really nice that I decided to try that instead.  The special consisted of gnocchi followed by a piece of veal cooked gremolata style and roasted potatoes. My friend ordered pasta with Ndjua sausage.  To start with, the gnocchi was very floury and just got stuck in the gum and the tomato  sauce it was tossed in did not add much flavour. So this did not really do anything for me. What raised the rating to a three star was the gremolata style veal, which was very nice, lemony and fresh. My friend's Ndjua pasta was very flavourful but a bit spicy.  To sum up:  + Good gremolata style veal + Good portion size for the lunch special + They have two different portion sizes: half and full so you can choose how much you want to eat + Friendly staff  - Bad gnocchi  + Half portion size is very small for the price you pay"}

Cheapest wash runs around $6 and the most expensive one clocks in at $12 plus they have options where you can bundle washes to get some for free.  The vacuums are ok - kind of hit or miss and I've had issues using my card at them. Bonus points for the covered vacuum area so you're (somewhat, depending on the time of day) shaded while you vacuum out your whip.  I have to say that I knocked a star off for the fact that I've come here twice while the wash was out of service. They completely rehauled the wash itself a few months back and I haven't had an issue since then but word to the wise: have a backup spot if you stop in while it's out of commission.

Firstly, there was no acknowledgement at the door. We waited at least 5 minutes before the server said a table would be ready in another 5 minutes. This wasnt a lack of table space but moreover the server being unable to focus on a single task at hand.   There was 3 of us and we got our orders in shortly after being seated. We waited an hour and 15 minutes before getting 3 breakfasts served; Eggs cosmo, Cowboy breakfast, and a bagel.   While we were waiting, we had cigarette breaks and upon asking for more coffee, we were forgotten. The server had began another task of serving someone else before getting our coffees.   The only redeeming quality of this experience was the actual end product.   Upom paying our bill at 3pm, the lady at the counter asked me how our breakfast was and i told her it was okay but it was a really long wait. I was met with no response. Im not the type to leave without tipping and i did so anyways. However, i really feel that i shouldnt have.   For 3 breakfasts, it ran me 2 hours and $60.

Empty boxes of pizza line the walls with drawings on them created by gratefully pizza satiated kids and artistic pizza lovers.  It's never boring while you wait for the pizza here as there's plenty of diversions, from reading the off-beat Blues Music posters (and of course there is some groovy Blues music playing in the background complete with images of Jake and Elroy plastered about) to the wise sage advice offered from books like 'Everything I know I learned on Acid' scattered about the place.   Hubby ordered the Memphis pulled pork which is gourmet smoked pulled pork in signature BBQ Sauce, freshly sliced Mozzarella and then topped with homemade  'Buddha Slaw'.  Hubby's reaction once eating this meal atop a pizza was just simply  'MmmmMMMmmmMmmmM!!'  I got the Very Veggie on a gluten free crust, sans onions and added goat cheese and I gotta say, it was pretty damn well the best G-Free pizza I've had in TO!!  The owner here is a super cool and friendly dude who also knows alot about sound tech was having an intense convo with hubby about speakers and headphones, and don't you know it by the time they started talking 'bout Sennheiser headphones our pizza was as good as done.

I mean, it's hard to not get something perfect that's bubbling in butter and garlic, but they managed. Escargot aside, the real reason this place gets a 3 is the wine and beer list. LACKING. The wine list was eclectic but the server had no idea about any of the bottles. And the beer list: five. Yes, five beers. Kill me.   There is this little weird mystery room in the back that's kinda like a bar lounge. If that place turns out to be cool, maybe Lulu's will be a hidden gem of a night spot.

I just went there for a grilled cheese and a cup of tomato soup and I was there for over twenty minutes waiting for my sandwich. I'm pretty confident that I could've made the sandwich myself with a Bic lighter if they'd handed over the ingredients. And I wasn't the only one waiting. There was a woman behind me pushing 15 minutes for a cup of soup, another pushing 20 for a salad. The thing that really blows my mind about the wait times at Barriques is that they don't appear to be understaffed.  What's up, guys? If you want the business that Bluephie's Diner's departure could yield, a grilled cheese is going to require less wait time than half of my lunch break, which is exactly what I wasted there today."}

The design was gorgeous. Little different from what I had asked for but it was so pretty that I don't even want to think about it!

{"bus_id":"NNR0daIlKHTp2yU3F4H36A", "text":"I'm fine paying a higher price point for a sandwich here because the quality used to be worth it. However, all the competent women who used to run this place have been replaced with (for lack of a more accurate word) dopey men. And this is relevant because if I make any request while a sandwich is being made, they act like I'm being a nag. Sexist tension is not a good appetizer.  Today I really gave up on this place. I'd been holding my tongue all while one of these new dopes made the most half-assed sandwich I've ever seen. I thought 'I'll just open it and rearrange it when I get back to the office, I don't wanna be a nag'. But who puts one thick vertical line of mayo down the centre of square bread? Or doesn't even ask if you want lettuce/tomato before cutting it? An untrained adult has better sandwich-instincts; it was like watching a toddler make a sandwich. And because of the grumpiness I've experience from employees here in the past, I felt under pressure to tiptoe around his feelings as if he were a toddler too.  I asked someone trained to correct it but they instead threw it in the trash, wasting all the time I'd spent away from my desk. I didn't have time for them to make a new one so had to ask for my money back, which they did resentfully as if it had been ME who threw the sandwich out. The whole experience had more of an impact than any sandwich-related experience should have, because they acted like I was being unreasonable for expecting the basic quality they're charging for. I could go get a ball of grease from the Tim Hortons if that's how I want to start my day.  If you're not going to supervise new hires, then invest a basic amount of time training them. Why does it seem like this place is run by people who've never handled food or money before? The only people who seem to know what they're doing are the two Asian women who work there. Make the older one the manager and let her do the hiring. She super competent and she's always friendly."}

I've gotten the Alaskan Crepe with smoked salmon and creme cheese and while I've never had a crepe (or at least a real crepe that didn't come from be frozen food section), if this is an indication of how a crepe should be, then I'm a fan. The savory crepes like mine come with a small, spring mix salad with a light oil dressing. The meal was light but left me satisfied while out and about.       I took my mom out for a late lunch and she had an egg crepe. She added bacon and a side of avocado. She only ate half, so I of course willingly finished it. The egg was done perfectly. I believe there was Brie in there which added a nice creaminess, and the bacon added that hint of salt that really made it for me.      Lastly we split a dessert crepe, it had maple syrup, walnuts, creamy cheese inside, and a side of whip cream. The waitress suggested strawberries and it was a good call. They were fresh and added a nice, clean taste to the dish. I definitely hope to stop back soon. The only real negative is that the place is a bit small.

I was aware that service times Canada are slower than in California, but it was comparatively an extremely long wait for a spaghetti.  My friend's then completed their meal so I requested the Spaghetti to-go. The women behind the counter wasn't exactly friendly.  Anyway, finally after a long wait, I get my Spaghetti in a to-go container.  After a short hop back to my friend's residence, I finally ate the Spaghetti. WOW!  It was an incredible Spaghetti, the noodles cooked al Dente.  Meat sauce was not too salty or too much tomatoes.  Garlic Bread toasted to perfection with just the right amount of garlic.

{"bus_id":"uKKNw68mZZaa1jcyszEbyA", "text":"Since my first visit in January, I've decided that whenever I'm visiting Phoenix, I'll dedicate a good hour of my day to my newest quartier géneral (spot), Crêpe Bar. Crêpe Bar's carte du jour manifests an aesthetic and novel approach to the French pancake classic commonly known as the crêpe. The crêperie-café ushers in sweet and stirring encounters, both culinary and social.  On that account, I turn the spotlight on to Shelby for the moment. Barista Shelby Moore serves up seasonally harvested Heart Coffee in baby blue and orangesicle- colored cups and suitably signs each brew with a heart. The Arizona native is a connoisseur of good food and surely good coffee; the French title gourmand describes him in every respect. Shelby's penchant for the culinary experience translates into effective editorial columns. The Class of 2014 scholar at ASU's Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication recently contributed to the March issue of Bite, a local food and drink magazine.   Each meal on Crêpe Bar's menu brings into play the winning features of its cuisine. The crêperie's attention to texture is exemplified in each crunch and each chew; hints of masala and vanilla bean prove its palate full-flavored.  I dedicated an hour to this hot spot with my friend Navi, indulging in a heart-to-heart over our jazzy cups of Heart Coffee. The window-side table for two provided a modest breeze and warm glow of sunshine."}

{"bus_id":"WOj8nPos3R9IIf0Pyttd8g", "text":"Oh Lulu, my sweet Lulu, five stars for you, darlin.   FOOD: I went here on two occasions. First, for a lunch experience, in which I got the nicoise salad. I did not like it. Why did I give this place five stars if I did not like the nicoise salad? This is because I was just made aware that I am not a fan of nicoise salad, and that is no fault of Lulu's, just my own tastes run differently. Because I couldn't handle the strong sardine and anchovie taste doesn't mean that the eggs weren't boiled to perfection, the greens, beans, and tomatoes weren't crisp, fresh and beautiful, and it doesn't mean that the potatoes weren't seasoned perfectly and the tuna wasn't seared the exact rare that I adore. This salad did, in fact, accomplish all of these things - the flavor of anchovie and sardine was just too strong, and I wasn't aware at the time that this is the main staple of a nicoise salad. So, if you do like strong flavors or do happen to love nicoise salad, you probably can't get better.   My friend got the petit filet braised in shallots and red wine reduction, with frites on the side. Absolutely flavorful and delicious, highly recommended.   We shared The Moviestar appetizer, which is fried calamari with a spicy slaw and 'Asian love sauce', which is all amazing. I highly recommend this calamari with a spicy twist.  On the second occasion, I went here with some friends. One got the brei-stuffed half-chicken, with whipped potatoes (gorgeous, juicy and delicious), the other got the calamari stuffed with cream spinich and salmon (also really delicious, but if you're put off from the texture of calamari if it's not fried, you may not like this dish).   I got the Moules (mussels), which is what they're famous for, I believe. They come three ways, and I chose moules Normande, which is mussels served in a flavorful thyme, mushroom and bacon bechamel. This is now one of my favorite dishes in the entire world. Not only was everything rich, creamy, flavorful, and complimented the mussels on every taste facet, but the mussels themselves were very high quality. Instead of getting some that are small, tough, or shrivled, these were all plump, juicy, tender and plainly put, perfect. I cannot think of anything that would make this dish better - it's stunning in its entirety.  As a side I ordered the braised fennel, which was an entire fennel bulb, split in half, and braised until brown and delicious. I soaked it in the leftover bechamel from my mussels, and it was a great finish.  SERVICE: Here's a contender. Service, while being polite and attentive, is very, very slow. If you are on a schedule, I would not count on keeping it if you go to Lulu's. This is one of those places where if you don't get an appetizer, the wait is very noticable. On the other hand, the food that they serve here is fresh, made to order, skillfully and perfectly done, with wonderful presentation, and I understand that that can take time, so I can't really count it against them. Just make sure you'll be able to extend your lunch hour if you go around then.  PRICE: This is going to surprise you - the prices are actually very reasonable, especially their lunch menu. They have moderate pricing for very fresh, well-prepared, and exquisit food. Fill yourself up with amazing mussels at lunch or dinner for $9, or $14 if you add sides. Burgers, apps, and small plates will run you $8-$14, and at lunch, the steaks are around $14 as well. Dinner, your price goes up with your selections to about $17-27, with the highest being the duck $30, and you get what you would at an 'upscale' restaurant in Charlotte for $35-$40 a plate.  OVERALL:  Food = delicous, intricate, and authentic Service = slow for preparation, so make sure you have some time to kill Price = truly amazing for what you get.  This place is a gem, I cannot wait to go back."}

I could understand that price if I was serving some gourmet breakfast spread; but this was not gourmet. The quiches were pretty good and the fruit was fresh, though the pastries were pretty bland and unappealing...most of them went untouched.  I am not sure what is more outrageous when I look at the bill; the $37.50 for paper plates and utensils or the $55 for two boxes of coffee.

Luckily, I have an understanding husband and friends that enjoy sitting in the shop with a sweet treat and a craft beer or coffee.   My absolute favorite is the fig and goat cheese {oversized} macaroon. When I had tried macaroons previously, I thought they were a bit overrated - a fad that just wasn't for me. Then...my world was rocked. The macaroon was the perfect balance of hard outer shell, soft, moist interior and the heavenly filling of the goat cheese and fig compote. AMAZING. My husband enjoys their cheesecakes, blondies, and weekly specialties.   Since my first taste, I have been a weekly customer. Usually choosing a new flavor of macaroon and always the fig and goat cheese (thankfully, that is a regular flavor.) You cannot go wrong with Gimme Some Sugar.   Go in - get a treat (or two), sip a coffee, and enjoy the beautiful display of amazing cakes. These girls are so talented - you will be a regular too."}

I'm usually in this area whenever I go to the dentist or get my hair done and failed to realize how close it was to both of those places for me!! Owen's is tucked away in the same strip as the Polished nail salon - right across the street from Atherton. All this time and I never paid attention!  I got to Owen's around 9:45 on a Saturday morning and was expecting to be met with a long line but thankfully it was not the case. I placed my order for a standard bacon & egg (no cheese please!) on an everything, a plain bagel (not toasted, only sliced), and coffee. For those three items, my total came to $9.36 which I found slightly ridiculous but whatevs. For the price, I didn't like the fact that there's only two coffee choices - decaf or regular. No flavored coffees to choose from but there's a slew of flavored creamers and half and half cups and sugars.  Once you place your order, you move over to the side to wait until your number is called out. Even though there was a good amount of people working behind the counter and not too busy, myself and others still had to wait a bit for our orders to be called. As I waited, I saw that they started to get busier and the line to place an order was getting longer. Once my number was called, I was very hungry and eager to jump right into my sandwich. I could feel the heat from the sandwich through the bag. And that sucker was HOT! like fresh out of the steamer hot. The bagel was nice and chewy but the everything bagel flavor was very underwhelming.  I'm looking forward to going back and trying one of their signature sandwich creations just so I can really get a taste of an authentic Owen's bagel sandwich experience."}

We order right away considering we didn't have much time to waste.   20 mins after ordering we noticed a few tables that showed up after us had already recieved their food. 20 mins later we noticed those tables already left and the people who got there after them had already ordered and received their food.   10 mins later I noticed a lady who had showed up about 10 mins ago had already recieved her food which was the same order as ours. At this point we recieved part of one of our orders... The rest of the food is no where in sight.  An hour after we order, we decided that we have to leave because of prior obligations. We complain to the cashier who then starts to rudely tell us food takes time to cook, but then or waitress who sees us leaving comes over and tells the cashier how we had been waiting for an hour for our food and it still hasn't come.

Whatever, I'll figure it out.  After reviewing the menu online and having my mind set on the BlackJack 21 Salad, I drove a few blocks down to the Cafe. I was immediately greeted enthusiastically by Xavier and then Rosa took care of my order. When I realized how small the container for the salad was, I was a bit worried that I wouldn't be satisfied. Rosa insisted that it may look small, but the various, nutritious contents will keep my stomach (and brain) happy. However, she also cheerfully gave me samples of a few other items if I wanted to try anything else, just in case.   5 samples later...  Damn. I am definitely coming back for the tacos, mock chicken salad wraps, zucchini wraps, and the macaroons. I ended up taking home the Blackjack 21 and Labenese Salad, both delicious but I can't take my mind off of the taco sample Rosa slipped me...curses! I'll be back.  p.s. You can tell everyone here is very passionate about the raw food lifestyle. Xavier chatted a few customers up, including me, about his own weight loss experience (215lbs to 140lbs I believe he said) by cutting out animal products and including his WoRx smoothies in his diet, and the foundation of the food and philosophy of the place.

It is really high quality, and this location has some of the better baristas in the employ of CB&TL. As other Yelpers mentioned, its usually hopping because of the proximity to UNLV. It is also super UNLV friendly with a discount for students, faculty and staff. Knowing that the price of the Starbucks in the Student Union is crazy high, its great to know that you can be rewarded for your studenthood, or general fondness for education at CB&TL. Today, I came in to order my usual the Soy African Sunrise Tea Latte. However, I was informed by the manager (much to my dismay) that the corporate office has discontinued the African Sunrise tea. That is a huge bummer. The manager then recommended a decaf Chai tea that was amazing.  I didn't get a pastry today, but I am a fan of the donuts and scones. They have Starbucks beat on that end.

The staff at Gotham deserve a lot of credit for being helpful when it comes to special ordering an item, finding a particular title, or getting a variant cover. They are super friendly about that. I've also never felt unwelcome in the store, and for a comic book shop, that is pretty important.   My difficulty is with the way that one employee --who I think is the manager -- tries to give me the hard sell whenever he's there. I have a subscription box, but I dread going in to pick up my comics when they come in, because it is next to impossible to quickly get in and out without pressure to buy something else if he's there. It's not just that he suggests another title I might like. I wouldn't have a problem with that. What I mean is, he really pushes hard for me to look at another thing, or a bunch of other stuff, when I unfortunately don't have the time to stay or the money to spend. I try to politely refuse, but this doesn't always work, and now I don't know how to deal with this without appearing rude. He's a very nice guy, but this sort of thing makes me really uncomfortable. I have a tiny little spending budget and am exhausted when I stop by after work, and have begun to find the experience of buying comics at Gotham to be stressful. I'm sure that can't be what anyone at the store wants.    I've never had any other issues, and I feel bad making this criticism about such nice people.

I would come back in the summer to give their ice cream to try.  I like the decor in this place, which is very clean and simple and bright. They have a small selection of cakes and a slightly larger selection of cookies here, but I wish they had more options in general. Also sometimes they tend to sell out of their more popular items (I went around 2 PM on a Sunday and they were out of their vanilla mille cake and something else.) I got their chocolate cake and it would definitely be well-received by a chocolate lover - it was very smooth and rich, and had these little crunchy pieces in it that added some extra texture. It was tasty, but didn't stand out to me as being particularly unique. I also got a sea salt and cappuccino cookie, and that I really enjoyed - the flavours were quite unique and the cookie was slightly chewy, which I liked.  I'd come back to try other things for sure!

Ordered a s'mores mocha and it was delish, so no complaints there other than I could have stood to have it a bit hotter.  That's all I had food/drink wise, but loved their attention to detail and ways they do things a bit different there.  i.e. I had to get my own lid for my travel cup (no big deal in my opinion), and all your trash/dishes go on a tray up at the counter rather than in a standard trash bin (wondering if that's so they can really control what's recycled?  If so, that is cool!).  I am a fan and would definitely return and try another drink and some snacks to see how those are!"}

It almost makes me feel like I'm somewhere Asia except for the fact that after I walked in, about ten gringos walked in behind me. Service appears to be quick as everyone was quickly served. In the span of sitting here and writing this review I would say 15 people have been served quickly. Which is good cause if everyone had came in the same state that I was in, if service was slow there might have been massive boboa craving crumpiness.  And I must remark pricing is reasonable. Which is always a bonus! Thanks Yelp for having mobile review. Craving satisfied, review written, I'm happily on my way out to my next venture!"}

Anyhow, back to the drinks. I looked at the menu and saw, the Military Latte. I was like... what in the world is that??? Apparently, it is made with condensed milk, matcha green tea powder and espresso. It was a Sunday afternoon, so I asked for a single shot only. This came out not long after and it looked quite nice. Tasted it after, it wasn't overpowering with flavour. I can taste the subtle sweetness of the condensed milk. I tasted the matcha green tea, however I couldn't taste the espresso.   One comment I had is... if you decide to come here, there's visitor parking that is linked to the condo building. However getting to and from the parking can be a bit tedious.

I've bought 8 juices from here, so my stamp card says. Yes, 8 juices in about 3 weeks since I first started coming here. My first time, I was given a sample of every single juice on their menu. Wow, what a nice welcome! Forget feeling guilty asking for more samples, I was happily surprised I could try every single one without feeling bad. Thank you for doing this for your customers. It works, I was hooked right away.   So far, my favorites are #2 Gin and Juice, #3 Nojito, #6 Kitchen Sink, #10 OMGinger. I am happy with the change in the recipe, please keep it. I did not like the original O-M-Ginger that I tried. But I like the new one! #11 Sweet Greens, #12 Snoop Dog, #15 Coco Crack (lloooooooveeee), #16 Green Party. #18, 19, and 20 are nut milks and are delicious! They do have added maple syrup which I was disappointed to see. I think the juice would be great without it. I no longer will buy those since they have added sugar. The owner told me the sugar in it is minimal, but I just think why add sugar to something that is supposed to be healthy. Unfortunately, I have it in my head that I am drinking sugar and can't get over it. I really love those drinks and wish they would stop adding that maple syrup to it and I will gladly buy it again. So if you are watching your sugar, beware of the added maple syrup. Thank you to the owner for standing by your products and allowing me to do a return. I really appreciate you backing up your juice and treating customers well. Please consider removing the maple syrup and I will be the first to come try it and give you my honest opinion of the taste.   I like their packaging, simple way of identifying drinks with a number system #1, 2, 3, etc. I like the glass bottles they come in, easy to drink out of. I like their happy hour specials 10% off during the last 2 hours of the day (but beware that they run out of the most popular juices by then often times), great customer service.

I personally had an espresso and their infamous Honey Bread but was also able to try one of their flavored drinks although I can't recall what it was today.  Busting a little coffee knowledge on you:  Cafe Darak uses local roaster Colorado River Coffee Roasters (AKA: CRCR) of which are located in Henderson, NV. They brewed my espresso using a Sumatra roast. The espresso was O.K., however if I am looking to have a drink when I come here, it is evident they are more forgiving with their flavored specialty drinks.  The Honey Bread was divine! Definitely pairs nicely with a standard coffee in my opinion but if you are feeling like something sweet, a flavored drink works well too.   The atmosphere was definitely very 'cute', with a little blow up van that you can sit in, small sitting areas and unique decor, it was definitely really nice being there, although it seems like they are lacking in some areas IMO.  Definitely check this place out if you are on a date, or just looking to feed your sweet-tooth cravings."}

{"bus_id":"9VSPMQXgPdJ4rNgBPLJZ1A", "text":"I love how Caffe Rosso loves coffee.  It should go without saying, but I think this is a point that some other coffee shops are missing.  Their baristas pull off being coffee geeks without being unapproachable or pretentious.  They serve Phil & Sebastians coffee, and take pride in making sure it is freshly roasted and ground.  I tried a pour over coffee for the first time here, and it was a lot of fun watching the technical elements of measuring everything out and carefully pouring the water.  The resulting product was pretty incredible, and had a depth of flavor that you rarely get in a cup 'o joe.  It came served in a wine glass, which added to the experience of my 5pm coffee.  And take note that it is an experience - a good pour over takes time, so don't order one when you are already 5 minutes late for your next meeting.  The atmosphere is cozy and welcoming, with wooden tables and chairs brightened by red decor accents.  It definitely is the type of place that makes you want to sit down, stay awhile and enjoy your coffee experience.  We were there during a slow time, but I think I might be hesitant to try and enjoy this experience during the morning coffee rush.  A few points for improvement:  the tables are awesomely rustic, but uncomfortably bumpy.  Rustic rocks, but when I'm trying to slide my perfection of a drink across the table, the bumps make me sad.  I also tried to pitch Rosso to my ****bucks loving sister, and she pouted when they told her they had no caramel... But the latte art made her happy.  So yay!  I like CR.  They are great for coffee lovers, and by adjusting a few small points they will appeal to everyone.  Review #6 for Yelp's 30 Day Review Challenge 2012"}

I've been coming here for over a year since I moved in down the street. They're convenient, open all the time, and have good coffee. I'd eaten here a few times, but was never astonished by their food. Never astonished, that is, until tonight.   From what I am to understand, the menu is receiving a much needed overhaul. Look at my pictures for things to come. They've recently brought in a local chef, Nick. Surely, they spared no expense to get this guy to cook for them.   Some friends and I came in, all ordered different things from a list of recommendations by the guys beyond the counter.   The food was FANTASTIC! I'd have expected to pay double for meals like this.

I saw other servers being consideraly more generous.   Barely any chicken, a spoon of avocado, spoon of Pineapple salsa, jalapenos, spinach, sauce. $18. There were a couple of other ingredients I'd added, I forgot which ones. I don't mind paying $20 for a poke bowl. At least the amount should be good enough to feel a little full. This was frugal.

We've come here a number of times for a DIY 6-pack and happily select from their craft beers in the back.  Then we grab a few macaroons- the flavors are always different. This time we tasted the lavender berry and the absinthe. The lavender berry had great flavor but I was not a fan of the absinthe, it was just as it sounds so if you don't like the taste of licorice flavored alcohol don't order it. The macaroons aren't the best quality, I wish I could tell you they taste like little bits of heaven but in reality they taste like average macaroons that will give your sweet tooth a fix that it needs. More importantly, the space is a combination of a grocery and dine in area. I can see how this concept may affect the ambience and experience for some diners seeking an immersive experience, but for a grocery store, the smells and selection, which are specialized in desserts, cheese, and alcohol, are fine enough for me."}

We also got two of their arancini - rice balls with ragu and peas. I wish they could put some sort of tomato-based sauce on top of them but they were delicious nonetheless and filling.

Our server informed us that it was his first night serving, and I totally wouldn't have known if he didn't say anything, because he did an excellent job!  The menu looked to have some good options on it. The bruschetta caught my eye because there were so many kinds, and they're $3 each which I think is pretty reasonable because they are big. I ordered 3 and it was a good amount. I got one with tomato, mozzarella, and basil, one with Brie, apples, and honey, and one with Gorgonzola with figs. Generally they were pretty good but not great, I thought there was too much bread. My favorite was the tomato mozzarella basil one. Though the middle of the bread was completely soggy with balsamic. The Gorgonzola fig one was my least favorite, too much cheese and not enough figs, the cheese was too strong to have so much on there. The brie apple honey one was in the middle, there wasn't enough Brie, but it was pretty good and I liked it. My sister got turkey burger sliders and she did not like them very much, said they made her feel sick. We also got spinach and artichoke dip which we all liked! My mom liked her salmon salad as well.

It's been years since I've actually eaten here, so I can't speak to current strengths/weaknesses of the dining experience.  The bagels, however, are good, if a bit pricey. You'd do better to get a Dozen (which really means 14) than just a handful. But get what you need - it'll be worth it."}

Several experiences with rude/unfriendly/unprofessional staff led me to send a message over Facebook to the manager. Apologies were delivered and commitments were made to address the person---only to go in the next day and experience it all over again! Appears the owner 'cleaned house'  this week (which seemed to be a good solution); however, he turned out to be less than 'accommodating' to his long term customers (like myself). They made the wrong drink and instead of apologizing and correcting it, he argued for 5 min. about how it was my daughter's (12 y/o) fault for ordering the wrong drink and that making her a new ice tea costs him 'a lot of money.' He then publicly humiliated us by vocalizing (as he made a poured a new tea) that this is a 'teaching lesson' for his staff. He was sure to mention how he was doing us a favor too!  The only lesson he taught his staff was how to effectively lose valuable customers. Oh, and he taught me how powerful a negative review on Yelp can really be! And for that, thank u!!"}

I love the smokehouse sausage breakfast sandwich but the last one I got  was from here and it was terrible. The sausages tasted uncooked, the egg was about twice the size of the english muffin, and the english muffin itself had been cooked way too long (not burned, but hard).  Another small plus, since theyre bigger, they tend to have more than one box of each flavor of KCup packs available. But if you purchase one, you have to deal w/ their register guy who is really not the brightest bulb in the box. Thats mean, I know, but its unfortunately true. Ive had the same guy 4 times and ive experienced slow service, having my order voided 2-3 times because wrong buttons were pushed, a reply of 'Huh?' to every order Ive made....super frustrating."}

I ordered the pistachio latte and my boyfriend first ordered the macadamia nut latte, the cashier said, the macadamia latte was not that popular and not that good so he decided on the peanut butter cup latte instead.  I  also added the honey toast with nutella to wrap up our order and was a little sticker shocked the order came out to about $20...oh well.  We sat down at this small coffee table ish area next to the volkswagon tent since all the other seating was pretty much taken up by people working on their laptops, well, its a coffee shop, what else should i expect?  The cashier brought over our drinks to where we were sitting and they were both really good!  I liked my pistachio latte a lot more than his peanut butter cup latte since I don't like drinks that are that sweet.  The honey toast took a while to come out, but when it came delivered to us, it was nice, warm, not too sweet and came topped off with whipped cream and vanilla ice cream.  This was exactly what i needed, a dessert that was not too sweet, not too filling and a latte for the cold night.  The cafe was cool, with lots of cool little oddities to look at, a record player, a volkswagon tent with fake grass, old student desks for a place to sit (which looked really uncomfortable) and an old school cash register just randomly on the floor.  There was some pretty cool music playing over the speakers but it still felt a little awkward being there to just hang out, i think this would be a cool place to do work, but there's not much seating there so you'd probably have to share table space with someone else.  Since I wasn't looking for a hang out spot, and just a place for dessert and coffee this place did the trick!"}

While on a quick vacation in Charlotte this week, my boyfriend and I ate a Rise. I ordered the 'righteous chicken' biscuit with white cheddar cheese and he ordered the 'bacon, fried egg, and cheese' biscuit. We both agreed both were delicious and very filling, might I add. The chicken was well seasoned, hot and just all around good. I'm very particular about my biscuits, but there's were that perfect balance of soft, not oily and firm.My boyfriend devoured his food in minutes. The only thing keeping this place from a 5/5 is the hashpuppies (paid almost an extra $2 for them too), wasn't crazy about them. I expected cheese melted on top of tater tots, however the cheese was the filling inside the tater tots instead. Next time, I'll try a donut, but we came an hour to close and their selection was extremely limited. Definitely go and enjoy a quality, inexpensive breakfast/lunch option."}

A busy location we were lucky to only wait a few minutes for a table on a Saturday morning. The inside of the restaurant is on the small side, but they have a nice outdoor patio for additional seating.   We started with their unique coffees. My Honey Vanilla Latte was delicious and not too sweet. The Coconut Tumeric Latte was also very good. Both were beautifully served like pieces of coffee art.  The House Empanadas had a delicious and flaky pastry. The filling inside and sauce on top were delicious too. My Chicken Tinga Benny was amazing. The chicken was nicely flavored, the eggs were perfectly poached, and the lime avocado cream really set off the other flavors. The Latin Hash + Maple Bacon was also a great meal. Everything we had was full of flavor."}

I have wanted to check out this place, I host an monthly breakfast club that runs on Sat, and though that this could be a cool place to check out, but when reading the menu it clearly states that they can host parties of up to 30 people, but on WEEKDAYS only, well guess this place is out of the BC loop.  When I 1st walked in a few things hit me  1) Plenty of signs on the door, inside the place and around the place that elude you to believe it's a cash only place and they have an ATM inside the joint, but on the door it states they take Visa & MasterCard, yep skipped the ATM fee and I ponied up the Visa  2) Did I just go to Miami? The inside of the place is painted as a cool little beach diner, white/cream and aqua colors, but like a 50's cool diner, this wasn't an new place   3) Signs stating to turn off Cell phones, um ok, I understand that in a small room it would be sort of rude to carry on a conversation, but people can text, and well play games, my phone was set to silent and while I was waiting to be waited on I did text & play a game   4) Hope the people around you are friendly because they are sitting just an elbow bump away, but it was ok with us, had a nice couple next to us and he commented on how it's like dinning on a cruise being close to fellow diners.  5) I being 40 felt like the new kid on the block, so I'm guess my daughter who is 22 felt really young haha  Also, again on being close to everyone you can hear what others are ordering or not ordering, and on the menu it stated that the house specialty is the Apple Pancake, and I was interested in trying it, but overheard another table inquiring about it and they were told it was a 45 min wait for the Apple Pancakes, and it's not that I was in a rush I just wasn't into waiting 45 mins to try it, maybe call a head for it?   After checking out the menu, and yes they have a few different types of pancakes, but nothing really wowed me, but I did see a Bacon stuffed pancake and you betcha that's what I ordered and ordered a side of home fries. The pancakes come with real butter and 2 ounces of syrup, for me that was not enough I like a little bit of pancake with my sweet sticky maple syrup, I did ask for more, but it still wasn't enough, some/most of the pancakes were dry, and I don't like them that way, but the bacon was a thick slice bacon, so very good, bacon and maple syrup is the best combo ever!   The home fries looked amazing, but they were under cooked, the potatoes were a little to hard for me.   Service was slow, it was weekday morning, so the place was semi steady , we were not check on to see if we needed/wanted anything but after 5 mins of getting our food our bill was presented to us and I was told we can take care of that at the front, kind of felt like it was a hurry up eat and get out kind of thing.  Glad I finally stopped by to check them out, but even with the few types of pancakes, I'm not sure I'll be back."}

I had been wanting to go for quite some time and finally got my wish.   The restaurant is very romantic and quaint. It has a very intimate feel and would be fabulous for an anniversary dinner or an evening out with a good friend. We wanted the true experience so we opted for four courses.   For our first course, we had The Movie Star which was calamari with slaw and asian love sauce. The calamari was crispy and delicious on its own but when combined with the slaw and sauce, it was fantastic.   The BLT wedge caught my eye so we decided to get it for our second course. It was definitely a wedge done very well. The overnight tomatoes were a great touch and the blue cheese was beyond delicious. There was a great deal of bacon on the salad which I really loved.   Everything on the menu sounded great so our choice of entree was very difficult. I chose the Mussels Normande in a cream sauce with bacon, mushrooms, and sherry. The portion was huge! The mussels were fresh and very good with the sauce. They portion of house made fries was also huge and delicious alone or when dipped in the  cream mussel bath! My friend ordered their gnocchi, which they are known for. The pasta was light and cooked to perfection. The accompanying ragout with Italian sausage was very flavorful. One would have a difficult time not licking their plate after consuming the pasta.   Although we were quite full, we had to order dessert. We decided to get the strawberry shortcake which was very light and a great way to end the meal. It was in the form of a layer cake and the strawberry preserves in the middle were fabulous.   I really enjoyed my experience at Lulu and was pleased the see that the prices were very reasonable. The portion sizes were also really big so you really feel like you are getting more bang for your buck. It would also be a really fun place to go and get small plates with a group of friends. I would definitely recommend Lulu because not only was the food amazing but the staff was very helpful and prompt."}

{"bus_id":"fE7x3Ui2mzdwdfJnd7r_1g", "text":"Yes!! A new location!  I was walking through Caesars Palace and noticed this Earl of Sandwich in the Forum Food Court. I had to help myself to a Full Montagu and a side of Mac and Cheese. I think this was the first time I had my sandwich with wheat bread. Not bad for the somewhat slightly health conscious people on vacation! I was a little disappointed that my sandwich was a lot smaller than the ones served at the Earl at Planet Hollywood across the street (I had the same sandwich late that night from this location). I felt like this Caesars location was a little skimpy on the meat as well as the vegetables. The Mac and Cheese was pretty good. Make sure you hold off on eating it quickly because it's super hot from the oven.   I noticed loaded baked potatoes on the menu at this location, which isn't available at the PH location. Potato lovers, eat your heart out!  Fountain drinks cost almost $5! Make sure you have an empty bladder to get enough refills!  If you have a Total Rewards players card you'll be able to get $1 off your sandwich. I unfortunately didn't have my card with me so I had to pay the extra dollar.  The staff is really friendly and since they just opened up, there's probably still a few kinks they need to work out (like their sandwich size). I'll be back soon!"}

I have tried their Matcha latte with both Almond milk and Cashew milk, as well as their traditional green tea bag, and drip coffee. With respect to goodies, i've tasted their matcha roll cake, matcha white academia cookie as well as vegan sugar free breakfast cookie - which was my absolute favourite, super nourishing, filling, chewy and satisfying. The service all 6 times has been phenomenal, as they have a smile on, greet you nicely, accomodate customers, and provide helpful answers with any questions. In addition to that, i had requested for a special latte art on my drink and the barista was kind enough to try his best to make what i requested. I would definitely recommend this place for a pick me up and lovely photos for food photographers. My only concern was seating, but if you go early enough or wait around you will definitely snatch a seat.

I have never had a long wait for anything I have ordered. As for snacks, they do have baklava, which is an unusual choice, albeit delicious!

Even though I'd like for these guys to find a possible better location where more people will find it, it sounds like they put a lot of time & effort into renovating this space & it's kind of nice for this neighborhood to have a cafe like this since there really isn't any other place like it in the area.

I'm not really sure what exactly you would consider this place.  Even though I didn't try any, they have more than a few coffee & espresso based drinks, but because they have so many sandwiches & wraps (as well as a couple salads) I really wouldn't consider this a coffee shop.    As far as the food, its' yummy! I had the breakfast sandwich on a cibatta roll & everything about it was perfect from the egg, to the bacon, to the pesto sauce which added a pleasantly surprising taste.  My mom had the exact same sandwich, except on a bagel instead.  My dad had a grilled cheese.

Surprising, this donut shop is a standalone building that has a drive thru and caters to fully hungry patrons by offering crossaint style sandwiches. The seating area was probably as big as a b grade chains dining area like del taco or Arby's.   The menu shows a picture of every donut they make and they are all 99 cents or less. Apple fritters and cinnamon rolls are my favorite so I was a bit worried they wouldn't have it. Well, they did. They have them in a mini size which is about the same size as a standard glazed donut. They also have stuffed donut holes with blueberry raspberry and Boston creme. They even have chocolate donut holes.   I ended up doing 4 donuts and eating 2 so far for only about $4. I chose to try the standard glazed and the Apple fritter first and man were they good. They weren't overly buttery and tasted fresh even though it was already 530pm at that point. They had pretty consistent traffic of customers and the gal working was fast and friendly with everyone.  It's definitely a good find and a great donut. Not the absolute best but still a great one."}

I say uneven because although our server was absolutely the worst, the table next to us got great service.   We stopped by for lunch about 1:00 pm on a Saturday, and the bunch menu looked great. Our server, Marika, took our orders, and I noticed that she didn't write anything down. That could be a sign of a real professional, but in this case it wasn't. A few minutes later she came back and told my wife that she had forgotten what she'd ordered.   Although most of us were just drinking water, my wife had ordered a bloody mary, which turned out to be delicious. However, it seemed to take forever, and my son, who sat facing the bar, said he had seen the bartender make a bloody mary, but it had been sitting on the bar for about 15 minutes before the server brought the 10 feet to our table. After tasting my wife's drink I would have ordered one, but she never came back to see if anyone wanted refills.   After finishing a very good meal -- highly recommend the PBLT --  we waited about 30 minutes for the check until I finally went to the bar to ask for it. Our server said something about sending someone over with it, and then apparently realized that we were her table. Yes, she actually forgot that she was serving us."}

On the day of, there was some tragic event that happened minutes before my tasting to someone who worked there. They still continued on with my tasting and gave me all the attention I needed. I thought this was really good customer service considering they could have cancelled my appointment, but they made me,  the customer first.   I wanted a fancy bling bling cake and although that is not what I got in the end, I was still happy with the taste of the cake. I believe it was Yamilet who helped me. I told her how I wanted diamond bling and lace and she drew up some ideas for me and even said if there were specific colors of ribbon/lace I wanted I could buy it and bring it by and she would just place it on, which is what I did. I thought that was really nice instead of just making me choose what they had there. I guess they have experienced enough bridezillas to know I was a perfectionist. She did give me pricing on the specialized bling cake stand and sugar flowers I initially wanted, but when I found out the cost I ultimately felt it was not worth the money. It was very expensive but giving them the benefit of the doubt, I do believe other cake companies would have been expensive too for the items I requested. I have seen pictures of their work and I am sure it would have been beautiful if I spent more money.   I did express that I wanted real flowers instead to be placed all along the cake and I showed a picture of the draping flower look I wanted. The top of the cake was filled with real flowers. The rest of the cake had 1 rose on the bottom layer and 0 roses on the middle layer. It's been so long I can't remember if this was their responsibility to add the flowers or the florist's responsibility, but whoever it was did not give me the amount of flowers they had made it seem I would get.   The taste of the cake was 5 stars. I usually am not a fan of wedding cakes but this was moist and delicious. After the wedding we ate the top layer with our family the next day and we really enjoyed it."}

{"bus_id":"_6hReDyVSr94W2WMO1LJLw", "text":"I live in Lakewood part of the time and used to patronize the Phoenix.  The Phoenix has now morphed into the Root Cafe, located two doors from the old Phoenix location and in a bigger space.  Even though I liked the Phoenix, the Root is a significant improvement because:  1)  The larger space is much more comfortable than the old Phoenix, which had almost no room for live musicians and often made you feel like you were sitting in your neighbor's lap - I usually ended up getting my coffee 'to go'.  The new place has more room to sit, more wall space to display art, more room for a stage on which live music takes place a couple times a week, and more space for waiting at the counter and deciding what you want.   2)  The new location of the Root, which takes up two storefronts and is proximious to the lawn of another building going around the corner, provides more parking options (since you can park on the side street and have an easy walk round the corner to the place) and also has eased some of the congestion caused by people wanting to hang out, smoke, etc. in front of the building.  I am not against kids hanging out in front of coffee shops or people smoking outside them - in fact, I tend to regard hanger-outers as the sign of a good coffee shop.  However, the previous location mid-block only had a small space for these folks to congregate and at times, trying to get into the store for your coffee was like pushing through a concert crowd.    The Root serves all the same great coffee and even some beer.  It's very awesome to be able to have a beer without needing to be in either a noisy bar (Lakewood already has about 125215 bars) or a sit-down restaurant.  I understand there is also more food available, though I have yet to try it.    My only complaint is that on show nights, they should find some way to allow the people who are truly interested in the music to sit or stand closer to the stage.  It's disconcerting to go down there specifically to see your friend play and find every table occupied by people who are chatting with friends or using the wi-fi to check their Facebooks and seemingly couldn't care less about the musician playing a set, while the 5-15 people who stopped by specifically to see the music show have to sit way in the back because there isn't any place closer."}

The sign said to go inside and get a hostess to seat us, so my boyfriend went inside while I waited. I guess they were too busy inside to even answer his question. The woman told him that she would be 'right' with him, but we waited for ten minutes. I'm guessing she forgot about him even though he was standing right there, so he went up to her again and asked about being seated. When she finally got to him, she told him that we could sit wherever we'd like. It's pretty confusing for people who haven't been there before. I also agree with a previous reviewer, it would be a lot easier if they took our order at our table.  My boyfriend and I split the caprese sandwich and New Mexico burrito (minus the bacon). Really good. Their salsa was the best that I've had. I had an iced Nutella mocha and my boyfriend had a hot one. We both liked our drinks although I didn't really taste the Nutella.

My friend suggested to get the special which was a Black Diamond Black Milk Tea with grass jelly, red beans and tapioca pearls for $4.19. Wanted to order their Sweet milk custard brick toast but the cashier warned us that it would take 10-15 minutes to prepare so I went with the Fried Spiced Chicken instead.   There was a bit of a wait time but not unusually long. The flavor and sweetness of the tea was fine (you can adjust the level of sweetness and amount of ice in your drink ) but it tasted very powdery like they used powdered coffee creamer. The tapioca pearls were soft with a nice chew, the way I like it. I was expecting the Fried Spiced Chicken to be spicy (hot) with a crispy  coating but they weren't. However, they were tender, juicy flavorful bite size morsels of chicken.  If I was in the area again I would come back to try more of their food.

I recognize the owners as I believe one is from Nadege and the other from Voodoo Child. The space is really nice - spacious, modern, light, extremely clean and chill. It has a slightly exposed, industrial vibe with lots of concrete and wood. I like combo of cute, tiny single tables up the front (something different) and booths and a communal table up the back.  They serve all your well known favourites - lattes, americanos, espresso, flat whites, cortados and pour over. They use De Mello Palheta beans which gives a strong and velvety coffee and non dairy milk offerings include almond, coconut and cashew (hipster on fleek right there). They also have a Japanese, matcha kinda thing going on with their baked goods, all of which look absolutely stunning (I guess I'd expect nothing less from a Nadege alum).  I think this would be a nice place to work during the day. They have free wi-fi and there were some people there with laptops so I'd assume there must be some outlets around. The staff are very friendly but definitely without haste.   One barista impressed me with her recommendations of different non-dairy milks for different coffees based on their sweetness and frothiness. Based on signage they have won a few latte art awards. The latte art on my almond latte wasn't all that but it's harder to do. Only a few places around can pull of something exceptional with that material (Riddle Room, M Square, some people at Dineen).  Tip: To save you some awkwardness - the bathroom really is past the back wall and not downstairs like it would seem. The subtle sign they have doesn't really do the trick because the door almost completely blends in with the wall. But, evidently, if you push on it a discrete washroom appears as if from nowhere."}

I've tried many of their hot beverage and I would highly recommend their Smokeaccino or their Beet Mint. Warning!! They are both delicious and you might finish them in a jiffy. The Smokeaccino has a smokey and cappuccino fused flavour. The Beet Mint has a unique blend of beet and mint and is non caffeinated if you are looking for a decaffeinated option.

I needed a place to study away from the boringness of the ASU library so I ventured out to Drip.  I had that warm, 'yea!  A cute coffee house that isn't crowded' feeling as I walked up to the bar to order.  Gina, I presume, was very nice and I ordered a latte and frittata and took my seat at a cute table facing the street.  I happen to love the color orange- and it is everywhere in Drip... ah, contentment.    I turned on my laptop and patiently waited for the food.  Drink came out quickly.  I noticed that wi-fi didn't connect automatically so I waited a few minutes for the waitress.  It seemed like it took a little longer than norm for the food to come out.  As she walked over, the frittata looked amazing as did the toast.  She set my plate down and I asked her if Drip offered wi-fi.  Her cold reply, 'no. sorry.'  WHAT!!!  And after reading all of these great reviews that the coffeehouse does, I'm completely annoyed... even more so.  That is just so odd to me.    So, needless to say, I had to pack up and leave and here I am- in the boring library listening to some cute (yet incredibly annoying) nerds go over a chemistry mid-term.  Exactly what I set out to avoid today... ugh.  Buuuuttttt... the food was great.  I loved the frittata and the coffee was great.  The other downfall, the frittata was $8 I believe- I think it should have been about $6 and the cute cup of coffee was about $5, should have been about $3.50 or so.    Not sure if I'll return, it'll probably be awhile.  High hopes shot down about the wi-fi... maybe I'll have a better outlook when I'm out of this basement!"}

Plus I love that they come in glass, the taste is so much crisper in the glass as with any drink. The store is very clean and well kept on the daily.  The prices are a little on the higher side, but I don't mind paying a little more for good quality cold pressed juice. If you go 2 hours before closing they have a happy hour deal for 10% off which is when I go to grab my juices and açaí bowls. Ohh and what can I say about the açaí bowls, they taste so darn good and I'm going to go and say that this is the best açaí bowl I have ever tasted. They got the mix and ingredients down to a T. Lots of other places can do it how they do, sometimes it is to watery or too icy.

Figures. So in we went. This place is mad small and the three more appealing tables were full. We ended up sitting at one of the four or so tables jammed together at the front of the place. A good portion of the floor space was taken up by kegs and cases of beer. This seemed pretty silly considering space here is at a premium, but who knows? Maybe they didn't have time to put away a delivery yet because they suddenly got busy. Giving the benefit of the doubt.

The COCOA TEA O-M-G. I bought a bag and it lasted less than a week. Perfect for the season!  I am willing to spend money on their matchas and more of the cocoa tea. It's basically cocoa shells, I suggest mixing it with a base tea, and adding some milk to get a delicious tea latte. But if you want a skinny hot cocoa, just make a tea of cocoa shells and pour some steamed milk on top, IT ACTUALLY TASTES BETTER THAN CARNATION, I SWEAR.   They could be better, though: they could offer more tea accessories (the basics: paper filters, tea tumblers...) and it's very small, so you will probably order tea-to-go.

Cafe Neon is popular... even on a weekday lunch, you can find this spot quite filled up and on a weekend, I've been told that the wait is easily 30+ minutes. Though it is not a big spot, you can find a table of 4 still works in the back.  Another plus of this spot is that the front does coffees to go... I didnt give it a shot (I had a great flat white further west at Major Treat), it's a spot I can try out next time.  Most of the seating is behind in another room and the coffee take out area is in front.  I got lucky and was seated quickly in a super cozy spot.  I think most people would not like it as it was just stool seating in the front window.  For me, it works as I got to dog and people watch while eating my lunch.  The place is really low key and casual... its not hipsterish but I could easily see other people suggest it is.  I would say it's more of a casual local and low key spot.  The service here is a bit ... scattered and not because they didnt care but because all tables were super filled and they were trying to move the tables quickly.  They're nice but just really busy.  We got our order in but we did wait a bit long seeing how we ordered the vegetarian seasonal salad bowl and a soup & sandwich.  I would say the kitchen was probably just trying to push so many orders out.  Seasonal Bowl (Vegetarian) - I saw another person said this was flavourless so I was worried ordering this.  I think my bowl was far better than theirs then.  Mine was nicely dressed with a light vinaigrette and there was a ton of variety of vegetables.  Sprouted grains, rocket, green sprouts, beets, kale, sweet potato, almonds ... the list goes on.  It was a BIG and brightly coloured salad... Loved the variety and did I say it was BIG?  HUGE.  Great portion for the costs... one of the better ones for this side of Toronto.  Did I like it more than Veghed or The Goods which is nearby?  No... not quite.  It was just missing a flavour wow compared to the other 2.  THOUGH I would have no problems ordering this any time.  3.5/5  Pulled Pork Sandwich - This one was far more smokier than I was expecting out of a little cafe... and that's not a bad thing.  It was tender pork that had a good smokey flavour.  How do they do it without a smoker?  I dunno but it was a good sandwich especially with the onion bread, chipotle mayo, slaw, and coffee bbq sauce.  The sandwich bun seemed a bit smaller but it's under $10.  Can't really complain for Toronto.   4/5  Mushroom Soup - A really nice bowl who's flavour looks far better than looks. It looks more like a murkish grey puddle. With a lot of chopped mushrooms in it, it was very savoury and had tons of bold flavour.  I felt the chef probably was heavy handed with the black pepper so it was probably a bit too much spice to it than I would have liked.  Still an enjoyable soup.  3.5/5  Overall, this is a great spot to try if you're in the area and looking for a solid and affordable meal.  There's a decent amount of options for vegans, vegetarians, and omnivores so you can always find something.  Just be a bit patient for the food and all would be fine."}

Images of their signature croquant chou pastry were plastered along the wall and explained the concept and how it is prepared and best enjoyed.   While I understand that croquant chou style cream puffs are the current hype in Harujuku, I found that the claim of Japanese style cafe confusing as it the cafe also offers bingsu on their menu along with standard coffee and tea based beverages. Despite the fact that I was the only customer in the store at 4pm on a Friday afternoon, I perceived a bit of hesitation or delay in the staff mobilizing to offer service.   I ordered a matcha latte. The brightly coloured cups are eye catching and featured an ostrich as part of their logo. I asked for a regular sized cup but was surprised that it was smaller than most standard cups. The matcha flavour was notable but overall the latte was watery and lacked a creaminess that I've enjoyed with matcha lattes elsewhere in the city.   So what exactly is a croquant chou mukimuki? It is a long eclair shaped cream puff with a crunchy nutty coating and filled upon ordering with a light pastry cream. The pastry cream is milky but not overly heavy, which could be dangerous as I could potentially see myself eating a few of these delicious pastries. The deterring factor would be the cost. I felt that the croquant chou was somewhat overpriced at nearly $7. Despite the cost and mediocre first experience, I'd probably come back for the croquant chou pastry and perhaps to try something other than the matcha latte."}

Their professionalism, Product Quality, artistic Skill, and Customer Service definitely can't be beat! Joe and the rest of their team were Amazing! Some may say custom cakes are pricey and they are but like anything else you get what you pay for! Everyone was in Awe when they seen her cake and said how amazing and delicious it was. BTW it was a two tier Strawberry cake with Strawberry Mousse Filling. In the end all I can say is I was more than satisfied and the cake was definitely worth the price and most of all the look on my friends face was PRICELESS! If you are looking for the BEST Custom cake this is the place to go! Give them a call you won't be disappointed!!"}

The major factor playing a role in what makes this bagel different if you can notice at all is the the fact that you can grab it straight out of oven unlike Starbucks or Tim Hortons which have to be delivered and reheated.    In conclusion, if this is the best that bagels can be I would say it's worth a go just to say you've been there, done that but don't expect something you've never experienced before.

Popcorn chicken is very much like the kind you would get in a Taiwan night market.  Chicken was very tasty.

I was looking forward to my first visit!  When I pulled into the parking lot, however, I realized then that I *had* been here before, just over a year ago, in the first month after I moved to Vegas. Many coffee houses have since been experienced in this city, but Darak remained forgettable. The coffee I had that day, a mocha, wasn't horrible, or I would have remembered the place, or written a 1-star review.  But, desperate as I was this evening, I plowed forward.  And got an oreo cheesecake.   For $5, it was utterly disappointing, a waste of cash and calories. Almost devoid of taste, it absorbed some of the flavor and texture of the styrofoam container it was absently dropped into, like a red-headed stepcheesecake. Was this purchased at Smith's and resold? Just blah. Despite sitting out for over an hour, it was dense and dry. Did they use hard cheese to make it? A cheesecake is supposed to be soft.  Moist. Flavorful, like a divine...well, cheesecake.   None of that.  So the end. I won't be back. I know some people enjoy the kitchy environment here, but I'm a 37yr-old male who feels like he just walked into a Japanese teenie-bopper's dorm room.

The quesadilla was a bit better, but still the jalapeño marmalade was way too sweet without the kick of heat needed to balance it out.

Great selection of cream cheese spreads (lox being my favorite). Bagels are cooked perfectly and the perfect amount of chewy! It is so hard for me to get the perfect bagel after being spoiled growing up eating good bagels from LA. This bagel is a match to what I grew up with. They also have really friendly service although a bit rushed.   I appreciate the sugar free rugelach and the large cookie and sweets selection. I do love the chocolate rugelach the most. Not too sweet. I think their corned beef is really good unlike other places in town that it is dry. It's not cheap though.

YAY it's the manager working at the bar, finally a familiar face. She was as confused as i was about the situation.  girl- 'well i don't want to give them a double discount, a punch in the card and a free drink'   At this point i just space out because this is the most ridiculousness i have heard. NO WHERE does that,  or acts like that...let alone in front of a customer. Granted i did not say anything else and just got my drink and left.

They have lots of pizzas, sandwiches, salads, and wines. They also have a lovely dessert case ! In general, a great selection.  I ordered the chicken pesto sandwich, and my friend ordered a half sandwich of the same and tortilla soup. The sandwich was delicious! It had slices of chicken instead of chunks, which was something I always appreciate. It came with cheese, pesto, artichoke hearts, red peppers, and tomatoes. It came on toasted bread and came with a little scoop of potato salad. The sandwich was tangy and savory! The potato salad was very light and had a unique blend of flavors. My friend's soup had a lot of flavor without being overwhelmingly spicy. Overall, our dinner was delightful!  We were also drawn by the dessert case. I planned on getting a cookie because they looked so soft, but we ended up with the brownie. And it was the right choice. It was absolutely one of the best brownies I have ever had! It was sticky and fudgy, and had a chewy bottom. It was almost cake like in texture. I highly recommend it!! If you're nice, you might convince them to warm it up and give you a drizzle of caramel and chocolate on top. It was awesome!!  Thanks for the excellent food, experience, and service.

The Oreo cupcake on the other hand was dry and tasted as though it had been there for a couple days. At over four dollars a cupcake I really expected much better than we received.  They had many other flavors to choose from; however, based on the experience I had with the Oreo cupcake they've lost my trust."}

You may have to wait a little, but you know you are getting the absolute freshest they have. Their staff is friendly and super helpful. The sandwiches and wraps are tasty (available in a half or full sandwich option) and they come with a side of pasta salad. The appetizers are also very well done and also have a full and half order option. My group tried the onion rings, fried pickles and fried pepperoni. The batter on the onion rings is perfect, not too doughy and crisp without falling off the onion. The pickles are a fried breading and have a bit of a kick. The fried pepperoni is amazing and addicting.  It is the perfect crispness of bacon with the pepperoni flavor and not very greasy. It came with a spicy dipping sauce, but I prefer the ranch for these."}

Very friendly staff and wholesome yummy pastries with a touch of Asian flavors, including not being overly sweet and having matcha flavors.

I personally didn't drink their coffee (friend had the cappuccino) so can't comment on that, but I really enjoyed their earl gray roll cake and yogurt parfait. The yogurt parfait was again not overly sweet like Tim Horton's parfaits and you could actually appreciate the fresh taste of the fruits and granola components.  Downsides: not enough seating and lack of outlets (?), kind of dark towards the back of the cafe since not enough natural lighting, chairs were uncomfortably hard  Price: 4/5 Ambiance and space: 3.5/5, pretty quiet so good for working but where are the outlets?

{"bus_id":"GCRnrQtGOQ8ugofVbgrS-w", "text":"My wife was super excited when she saw the historic building housing this bakery and cafe. Two stars mostly for price, and limited selection for a spot that bills itself as a bakery. The items on offer were pretty tasty, but neither old fashioned farm style, nor particularly fancy for a shop run by CRMR, and two items cost $7+.  This price tag would be easier to swallow if the nondescript interior of the shop had a rustic atmosphere, like the heritage building that houses it.  Two stars is a bit harsh, I realize it's tough to make a profitable seasonal business out of such a venture, but I was disappointed after going out of the way to try it out. A more apt name like Annie's Snack Shack would set expectations appropriately, and adding a few rustic touches would set the mood better."}

I had the Bo Lo Bao (pineapple bun) with half butter (love that they offer a lighter version, for 25 cents cheaper too!) but was disappointed because I think they just microwaved the bun to heat it up then put butter in it. This pretty much ruined the texture and flavour of the bun. :(  I also had the hot Yuen Yang (half coffee half milk tea) which was good, I like that the coffee wasn't too acidic but complimented the milk tea well. I've had better but this is one of the best I've had in Toronto.   I got two other buns for takeout and I agree with other reviewers in that they are pricy ($1.95/bun) but the quality is definitely more superior than other Chinese bakeries in the GTA.   I think this is a very good cafe to sit down and enjoy your food without feeling rushed if you can find a seat. The atmosphere is wonderful and I would definitely come back if I am meeting up with a friend or waiting for someone. I'd recommend skipping if you are only here for food as you will probably be disappointed.   P.S. They charge 25 cents to use interac debit; No visa."}

How this place works is you order and receive your items at the counter- if you'd like to sit down, they have designated tables within their enclosed area (roughly seats 20 people), so you don't need to fight for tables in the FCP food court.   I ordered the quiche and salad combo, which came out to approx $12.50. Both were amazing- the salad is similar to what you can get from somewhere like iQ next door, but just without any protein. Dressing also served on the side (unlike Pumpernickel's pre-dressed salads). All in all, a great deal for lunch items."}

The inside was huge and I'm glad that a local place like this was so full when I went for a late lunch around 1:30pm. The wait staff was slow but again pretty true to NY style in that part.    The corned beef was very good but not fatty enough for my liking. The pickle eh. The matzo ball soup was quite good - very hearty. I thought the bagel greatly underwhelmed as the place is called Bagel Cafe.   For $11 a meal the price seems high. Yes there's a lot of meat but honestly it's not as much as you'd expect for the price. Usually they are stacked double high (maybe $3-4 more but worthy of two meals). I was full but there was definitely not enough for a second meal. I would give Bagel Cafe a try if you're nostalgic for a NY deli, but don't expect the authentic experience.

I'm pretty sure that's a word. It still may be during the day, but I didn't get that feel at all after walking in the door. My intention was to merely purchase a coffee and research what Montreal really has to offer - which is a lot.  I was greeted right away, and sat at the bar. After realizing I wasn't going to get any research done here I decided to stick around and see what was offered on the menu.  I opted for the Bison dish with figue, mache, airelle and cameline - whatever those are. I wasn't asked how I would like to have it cooked, so I guess it just comes standard as medium rare, which is just how I prefer it. The Bison itself was delicious and tender, though it was a 'half serving'. The figue portion of the dish I could have done without, as I was never a fan of the newton variety anyway, even as a kid.  I spoke in length with the host, bartender and chef about 'must dos' while in MTL, and they were VERY helpful with their insight and suggestions. We even touched on the debate on which sandwich and bagel shop truly has the heart of Quebecians.   Cafe Sardine definitely have a great staff and a nice intimate ambience, which was the deciding factor in the 4th star. I really dig their hardwood floors too.

Two of us had the Lobster Bisque. Ok we are in Wisconsin, I wasn't expecting much. It was great! Smooth creamy and actually had Lobster in it! The other four salads. No complaints on the salads, simple side type salad. For our entrees we had a bit of a mix. I had ribs and coconut shrimp. I've read a lot of the reviews here about the ribs. Seems unfair to criticize when rib preparation preference is very wide. Personally I thought they were great! Did they fall off the bone? No but they shouldn't either. Some people like them like mush and that is fine but I'll take a little firmness. These ribs that night came off the bone clean with a slight tug. Great texture and dark smoky bark. Coconut shrimp were a tasty compliment. Others had catfish they really enjoyed. Not like in Texas with small curled pieces but actually corn meal battered filets. The pulled pork was awesome! Here too, not what you usually get with pulled pork. This was nice long strings with some texture, sauce free, with your choice of 4 on the table. Not that mashed up pile of meat buried in sauce that you can't tell what you are eating. Brisket beans were very good and meaty. Hush Puppies were straight out of the South, very good. The prices I thought were very reasonable. We were shocked how low our bill was for 6. We were out of there with two drinks each and 20% tip for under $190 and we were stuffed! We can't wait to go back!"}

The plucky aviator motif is an apt one to be sure, given the elevating potency of the brews on-hand (the Joe Maxx Mocha is described as 'loaded with tons of chocolate...and caffeine.'), ditto their sugar-buzz inducing counterparts gleaming up out of the pastry case. The other day families and students alike crowded the three or four tables (not a lot of room to spread out here at JM), munching on delightful, flakey, fresh-baked croissants, and sipping specialty coffee drinks by the gallon. The dirty chai latte was a fan favorite: an expert amalgam of savory and spicy, it might just make you believe in a kona deity, or at the very least satisfy a craving for fall flavor once you've burned yourself out on a certain ubiquitous chain's pumpkin spice. Your reviewer nearly broke his neck trying to read the menu board, however, which looms at a precarious angle high above the counter. A curious design choice, to be certain. Menu aside though, Joe Maxx is an accomplished little shop. Cozy, clean, and staffed by chatty, unpretentious baristas.

The green tea mousse cake was unique and very flavorful. So for you green tea lovers out there, this maybe your birthday destination. The tiramisu mousse cake is layers of espresso, cream, and cake goodness. When you get a cake to go, the sturdy and stylish boxes comes with handles to ensure easy transport. The lady that works there is always quick to greet you with a warm smile and is happy to help. She is always patient in answering my questions about what the item is and what it tastes like. She also makes sure the displays are very neat and orderly. The pride in her shop makes me happy to purchase my dessert treats here as I know she cares about the products she puts out.   The cakes and goodies here are generally not cloying sweet, but they hit that sugar spot when you need it. There are thick sliced bread sold as a loaf-good for honey toast she explained and a popular sell for her store. There is a community table when you walk in and some sitting area if you want to just sit and enjoy your pastry with some coffee or tea. Each time I have been there, people from all age groups have communed there to just hang out and they all seem to have a good time.  This bakery has a lot of Asian sweet breads and treats with very affordable pricing. The middle and side tables have individual goods to go. Items I have also tried are fried mochi, donut filled with sweet red bean paste, honey cake slices, honey cake slice with puff pastry in the middle (that's in the fridge case with the cakes), pull apart bread (labeled 15 C) with vanilla cream and raisin in the middle, and hot dog bun. The hot dog bun is a savory sweet item new to the menu along with pizza bun. The hot dog was wrapped around a croissant like bread, but not as crumbly, and had a little ketchup drizzle on top baked in. It was actually pretty good. The honey cake with puff pastry on the middle was a crowd pleaser as it had just enough honey taste to live up to its name, but not too much where it was cloying. The 15C pull apart bread was a well received as it was soft and the vanilla cream was sweet. The raisins in the cream filling was a  hit and miss with some people. The edge of the bread did not have as much cream as the middle, but not a big deal. They also have cups of green tea and chocolate mousse that I look forward to trying as well. Be sure to check out the macaroons by the display case too! They have fruit flavored and Hello Kitty variety in packages of four.  For the quality and freshness of the baked goods I find this place a real treat to try something new each time. Real care is taken into every purchase I make no matter how big or small. From the packaging to ringing me up, the goods are never thrown into a bag or hurried out. Small plastic cake knives are offered when I forget to ask in case I need it. Truly a delight to treat yourself and to be treated just as well. Highly recommend."}

One of my biggest pet peeves is an 'open' store that's not really open... might as well be closed right?!  I went to this location with my wife with hopes to have my sweet tooth satisfied, but was disappointed due to this experience.

Luckily we were only 2 and they were able to literally squeeze us in which later made it hard for us and others to get in a a out of our seats. But once seated it was cozy and comfortable. There was also shade which was nice.   Only seemed to be one waiter and he was running around. It took him some time to get our order & he was abrupt (had that French attitude). I ordered a latte and it came quickly in a tall glass and was perfect!   I also ordered eggs Benny which took a long time to come. We had to mention that we had ordered some time ago when a staff member came by.   The table next to us was also waiting for quite some time and they got a free pastry (we did not and I was disappointed).   Overall the food was good and the patio was lovely albeit tight fit.   The decor inside which I only saw when I went to use the bathroom was so charming and made me think of a Parisian cafe. But I was glad not to be sitting inside on such a hot day as they didn't seem to have the a/c on. Perhaps because it's an old house that has been repurposed?

Great ones to try  - Coconut snow - Thai tea slush - Taro milk tea - Honey green milk tea - Lychee milk tea - Jasmine milk tea  The only thing I can't recommend is the food. It is not good. Everything is fried and it all tastes the same: bland."}

I just happen to be in a bagel kind of mood start the day so figure perfect opportunity for some yelping.   Talk about bagels, bagels, and not just bagels. I had no idea since this was my first visit. It felt like almost whole deli section in major chain grocery store. One section that has all kinds of bagels in wire baskets choose from everything and anything can imagine. Each basket is well label and LOVE the way all the sections are displayed for the customers. Clean glass display, clear easy to read labels, and everything looks fresh. The selection of cream cheese again just about had everything and everything can imagine. I ended up going on safer play sun dried tomato bagel with regular cream cheese. Toast the bagel coast you dollar extra find odd. It was awesome bagel. The cream cheese was solid. The veggie cream cheese was looking awesome just wanted stay neutral flavor and enjoy the bagel. In the same section had assortment of cold salads can choose from. On the right have deli section with cheeses, deli meats, and not often seen in deli sections had couple dried fish or smoked fish looked like could get. The dessert section!!!! The biggest section of all of them. Really nothing that I would not pass up to try. I was just in bagel kind of mood.   The restaurant area itself is decent size with counter area. Looks and feel like local coffee shop decor. I just got bagel to go so have no idea about the service or anything about the restaurant. Not doubt if in breakfast mood The Bagel Cafe is solid choice start the day!!!"}

They have the best scones I have ever tried in Phoenix (and I have tried A LOT). Although I love Luxe also, their scones are nowhere near as moist as Urban Beans!!! All that being said, I tried a gluten free scone last week and it was awful. It literally tasted like cardboard- at least how I imagine cardboard would taste!!  Unfortunately, on the same visit the order taker wasn't paying close attention to my order and so I got a latte that was wasaayyyy sweeter than I like. I hope Urban Beans reads these reviews because their order takers (at the counter) could use some improvement- friendliness and details.  All that is very minor when considered with the whole picture. And I would whole heartedly recommend this place to my fellow picky espresso drinkers out there!"}

Definitely coming back to try the hot Cheeto nachos fries.  The draw backs : we waited more than an hour for three drinks, the other two were not as great as the coffee horchata and a little disappointing. The flavors didn't mix as well and the Tajin was overbearing. By the time we got there at 9pm they have run out of hot Cheetos and couldn't making the items on the menu that contained hot Cheetos.

I love this location, you can sit in and enjoy your tea and people watch outside the large windows.  During the winter the Don Mills shops have a little skating rink made up right outside this place, which really makes your people watching even better!  Service is usually always pretty good and they have free wi-fi, so you can come here and do your work or surf the net in between staring out the window.  Lots of gifty items available here as well, I got my first loose leaf mug here (and travel mug from the same chain in Calgary - I was excited to find them out here now as well!).

After skimming through the menu, I decided on the superfood 'Good' smoothie which came with banana, blackberry, wild blueberries, coconut milk, and chia seeds. It took about 12-15 minutes to place and receive my order.   My smoothie was alright. Nothing spectacular, but nothing to complain about either. The best part about it was that it was a healthy, guilt-free food decision! I totally needed that after the binge eating I had been doing on my trip!

Lordy, I was a happy woman!  The hash was made in house, and some of the best I've ever had. A little salty, but in a good way. My eggs were cooked PERFECTLY! Basted medium. Whites cooked, yolk making a nice runny sauce for the hash. Ketchup and hot sauce were available, but not needed.  Those bacon studded pancakes were CRAZY good.

The dingy strip mall surrounding the restaurant is a real eyesore, but they do an admirable job of creating your own little oasis in the cement.  They are pet friendly which makes it great for a Sunday morning bike ride with the pooch (the bloody Mary will knock you off your seat).  Be prepared to sweat. It is REALLY warm inside during the summer months.  The patio is cozy, covered & there is a mist system, but being surrounded by a huge mass of concrete diminishes the cooling effects.

The sort of place where I might have sneaked into to have elaborate tea parties as a child. It's a nice sense of whimsy.  There is an extensive tea list, many of which are interesting herbal mixes named after times and places (Wild West is my favorite). I used to buy the dry tea from them years ago, but I don't think they sell it like that anymore.  The food is always great and often creative, with ample portions.  It's definitely starch-heavy though, with most of the dishes being based around sandwich bread, pasta or rice, and I haven't recently been there to find out if substitutions (like salad instead of rice) are ok.

The wait staff is very nice if a little busy but they very good about accommodating you as quickly as they can. If you don't like crowds you can get your order to go.   Guaranteed there is something for everyone since they have a large drink menu. I haven't eaten anything there but my friends all like it and order something whenever we go.

The food itself is well known as high quality and it does not upset. The char siu bao (roast pork bun) has nice chunks and doesn't have a weird red look.  The steamed rice is the same as other locations in taste but here it seems they make you order as a combo with drink whereas I remember other locations I can just get the steamed rice.  The prices in general for buns is more expensive than other places. Think $1.75-$2.25 for each.  They also don't take credit card. I get it you still Chinese but you gotta accept credit card in this day in age. And if you use Interac, they charge $0.25 each transaction.  Fact they are already a bit more expensive than others and they surcharge Interac and no credit, I docked a couple stars."}

There is the option of half butter which is enough for me, but I think most people go for the full butter. The milk tea is nice and strong in flavour and pairs with the pineapple bun perfectly.

{"bus_id":"wyInknn19SE7IxeHrraBew", "text":"The South Scottsdale area is sadly void of decent breakfast options. There are a few who do nice job, but not enough to keep the rotation fresh. I was greatly hoping that BACON would add another much needed breakfast boit to my mix. Sadly, after 3 tries that just isn't the case.   I will try to avoid snarkyness, but this place misses on way too many points. Beginning with decor, the denim booth covers are certainly a matter of taste, not mine, but enough of my friends think that it is cute and unique that I will have to forgoe critcism. The open airy layout seems to just miss, and as with many new concepts there seems to be an identity crisis. Restaurant? Coffee shop? The place is cute enough to forgive a little confusion if redemption could be found in the food and service.   First major problem, 2 of my 3 visits, the place named Bacon had no candadian bacon ????? The food in general is bland and uninviting, highlited by breakfast potatos that have a strange glaze or gravy that I do not quite understand.   Lastly the service, its ok - probably 3 stars for pleasant, but back down to 2 for performance, Twice I had to get up for silverware before I could begin eating, and things do seem to take a while. I promised I would not be snarky so I am leaving out critical details. Trust me or not, a great many faux pas are a regular part of the dining experience.   Bacon is the type of place I really want to do well, both for selfish and altruistic reasons, but I don't see this place having the core to climb out of these early snafus to be a decent place. It has been open long enough to make have made some strides by now. I will keep rooting for them from afar."}

The sandwich was supposed to come with an English muffin but I actually think I was given a bagel. When you're trying to watch your carb intake, it was just too much bread.

Their cannolis came in regular and large sizes - of course we wanted the large size and it seems most customers do since one of the staff offered to make large ones for me since there weren't any left in the display case. The cannolis were delicious - crispy shell filled with luscious cream that wasn't too sweet. Even my non-dessert craving husband really enjoyed them!  Their arancini meatballs were also delicious, even though we had them the next day for lunch. It was stuffed generously with rice, meat, some veggies and savoury tomato sauce.

First you have to choose your base (brownie or waffle); ice-cream (vanilla or earl-grey); sauce (chocolate or vanilla) and finally the toppings (fruits, brownie bites, crushed nuts etc). The portion is quite generous for the price.   I ordered the hot-plate with waffle and my friend got the brownie one.   The iron plate is heated until it is boiling hot, then the chef would put the base and all the toppings on top. All you have to do is to pour the sauce around the base and you will start to see some steam and sizzle! I wished there was more variation of fruits and extra fruit pieces. To be honest, while the effect was 'cool,' I don't understand the purpose of the iron plate.   The waffle wasn't that great, it was too dense and chewy for my taste. Likewise the brownie was just like other brownie I have had. If you ask me, I think the iron-plate should be heated longer so then the heat will cook the bases, and give them a slight crust on the outside. The good thing about these desserts was that all the components weren't too sweet, and the bitter dark chocolate helped to balance the sweetness of the dishes.  *Overall: I would visit again once they have finalized their menu. As the owners are still in the menu-testing phase, there are rooms for improvement in terms of the offerings and quality of the dishes. Also, most items were decently priced for the amount and taste of food, it doesn't hurt to try if you are in the area to grab chatime  :p."}

It was a really good cake and nothing was wrong with it. Everything went according to plan. It was a little bit overpriced but it was cute so I don't care.  The next month in June however was a totally different  story. It was my son's 5th birthday this time and since I liked the cake I was hoping to get another cake from them for his 5th birthday. I place an order over the phone for June 24th it was on a Wednesday. (my son loves Spiderman so I ordered him a Spiderman cake)   The lady who took my order which I don't know her name confirmed everything with me and told me it will be ready in the morning of June 24th. My husband goes there that morning and they told him that the cake won't be ready till Friday. Which I don't understand because I ordered it for Wednesday.   The lady in charge told me there must have been a miscommunication, that i gave her the wrong date..... (because you know i dont know my sons birthday....) and said nothing else. She was actually quite rude about it while I was on the phone with her she was taking orders from other people who were in line at her store and put me on hold four times.  When it was convenient for her to actually talk to me the only thing that she could offer me was either a refund or only 10 percent off on some cupcakes.   I was devastated because this was my 5 year old son's birthday and I didn't want him to not have a cake. I asked her about the cupcakes and if we could make them spiderman themed with some fondant cutouts or something and she told me that she could only do basic cupcakes a regular vanilla cupcake with some red and blue frosting...   I couldn't believe it first you make the mistake of putting the wrong date on my order and then you're going to offer me only 10 percent off for some basic cupcakes and won't even take the time to add a couple of fondant cut outs or something to make them more Spiderman themed?  I said screw it and ask for a refund and the refund didn't even come to me until a WEEK later so let's say for example if I didn't have the money to get another cake my son would have not had a birthday cake.

Deep fried, lightly crispy on the outside and slightly eggy and moist plus the filling Taro custard. Oh so good.    Also the shave ice they make here is my favorite. Pat Bing Soo sp? or  PatBingSu? It's shave ice dessert Korean style!  I like it better because they use fresh fruit as opposed to the jarred fruit used for Filipino Halo Halo.  Today I got the Green Tea Shave ice. Matcha Green Tea powder and Green Tea ice cream, red beans, fresh fruit and  sweet condensed milk topped the shaved ice. So good!  The employees are always super nice.

Beautiful and attractive appearance.  The crepe was thinly made, soft and smooth; it had perfect texture and tasted light.  The matcha green tea was amazing.  It had a strong green tea flavour and was not sweet, true and real to taste.  Not much red bean and sponge cake were found in the crepe, so I was somewhat disappointed.  The crepe is a 'individualized' or 'separated' version of a matcha red bean chiffon cake.  Nothing can go wrong with the combination of these ingredients; they are made for each other!  Nevertheless, it was still scrumptious.  Regular sized Hazelnut Flavoured Latte ($4.89) was HUGE!  The drink had very strong hazelnut flavour and sprinkled with real hazelnut bits.  Very legitimate~  The frothy hot milk was very fun to drink.  It felt like a bubble bath, blowing the bubbles and giggles everywhere.  This latte was that enjoyable."}

The weather was fantastic at the time, so the wait was very bearable.  Orders were taken after a few questions were asked, and they had a generous buy one get one offer at the time. I ordered a Lychee Crush and a Peach Blossom.  To be perfectly honest, the Peach Blossom was quite good but the Lychee Crush was pretty terrible. My friend had one as well, and their Lychee Crush tasted much better. Inconsistency is a big issue to me when it comes to drinks, especially if they generally cost 5 dollars or more. I imagine they'd probably fix it, but I had finished it before trying my friend's (who also got the buy 1 get 1 and saved it for last).  Prices are on the higher end for a drink place, especially if you get some of the add-ons. But at the same time, they have a lot of unique drinks that you won't find anywhere else. I haven't found one that I actually like enough to go back (I tried about 5 different drinks), but I'm sure a lot of people will appreciate their flair and variety."}

The outside has padded wicker furniture inviting you to sip some espresso while reading a good book. The gentlemen behind the bar were busy cranking out drinks for their drive thru customers but did stop to greet me and take my order, a small almond milk latte.   I planned on enjoying the coffee in house but the employee walked the drink out to me in a to-go cup. The cup was 1/4 foam which was super bubbly and also fell about 1/2 inch below the rim of the cup. It also tasted like raspberry syrup. Maybe they didn't rinse the pitcher while steaming the milk? Not sure. They were kind enough to remake my drink but it came back to me with the same result.   Mad House isn't cheap and for the price I expect a higher quality of drink. The venue is totally welcoming and somewhere I could see myself hanging out but I came for the coffee. Fingers crossed for a better experience if I make my way back."}

It should be flaky, delicate, sweet and tempt you to eat the entire perimeter [to really piss off your family].  Whatever the dry, flavorless stuff was that held this thing together might as well have been cardboard.      I got an apple pie, which should be the benchmark.  if you can't make an amazing apple pie, you should go into the cupcake business.  The apples were wafer thin and under-cooked, the spice was too strong, too much allspice or clove, over-powering.  Seasoning should be subtle and delicate with nice chunks of soft baked apples simmering a a delicious almost caramelized sauce....something to really blend in with Ice Cream if you go a la mode.    The most telling sign has to be this.  My two kids ate two bites and left theirs untouched on the counter and a day later I have half the pie left.  Even the crappiest $5 pie from Fry's I pick at until it's long gone within 2-4 hours tops.  Today I brought the leftover to office, those vultures will eat packets of taco bell hot sauce.     Maybe my palate is not sophisticated enough to appreciate a $20 artisan pie.  My palate doesn't give two shits about anything but taste and texture, period.

The ruelo cake was layered with chocolate mousse, vanilla crème brûlée, crispy praline, and chocolate sponge cake. The chestnut rum cake has chestnut mousse, rum mousse, chestnut pieces, flourless chocolate cake, and pate sucre.   Their cakes have great presentation so if you want to impress your loved ones, their cakes are good to get some ooos and ahhhs.   It's one of the bakeries that I can rely on when I need a decent looking cake that is interesting. The only downside is that the cakes may not be made fresh to order when you order it. A lot of their mousse cakes are already made in advance and are defrosted in time to give their clients. But if you haven't tried their cakes, feel free to take a look at their website and see what you like. I like that they also posted what kind of cakes they offer and break down the cake layers for you to see what is exactly inside each cake.   Last tip?

Today was not like the other times, I waited 20 minutes when I decided to go inside to see what was going on. When I got in the lady behind the counter that seemed to be the manager asked if she could help, I explained what had happened which seemed to upset her. She went over to the register and said there were no online orders and began to help other customers, no explanation or assistance. When I pressed her about what can be done she called over another employee and she and the other employee looked at the register again and told me that there was no order. I then pressed her and showed her my email confirmation and that my card had already been charged which did not seem to change the poor attitude of any employee.  After about 5 minutes of no help I said that my card had been charged and that I would need the order I had paid for, the manager just walked away and another employee stated that she tried ordering via the app and that it showed her card got charged but it didn't show up on the register and there must be an issue with the app and she wasn't really charged. I again showed them my email receipt and the chase app showing that my card indeed was charged. They eventually stated that I would have to contact my credit card company, to which I said that I wanted my order. They grudgingly gave me my order and I left. Even proving through multiple sources that I had indeed placed an order and paid for the lunch I barely got my food. After this experience I will not be going back, the customer service is horrendous.

I don't need to sing the praises of these bagels. They are the best. SO YUMMY. The perfect amount of sweetness, density and chewiness.   The café concept means bagel sammies, salads and coffee. The idea of picking up a dozen bagels and then sitting with a freshly made bagel is pretty awesome. My sesame bagel was perfect and piping hot with first bite.

When the soup was brought to us, the cup of soup was half full. We asked for more soup. We, after all, were paying $1 extra to have the matzo ball on the side.  We were told it was a measured amount....that's how they do it. Except it's not and we know because like I said, we've been regulars for YEARS. We asked for the manager who, instead of offering more soup, tried to justify the half cup of broth. So, it would seem that a few cents of broth was worth losing regular customers who have been loyal for almost 2 decades. All we wanted was a cup of soup!

Le personnel est des plus sympathiques, l'atmosphère chaleureuse (j'adore le mur de briques exposées côté cuisine) avec des oeuvres d'art au mur qui sont à vendre (plus chères que la bouffe, par contre...lol). J'ai mangé un des meilleurs croque-monsieurs en Amérique du Nord, fait dans les règles de l'art avec une rafraîchissante petite salade. Un peu de moutarde de Dijon était offerte dans l'assiette, moutarde qui une fois étalée sur le mets, s'harmonisait parfaitement avec le délicieux fromage fondu, les tomates bien fraîches et le délicieux jambon qui font de ce croque-monsieur un régal. J'aurais bien aimé un croque-madame (ajout d'un oeuf) mais j'étais néanmoins plus que content. Côté boisson, le caffe latte était lui aussi irréprochable. Onctueux et velouté, tel qu'il se doit et sans grande amertume. Et leurs desserts maisons sont aussi très bons: le biscuit avoine et raisin est parfait, sans que nos papilles gustatives soient prises en otage par le sucre comme dans les biscuits que nous vend une certaine sirène dont je tairai le nom.

Honestly, everything tasted like it was frozen and heated in the microwave ( it also arrived really quickly...).

Apparently, I was really motivated this morning at McDonald's.  No one over the age of eight goes to McDonald's for the food.  We either go because it's quick (sometimes) or cheap (not anymore) or convenient or because we are craving that childhood food memory.  So Jim and I met there this morning  (score one for convenient) for a quick snack and chat about the week.  While we're waiting for the food I notice a sign that says they have free samples on Monday morning.  I was fascinated by this.  Since when has McDonald's offered samples?  And who hasn't tried their potatoes and needs to know what they taste like?  Who doesn't know the taste of crunchy grease without a reminder?  So, curiosity getting the better of me, I asked for a sample.  I really wanted to see what it was.  That's when I was reminded where, exactly, I was.  I was told that there was no way I could have a sample.  When I inquired why that was I was informed that the person accompanying me had ordered what they were sampling.  Oh.  Though most yelpers know my prolific yelper husband, this woman did not.  In fact, she had no idea who he was in relation to me.  He could have been my husband but he could just as easily been an anal colleague who would rather die than allow me to sample his food, which I assume was the implication in her refusal.  Now, I acknowledge that this is a ridiculous nothing of an issue.  But these days I run into more and more silly little annoyances and I just couldn't let this one pass.  You see, the woman was very satisfied with herself, as if I was trying to 'get over on the man' (i.e. McDonald's) and she thwarted me.  It's just so stupid.

{"bus_id":"fyJAqmweGm8VXnpU4CWGNw", "text":"I have been wanting to go here since I first got wind of this place and FINALLY made it today!   I am not familiar with Creole style food and one of the owners (I think) was happy to give me the low down. She even offered to make me a new coffee if I didn't like the chicory flavor, since it was my first time having. Awesome customer service! I also can't have dairy so I asked what their non-dairy options are. They just had soy. So of you've been reading my reviews, you know I get peeved when a local coffee shop doesn't have almond milk. So I decided to suggest they offer it, and the owner said he would from now on! So those of you almond milk lovers can thank yours truly for French Grocery carrying almond milk :)  Anyway, we ordered macaroons (I liked the green one the best, I think it was pistachio rosemary). They were perfect! Soft, chewy, not too sweet, bold flavor. The beignets were hot and fresh covered in powdered sugar, OMG to die for. And the praline bacon. Just sinful. I wish they would serve those hot out of the pan though. The one we got had been sitting out for a few minutes and cooled down and got kind of limp. They were so delicious. I'm a huge fan of sweet and salty mixed.  Unfortunately, they were sold out of croissants by 10am! I'm coming back during the week for those. Diet be damned.  We also got a French press and cafe au lait with chicory. I really really liked the chicory flavor! It's hard to explain. They use Cortez Coffee which I was thrilled to hear about because we know Ron Cortez and his coffee is superb.  Since they are brand new I figure there are kinks to be worked out. It was kinda hectic and disorganized at the counter. I think they are still finding their groove. I think they need to open earlier and definitely need to be open on Sundays. Parking is also a pain. But, their food and coffee is high quality and delicious. They will have lines out the door by the year's end.  Can't wait to come back. Seriously, I can't get that green macaroon and cafe au lait with chicory out of my mind. And the beignets...and French press...and praline bacon..."}

That's a big deal for her to abandon Cinnabon!  So - Urban Beans is a cute little coffee shop. Ample seating inside, cute art on the walls that's for sale, and a really nice little patio outside.   I had a soy white mocha and a java chip scone, and it was only $7.50  That would run $10 at the big green mermaid!  Both were really really good.   They aren't doing made-to-order food anymore, which is what I think most bad reviews are about. The pastries are all freshly baked though.

I love the festive bistro-like vibe and can understand its popularity yet personally have found the food and service to be just average over the years. In spite of that, I still seem to enjoy it a little more each time I go. Before today's breakfast  visit, it had been almost entire year since my last.  My wife and I ordered the Italian and Mediterranean crepes, which ran $8 each and included golden fried potato cubes as a side. The serving sizes were generous and the crepes were masterfully crafted - very thin with the perfect amount of golden browning - and beautifully plated.  The filling of the Italian was a bit dry; however, the Mediterranean filling consisting of diced chicken breast, spinach, onions tomatoes, feta cheese and black olives was quite good. In fact, I would order it again. We also enjoyed a couple of specialty lattes that were tasty, artistically created and very reasonably priced at around $3 each.  In the past, I have also tried the the 18 Wheeler, a simple breakfast combo comprised of Challa bread, two eggs over medium, two bacon slices and potatoes. At $9.25, it was a little pricey for breakfast, however, most everything was nicely prepared especially the skillet golden browned potatos. The Challa bread, which is just a fancy name for thick French toast, was just average at best however (as was the coffee.)  Service was very good and sanitation grade was an impressive 98 and is consistently in the high 90s. Of course the dining area was packed as usual. Again, although I don't love it, I do seem to like it a little more with each passing visit; that and readily available BOGO free coupons pretty much guarantee another meal there soon. With this review, I am also upgrading them from 3 stars to 4 for the first time; however in actuality, if Yelp allowed such precision, the new rating would be 3.75 up from 3.25."}

'Caribou' provides great coffe and tea in a pleasant atmosphere.  This particular 'Caribou' is the most roomy and pleasant in the entire Cleveland area.  (Believe me; I've spent too many long hours in each of the Cleveland-area 'Caribou Coffees.')  The staff of this Lakewood store is wonderful, pleasant and easy-going; as are most of the regular customers.    THE DOWN-SIDE: The music is consistently too loud.  In addition, the location is plagued by non-stop (I'm talking for several years now) problems with the heat and AC.  It's always way too cold or way too hot.  They do offer 'free' wi-fi if you're only staying an hour.  After that, you must purchase a $1.50 drink minimum per hour for additional time; forcing you to enter in code after code if you stay a few hours.  (It's a real pain in the butt when you've got computer type work on your mind.  You find yourself watching the clock to avoid having your Internet connection killed.)  THE SUM-IT-UP: If you need a nice place to hang for hours while you suckle from the corporate teat, this location is for you.  However, I much prefer 'Lucky's Coffee Shop' in Tremont.  It is far more pleasant, the food is unbelieveable and baked on-site, and the wireless is free!"}

My sister had the 1/2 sandwich and soup, which was the Doc's Choice sandwich on sourdough. I should say that I teased her about the half sandwich thing. I find ordering half sandwiches rediculous when you can have a whole sandwich instead, but whatevs. Her sandwhich was decebt. Nothing special, though. I forgot what the soup she ordered was, but it tasted like chicken and rice but with lots of lemon. I actually really liked her soup. It was good and hot. On the day we went, it was raining, so it was perfect.   I, however, did not like my food. I ordered the Smokey Joe sandwich and a bowl of Broccoli Cheddar Soup. My soup was barely warm. I love soups, and it's hard to mess it up when its not made from scratch unless you burn it or serve it cold. The sandiwich had way too much Mustard. WAY too much. I couldn't really taste anything other than the mustard. It (I kid you not) dripped mustard. But, this being the first meal of my say at 4 p.m., I ate HALF of my sabdwich exept the crust because it was only mustard and bread. And I finished my cold soup. My sister did point out my hypocrisy about my whole Half-sandwich rant. It was somewhat embarrassing.   Now, I'd like y'all to know that I'm known to practically lick my plate clean. I eat a lot. Anything. And just about everything. If I can't finish my food for whatever reason, I get it to go because I will finish it as soon as I get home .

That, however, is not what I received. What I received was a cheese sandwich that had been put through an oven on a conveyer, Albeit the cheese was melted the bread was as white and untoasted as when they sliced it off the loaf. I inquired of the young lady at the counter as to why this was the case, (A grilled cheese should come out with a golden brown, crispy, crunchy and delicious exterior crust. Which is created by the application of butter to the exterior of the bread before you GRILL it.)  I was told that they put there garlic butter on the inside of the sandwich so as not to mess up the grill...what grill? there is only the oven with a conveyor belt. This is inadequate, to say the least. That's fine if you want to do it that way but don't call it a grilled cheese sandwich, it is not!!! Perhaps your employer would think about purchasing a Panini grill or something that would produce the desired exterior.   To the young woman who helped me, don't ask me have a had the sandwich here before because clearly I have not! I have a completely different idea of what a grilled cheese sandwich is, as I'm sure most people would. It was not the warm cheese sandwich that I got.  I have not any other sandwiches here.

But in all seriousness I am not an ice cream fan.  If we were putting our love of ice cream into the decibels in which we scream mine would be a quiet, halfhearted, 'okie dokie'.   Put A Cone On It, however, made me scream with delight.  I popped in here with my super cool Canadian cousin who lives a couple bus stops away from this establishment.  She had never been and we were both jonesing for a sweet.  Ice cream in 50 degree weather was not my first choice, I digress.    What we ordered: we split a three scoop cup and got earl grey, pumpkin pie, and matcha green tea.  WOW. The flavors of the the ice cream were so true to their real life counter parts it was alarming.  The earl grey especially was delightful. It was like having the creamiest cup of tea.  The matcha was not over-sweetened, it still had that bitter twinge of tea taste to it.  Finally the pumpkin pie: what can I say about this perfected flavor? The spices were there, the texture was phenomenal, and I was a happy camper.    This place definitely deserves five stars.  The ice cream was not icy or hard, just fresh and soft like you always want ice cream to be. Makes me sad this place doesn't exist in sunny California."}

Although I've never been to the East coast I feel this place would fit right in!  I love all the freshly baked breads and desserts that they have.  I also love that you can order deli style or sit in the restaurant.  Now me and the bestie had decided to have brunch before starting our day.  When we arrived at the café at first I was like hmmmmm this looks like a business complex, which it was.  I was a bit envious of these people because they got to eat here everyday.  So we entered the café and were sat at a table quite quickly.  Surprisingly as busy as they were our drink order was taken very quickly.  We checked over the menu and anytime I come to a new place it's always hard for me to choose or go with favorites or with what the regulars get.  Because well you just never know. So anytime I want to gage a new place I always get something that is easy and simple.  I only do this because I want to see how a place makes the easiest thing on their menu.  So I got the typical everyday breakfast of bacon and eggs along with a bagel and cream cheese.  Let me tell you the food is amazing and the bagels are huge!  The bacon was just how I like it, nice and crispy and the eggs were wonderful.  Not runny or undercooked.  I really enjoyed my breakfast and without a doubt one of the best I've had. Now onto the bakery!!!  Now I'm always a sucker for a good and delicious baked good and this café does not disappoint.  There are tons of items to choose from.  Now had I not had to travel on a plane I would have bought a few loaves of bread both regular and sweet and some cinnamon rolls, but unfortunately I don't trust my food to anyone else so maybe next time.  So I settled for a couple of Black & White cookies, which are my second favorite to chocolate chip.  Let me tell you those cookies didn't last till my trip home because I just couldn't.   All in all I'd say I would definitely make the trip back here the next time I'm in Vegas."}

I wanted to get a good sample of the place, so we ordered bagel with butter, bacon egg & cheese, and a Reuben. Only thing I'd eat again was the bagel. The main cooking appliance for cooking in this joint in the microwave, eggs included. Nasty!! There is no flat top to be seen! I've never been to any NY deli serving hot food without a grill or flat top.   Another reason I will hesitate to come back is the staff. Very loud, rude, pretty much the customers were an interference with whatever they were talking about. I'm all for camaraderie, but this was just obnoxious.

Us Americans (particularly New Yorkers) would like to think that we've got the best bagels on the planet, but this Montreal bagel shop proves that perhaps we aren't the Global Dominating Power of All Things Bagel.   These aren't the bagels you'd expect coming out of an NYC deli. Not inferior, just different. Flatter, smaller, and more crusty, these are an equally 'authentic' version of bagel that also originated from Eastern Europe, but  found home in Montreal instead of NYC.   Extrodinary bagels. And dare I say it? As a bagel-fiend I actually prefer the St. Viateur bagel to the bloated doughier American version. What this says about my proclivities, I'm not sure.

{"bus_id":"YHE1PS0mhFbwKJm8iJpcuQ", "text":"The Communal Mule completes a triad of very-close-together coffeeshops along Dundas West, viz., Ezra's Pound and the Tampered Press. It's a tiny spot on the North side of the street that's kind of hard to find; on my visit the windows were fogged over but the signage promised art, community, music, inspiration and of course, espresso within.  You'd have to remark that it's pretty beautiful inside. Concrete floors, marble topped tables, long benches made of logs, walls dappled with found signage and other bric-a-brac. Cool this place definitely is. As you would expect there is a communal table inside, but it was a little lacklustre for something called out in the shop's name. I think it seats about eight, and I wouldn't put it in my top five communal tables in Toronto.  But no matter. In addition to espresso they serve loose leaf teas and nibbles by Circles and Squares. I espied some interesting looking blueberry scones and dulce de leche cookies, but alas, I was only in the market for an espresso that day. I ordered a cortado ($3.25, I believe) and I was surprised that it was made with such a cavalier attitude. Just a shot drowned carelessly in milk, and slid across the counter to me. I don't expect preening and latte art, but the effort was underwhelming fo' sho'.  Still, the CM seems like an excellent (and tirelessly hip) place to show up with a laptop and get some work done. There is free wifi, but outlets are little a harder to come by here. I'd give it another shot.  Obligatory Title Pun: I wonder if this is DON QUIxote's favourite café.  Menu Readability: I spotted no less than five chalkboards.  Need to mention: They play wretched 90s house music here. You'll want to kill yourself, if this isn't your thing.

I think we all tried about 3 or 4 flavors each before deciding on what to get. We decided to go for three scoops in a cup: hojicha (roasted green tea), earl grey and black sesame, which was then topped with a piece of a waffle cone on top so it looks like an upside down ice cream cone.   The black sesame almost tasted like peanut butter, very rich compared to the earl grey and hojicha which were a lot lighter.

They may not serve what I consider to be 'connoisseur level' coffee but the basic fundamentals are there (no V60 pour overs or milligram-perfect dosing rituals though, lol). The beans are roasted on site in small batches and are fresh. Don't get me wrong, the coffee is very good but if your standard is a Klatch or Intelligentsia then you may not leave completely impressed. It still falls well within my range of acceptability  They've been here forever and are very active in supporting the local Sunnyslope arts scene and community. Not hipster - upscale, this isn't Cartel or Lux, just a nice local coffee joint where you will find a mix of old timers meeting for their daily coffee and high schoolers from across the street hanging out after school.

They're usually very aesthetic and always nice to give as a gift, birthday or for any other special occasion. This place is on the more expensive end across all their products.

I was going to get a water along with the espresso and the cashier informed me that I would be charged for the water. Really? What kind of service is that. My dad was even going to decline on the espresso, but since my mom was having a hard time staying up we got the coffee. Really, 50 cents for water?"}

While I waited, I was taken by all of the fabulous looking pastries and cookies in the display as well as the great, open interior. I was extreemly impressed with what was said to the owner's art along the walls. Anyways, back to the coffee drink... IT WAS ABSOLUTELY TO-DIE-FOR! After I got my drink my friend and I took advantage of the great patio and the cool (finally!) night. The only thing I could poke at, was that it took longer than I thought it would to get my drink, but I do realize that they are brand-new. What a great new spot! Oh, and P.S. -- I was surprised to learn that their cups made from corn biodegrate within 45 days! Now that's impressive!"}

I found this restaurant searching yelp and decided to give it a try do to it's overwhelming rave reviews. It's a bit too small of a place for my taste accommodation wise. I like a little room while I am eating. The lighting is very dim and not very good for a restaurant. Kind of feels like you're in a dark cave. It was a Saturday morning so you can expect a wait time, which ours was about 30 minutes before our food arrived. Unfortunately, mine came with it really long piece of hair all curled up on the very top of it. The server took it back and brought me a new meal in a couple minutes just as the rest of our order was ready. Besides all the lack of attraction to this place & my mystery topping I quite enjoyed my meal. We had ordered 2 breakfast burritos, 2 egg and cheese crêpes and some nutella crêpes with bananas. The breakfast burritos and the chocolate banana crêpes were quite impressive. The egg and cheese crêpes were a bit greasy and also had a bit of spice to them. Being that we had typical kids with us, it's hard to find something on the menu that would satisfy picky plain children so if you have these you might want to consider feeding them before or go for the gusto and give them a sugar rush of chocolate. All in all, I really did enjoy the food. I think this place is best if kept for people with a flair for food but probably not children. I will return and flavor this place again but with out the kids"}

This is a small coffee shop with a few tables outside as well as wicker furniture. The inside is pretty much filled with tables, not much space to move around if there were lots of people on the inside. They have a drive-thru which most people seem to use instead of coming inside. Since it was a hot morning, I decided to have my coffee in-house and enjoy the AC.  Even though this place is small, it was nicely decorated and everything seemed clean. They have a bookshelf full of games for those that want to spend some good time here with friends and have some fun.   This place has a large menu with lots to choose from. I had a hard time deciding on what I wanted to have. Their hot drinks come in 12 oz/$4, 16 oz/$5, 20 oz/$5.75 and their Over ice & Blended drinks, as well as their Smoothies and Ice Teas, come in 16 oz, 24 oz, and 32 oz. Their prices on those depend on what kind of drink you get. I found that overall their prices are a bit higher than other coffee shops that I've been to here in the area.   I got the 24 oz Carmel Toe coffee drink which cost $6.25. It was pretty tasty, but a bit too sweet for my liking. It had a lot of caramel flavoring in it that overpowered the coffee taste. Definitely not worth what I paid for it.  The lady that took my order was very patient and knowledgeable of the menu. Since the menu doesn't say what is in each of their drinks she was kind enough to explain what was in the drinks I was interested in getting. My guest got the Peanut Butter blended coffee which was really tasty. They use actual peanut butter and not some flavoring for it and you can tell the difference. A must try for those that love peanut butter.   Would I come back again? Definitely!!"}

I was not disappointed. The interior is bright and quaint and everything seemed clean. It looks small from the outside, however it is more spacious than you think inside. Based on reviews from other Yelper's I had the sampler. Two eggs over easy, three pancakes, hash browns, and linked sausage. The meal was quite good. The pancakes fluffy AND golden brown. The eggs just runny enough, YES and the hash browns crispy and delicious. The only downfall (if you can call it that) is that they didn't give you/me enough hash browns.    Now here is where this story tanks. My server was a young lady with glasses and she was very INattentive. I need a refill on my drink and I had to walk up to the cash register to ask for a refill. She (my waitress) was so busy talking to customers about her recent cruise that she forgot I was there. I saw her at my table two times when she took my order and when she brought my meal. I quests I made the mistake of coming in around 11:30 and my order took a little longer than I expected (do in large part to the amount of take out orders that the kitchen was preparing), I was in there and seated by 11:15 and did not receive my meal until 11:51 WOWSER!!! While I waited I had the pleasure of watching the north side go by.   If you have a chance to stop in, get a window seat (number 9 or 4), relax, and enjoy a good hot meal. Make sure you have the time to wait. I hear they have a breakfast buffet on Saturday and Sunday. I may go back this weekend (or next) and see if today was a fluke or business as usual."}

One time, there was a couple of animators who can turn you into a hero or heroine of your choice.  If I ever see that again, I'd have them do my little cutie pie.

There were 3 staff members, and another on their lunch break. It was clear the guy making drinks was training.  After taking my order ( frapp with bacon breakfast sandwich) team member A at the register proceeded to stand there & chat with team member B while the guy training was left to make drinks alone.  I get my sandwich, 2 new customers come in. A takes the order & goes back to chatting with B.  New guy makes all hot beverage orders, ignoring the fact I was there before 2 others, then asks B  how to make my frapp.    Finally get my order after 11 minutes & as I'm leaving see the team member who was on break jump on the register & tell A (who is still just shooting the shit with B) to help with drinks.  I get outside, take a better look at my drink & can tell the consistency & color are all wrong.  Take a sip, disgusting, but no time to go back.

Bellagio, Caesars Palace, The Venetian, Paris, Grand MGM) und neue Hotels, die keinem Thema frönen sondern einzig aus sich heraus wirken. Das sind die top-modernen, in denen an nichts gespart wurde und die dadurch in anderer Weise ebenso imposant sind wie die Traditionshotels. Zu diesen Neuen gehört das Aria, das sich im neuen City Center am südlichen Ende des Strips befindet. Modernste Architektur, viel Glas bestimmen das Aria. Draußen im Vorfahrbereich beeindruckt eine geschwungene Wand, von der in unterschiedlichen Intervallen und Stärken Wasser hinunter strömt. Die lange Rezeption schirmt sich angenehm vom Casino-Bereich ab, bei meinem kürzlichen Besuch war der gesamte Deckenbereich des Empfangs mit großen Weihnachtskugeln dekoriert. Die Zimmer vom Feinsten. Wir logierten im 39. Stock mit atemberaubenden Blick auf Las Vegas. Großzügig gestaltet, viel Platz, im Bad allerdings wird an der Großzügigkeit ein klein wenig gespart. Aber das ist leise Kritik auf höchstem Niveau. Die Betten ein Traum, im wahrsten Sinne des Wortes. Ich kenne kein Hotel, das vergleichbar gute, exzellente Matratzen hat wie das Aria und die Kopfkissen  häufig ein Schwachpunkt in der Hotellerie  stehen dem in nichts nach. Die sind so gut, dass das Aria diese Matratzenart und die Kissen zum Verkauf anbietet. Für uns natürlich schwer nach Deutschland zu transportieren und nicht gerade billig. Ein paar Tausend Dollar (je nach Größe) sind pro Matratze hinzublättern! Ansonsten fehlt in den Zimmern nichts, absolut nichts, was den Aufenthalt äußerst komfortabel macht. Ich erspare mir das Aufzählen, es ist alles vorhanden!! Ansonsten bietet das Aria alles was das Besucher-Herz erfreut: Ein große, weite Casino-Anlage, diverse Restaurants, Bars, Shops. Im Außenbereich eine weitläufige Pool-Anlage, die bei unserem Besuch Ende November zum Großteil geschlossen war  off season. Ein Becken war immerhin geöffnet, der Bademeister langeweilte sich, das Wasser war angenehm warm, aber die aus den Zimmer mitgebrachten hochwertigen Bademäntel erwiesen sich als sehr nützlich beim Verlassen des Pools. Drei Whirlpools waren ebenso geöffnet, eine Erholung bei heißem, sprudelndem Wasser. Und wer mit der weiten Welt kommunizieren möchte: Im gesamten Hotelkomplex ist WLan frei. Allerdings muss man sich ständig wieder einloggen, denn nach kurzer Zeit der Inaktivität ist man raus aus dem Zugang. Fazit: Ein Hotel der höchsten Kategorie. Man muss suchen, um etwas zum Bemängeln zu finden und wird kaum fündig werden. Das hat seinen Preis, aber es gibt immer wieder Angebote! Die Lage ist prima zentral. Wohlfühlfaktor garantiert. Fünf Sterne  locker! Tipp: Valet-Parking ist kostenfrei."}

This place has become my home away from home for productivity. They have large, inviting study tables, a variety of music that I enjoy (ranging from soul and jazz to hip-hop), and a very polite crowd with people that take their cellphone conversations outside so you don't get distracted by some guy talking to his mom for an hour.  Their ham croissant sandwich is quite good, as are their side salads.

It can literally be shared between 2 or 3 people. The food/dessert selection is really big and the service was awesome too; really friendly servers. Decor was simply yet modern, if I do remember correctly this is a relatively new restaurant.  The only thing I was iffy about was the tapioca which didn't taste very good.

Of course, if you don't work uptown, this is probably not the most convenient location as you'd need to pay a pretty penny for parking in the area.   Located in Founder's Hall means there are quite a few tables to grab around the shop, as well as seating inside next to the fire if you need to warm up. And the staff at this location is always super friendly and energetic. Beware of the upsell, though....it was pointed out to me that a large coffee is only $0.10 more than a medium, so I went for it, but it ended up being WAY too much caffeine. Will stick with the medium next time while thanking the barista for her helpful suggestion. The lines always look really long, but the service is quite quick, so don't stress about that.  A medium coffee is only $1 on Mondays and they've recently instituted 'happy hour' during the week from 3-5pm, which includes $3 coffee drinks and $1 cookies. Fantastic deals for an afternoon pick-me-up. There's also free Wi-Fi, and if you sit inside the shop, there are plugs for your laptop."}

In fact, I always attempt to justify their low quality coffee, bitterly awful lattes, and subpar lunch food as 'Well, maybe this is just a one time thing?'. It's not. It never has been. And today was the last straw.  I met a friend for coffee because really what other choice do I have? Starbucks - a corporate overpriced coffee shop? Caribou - running into the same problem? Crazy mocha - if only the one in Oakland was bigger? So we settled for Kiva Han, it has a creative, funky atmosphere and we could sit outside and enjoy the beautiful day.   I grabbed their medium roast coffee, not because I wanted to, but because this was their only choice. They usually never have more than one roast *surprise*.  To my dismay, the coffee tasted like dirt. This comes as know surprise though, their coffee is always wretched. I've tasted better coffee in a Holiday Inn hotel room. They obviously do not put any care into choosing their beans (if they even use freshly ground).  On to their food. I have never ever eaten anything good here. I had a curry wrap once that tasty more like a mouthful of cumin and turmeric, rather than a spicy blend of well paired Indian ingredients. One friend perfectly described the food at Kiva Han 'It's like a bunch of hipsters got together and picked ingredients that sounded exotic and cool, even though they taste terrible together!'"}

{"bus_id":"yVuMIm6sY2nCvYmPSTl_pg", "text":"I don't usually write reviews that are less than glowing, generally because I'd rather not ruin someone's business because a server was having an off-day or if food is sub-par. I can put up with sketch. I went to Ryerson. But I'm writing this anyway, in the hopes that Infuse reads this and either stops serving coffee or make it less shitty. Preface: I like Infuse's first location (I think it was started by two Rye grads, good on 'em for caffeinating students). That location and its tea is pretty great, they've got delicious cakes and wifi aplenty. This location lacks most of that. Maybe there's something about Gerrard Square that saps everything good about something. Like a succubus of quality.   The GS location is decorated nicely and is super clean. Barista was polite and attentive. I took a chance and ordered the Signature iced coffee, which they described as their take on Vietnamese coffee. For a medium, I paid $5 bucks. (They don't do iced drinks unless you order in medium or large.)  Heads up, I adore Vietnamese coffee. I order it whenever it's an option. I make my own at home. Vietnamese coffee is incredibly caffeinated and sweetened. It's also super cheap. A tall glass usually costs less than $3ish. So I was prepared for something pretty good to justify Infuse's price (a previous reviewer says they import their grind from Vietnam, so that got me amped.)  I got my drink. Took a sip. Felt betrayed af. It bore little resemblance, if any, to Vietnamese coffee. Worse, the aftertaste was weird. It was like someone took the soggy pot grinds at the bottom of a bong, and squeezed it over. A $1 ice coffee from McD's down the street would have been better and probably taste more like Vietnamese coffee, that's how not good this cup was. The only thing it got right was the caffeine level, which was perfect; stronger than most.  I left Infuse and took a hot minute to have a vigorous internal struggle on throwing out a $5 coffee. Ended up choosing to do so because I got the feeling finishing it might make me sick. I returned and asked the barista to empty it in the sink. They did so, without asking me why or offering me anything to replace the mostly full cup. Cool fam thanks.  Other notable differences from this location vs the Ryerson one:  -Decided to go here because I was nearby and wanted to do some online work. In spite of having one or two Wifi signals, the barista said their Wifi was not for customers. And no outlets. -No cheesecakes either, but a sign says they do. Maybe just not on Monday afternoons.  TL;DR Just buy tea, which is probably just as good as the original location's. Really hoping that one cup was an exception, but think twice before getting the Signature coffee. Know yourself, know your worth."}

But, friends, let me tell you a tale of a particularly harrowing ordeal.  When I say 'a sailor' I mean 'a middle class white guy' and when I say 'sirens and succubbi' I mean 'coffee places.' I feel that disclaimer is important.  So I was sailing along with me vessel and me crew, and the lads (just me) were starvin'. As ye tend to be after many a fortnight at sea (an afternoon of laying in bed). Just then, we began to hear a gentle song floatin' o'er the breeze. Now, a seasoned captain such as meself (I'm 26 and sort of went to college) recognized these lilting notes as that of a succubus immediately. But the lads (nope), they was taken. Positively taken. I had to risk a mutiny or follow the call, friends, and I had no choice a'tall.  We (I) sailed into the port o' Starbucks and I was immediately taken by the number of other sailors. Surely this must be one of the busier ports for this mighty succubus. The succubus chose a simple decor and 'er minions are always quite friendly even amidst the chaos of so many enchanted sailors (middle class white people). Seating be limited, though, so batten down ye hatches if ye lookin' to settle for a spell. The minions, forever enslaved to her call, peddle reasonable quality goods and do so with speed.  I request a bean drink over ice and the minion, with it's Cheshire Cat smile, produces. The lads (again, I am friendless) be lovin' this oasis but only I know I am being taken. None of this is as it appears, friends, and the mighty succubus surely awaits in the murky shadows a-ready to plunge us all to our doom. But that mix o' reasonable quality an' reasonable speed, me hearties, it's a falsehood this sailor (boring white guyyyyyy) could get mighty comfortable in. Mighty comfortable, indeed."}

I hesitate to go bc I don't know if I will be guaranteed a space at the bar. Totally fine but we are bar people. I recently called ahead and ordered a gluten free stacked turkey sandwich, drove thru and picked it up, so fast, so frickin delicious! I love that sandwich!!!! My boyfriend goes pretty often for happy hour he also loves it. His jam is the roast beef sliders. Yum. All in all my only wish were if it were bigger! One last thing, I had the most amazing cocktail here, of course I can't remember what it is called but it has house made rosemary syrup and gin and bubbles (amongst a few other ingredients) SO SO GOOD! Love this local hot spot!"}
{"bus_id":"oFHvr1cAktvU-bQgrl4aPw", "text":"Food: I am not vegan or vegetarian (or even remotely close).I am a skeptic of any Mexican inspired food that claims to be both delicious and animal free since my compatriots love to eat even the ugliest part of an animal. Call me converted! The potato taco was DELICIOSO. I had no idea that potatoes could taste that way. Witchcraft! every single pastry I have eaten here has been perfect. they could sell this stuff in high end grocery stores and they SHOULD because this is America and our bellies demand it. Specifically - the sea salt Mexican wedding cookies & the dulce de leche filled cupcakes with meringue are delectable. I haven't eaten anything else here, so once I have I will come back and update. I usually give five stars for repeat performances.   Ambience: This restaurant is in a beautifully restored house in a historic neighborhood, so there are little nooks and crannies to explore both in and out of doors here. The decor is relaxed, clean and tasteful. Dog friendly porch included. There are theme nights with DJs and sweet music, so I am looking forward to attending one of those.  Note: I think it is important to keep expectations in order, here. The bar is small but mighty as is the staff. Good things come to those who wait, so remember you're not at McDonald's. The selections are proportional to the size of the whole operation, which is a bit on the smaller side. I say do a few things and do it well, so I am a fan of a small restaurant. Any foodie worth their salt knows that a 14-page menu is a bad sign. Though the menu is small, it is varied. It can get a bit crampy at the bar when you are ordering during high traffic times, so you might want to claim your stake at a table and take a menu with you to decide, then pop up to the bar to order when you're ready.  Edit: I am coming back to update to five stars. You can tell these owners really care about their community - locally and nationally. They team up with local vendors and have events to raise money for causes. 5 STARS!"}
{"bus_id":"uKKNw68mZZaa1jcyszEbyA", "text":"The food is amazing. Service is awful. The line to order was very long and the process took longer than it should have. Seating is very limited. After we placed our order (which included two people) and waited 1 hour for it to come out, they realized they never brought out the second order. So we had to wait another 30 minutes for the second order to be out. The Heart coffee there is perhaps some of the best I've had. We even purchased a bag to take home. I'll give it another shot, they may just have been short staffed that day."}

Very girly store with cupcakes and cocktails, both done expertly.  Creamy frosting prettily piped onto moist, delicious cupcakes.  On fridays and saturdays you can swing by for either until 11pm.  It's right in the center of Champaign downtown, making it perfect for pre-bar, post-dinner, or both on those days."}
{"bus_id":"X8AGCsJHw-GuTqkzy2J3cg", "text":"I returned with two friends for lunch the other day and was yet again wowed with their menu. I got the tofu banh mi, one of my dining partners ordered the roast beef sandwich with lentil side salad, and the third person ordered chicken chorizo quinoa soup and a biscuit. The tofu banh mi was flavorful and had been marinated in a salty brine, was served with pickled veggies on a crusty baguette with some sort of bean tapenade. I would have liked more bold Vietnamese flavors, but the springtime-y pickled veggies were really nice. The roast beef was a major hit, as was the pineapple lentil salad. The chorizo chicken soup was described as bland, but not bad. I've only ever had amazing experiences with soups here, so I believe this must have been a fluke. The pastry course (which I strongly recommend that everyone indulge in at Bluebird) consisted of an almond torte, a lemon tarragon mini-cupcake, earl grey shortbread cookie, and a carrot bundt cake. Each was its own perfect little bite of dessert extravagance, and I found that I was amazed at the skill and restraint of the pastry chef. The carrot bundt cake had a bit of orange zest and salt in the icing, which perfectly complemented the rich earthiness of the moist carrot cake. A favorite amongst all of us was the earl grey shortbread cookie.  As usual, the place impressed and was a fantastic stop for lunch. Sandwiches and salads are nearly always fantastic, and the meal was great with a few reservations."}

{"bus_id":"mRKTDhmeAt3oLYSsW54LLQ", "text":"Face meltingly good coffee and espresso. I am not exaggerating at all when I say that this is the best coffee I have ever had. They have multiple grinds available every day and the barista can tell you the details of each without batting an eye or pausing to think. Words can't really express how good the drinks are here, but I'm about to try.  Espresso drinks are complex beasts. The espresso shot needs to be good, which means your grind must be good, which means your roast must be good, which means you actually have to care about your product and put a ton of effort into it. If you can pull a good shot, you still have to get the milk right. I know that seems like it should be the easy part, but it's a detail that you can't overlook. Most places, even dedicated independent coffee shops (not just Starbucks/Dunkin/Tim Hortons), get their milk too hot; when you overheat your milk it gets bitter and acidic and no longer serves as a foil to the bitterness/acidity of the espresso, but instead it amplifies all the bad flavors you don't want.    When I placed the mug between my hands and they were warmed but not scalded I knew I was in for a treat. My expectations were exceeded in ways I couldn't have imagined in my wildest caffeine fueled dreams. After I scraped my face off the table I finished my mocha (not too sweet, not too milky, jusssssst right).    On top of crafting amazing drinks, Tony the barista is super friendly. I felt welcomed the second I walked into the bar. On my first day in Montreal he gave me a sample of their freshly delivered baked goods (the onion tart was AWESOME). Then he recommended I try a few things and when I came back the next day he not only remembered my name but asked how my day had gone and had a few more suggestions. Nicest guy I met on my whole trip.   The interior space is limited but I'd say it's more 'intimate and cozy' than 'cramped.' They don't have wi-fi but there are a few plug sockets if you're desperate. After you finish your drink, try their water. There won't be a bitter taste in your mouth that you need to rinse out and your mouth won't be burned but you'll be doing yourself a disservice if you don't try their super delicious water before you leave. No, I'm not joking. The water pitcher is filled with lemon peel and fresh thyme sprigs which is the dopest water combination ever.  When I return to Montreal, this is my first stop."}
{"bus_id":"ZNk4hO2EOVoSKcCBSwH-yw", "text":"This place is awful. If quick and dirty brunch is your thing they definitely have the dirty part down pat--everything is filthy--but service is extremely slow.  FILTHY. Dust everywhere, dirty cups that were poorly washed and still have lip stains on them, and food that looked worse than you could make yourself at home while hungover weren't even the worst part of it. And don't look up unless you want to gaze at the dust bunnies living in the paper lanterns above your head. Not sure how they passed a health inspection looking like that.  The slow and rude service was the worst part. Our waitress was nice; the problem was with the manager or owner dude, who I will now refer to as 'Bruh' (pronounced something between 'bro' and 'bra'). It was taking a really long time to get my order. The waitress came by and put an order that looked like mine in front of me. Seconds later she came back and took it away. She had mistakenly brought it to the wrong table. She seemed new. No big deal. So the manager/owner, Bruh, was quite rude and started yelling at her across the restaurant as if to make her feel stupid that she didn't know where table 6 was. I thought that was unprofessional and felt bad and embarrassed for her. I don't support places that treat their employees disrespectfully, especially so openly in front of customers. Not cool.  Several minutes later when he was coming by I got his attention and told him that it's been over half an hour since I ordered my food--though in retrospect I'd say closer to 45 minutes--and that waitstaff keep coming by and telling me it's coming, that I haven't seen it yet, and that if he could refund me my money so I can go eat somewhere else. He said 'F*** yeah bruh!' and stormed to the cash register. He was so mad! It was a definite 'what the heck?' moment.   I went to follow him, somewhat confused as to what was going on and if I was imagining how mad he was right now. I heard him angrily say something like 'that GIRL over there,' as if to purposely be condescending and disrespectful. When I got to the register I tried to calmly explain that I was leaving because it was taking a really long time. He yelled 'I don't care!' He was really mad and rude, making a huge scene, as if he took it personally. His behaviour was so ridiculous that I asked 'Why are you so mad?' and he responded that I was mad and giving attitude so he was mad back. Great answer. The professionalism and maturity definitely shined there!   I was trying to calmly rationalize with him to calm him down, then he started raging, saying that his place is organic and that I could go to Egg Smart across the street and be served faster, which sounded like he was trying to act like his place was better than Egg Smart. And I'm pretty sure organic eggs cook just as fast as factory farmed eggs. I buy organic eggs, Bruh, and make them at home and they don't take that long to make. Organic food doesn't take longer to cook; I eat at local, natural and organic restaurants all the time, and Saving Gigi takes the (organic, dust-covered) cake for the worst place I've been to in a while.  His behaviour was completely unwarranted and irrational. He was blowing it out of proportion. He was so mad, extremely unprofessional, and seemed to take everything personally. He was rude to me and dropping F bombs every few seconds. I was really shocked. I've never seen anything like it. I think I was more confused than offended. I decided to stop trying to rationalize and calm him down because people like that are incapable of rational thought. He was a total jerk, extremely loud and obnoxiously overreacting. Very dramatic. This guy is ridiculous and needs to chill out.  This was one of my only 'hipster' impressions and it left a bad one for sure. We left, checked Yelp and ended up going somewhere else, which also seemed to be run by hipsters--if the definition of hipsters was mid-rise tapered jeans and plaid--but they were friendly, polite and clean, so I know that this dirtiness and rude attitude wasn't a hipster thing, this was just a Saving Gigi thing. I will never go back here or the sister restaurant Saving Grace.   If price is your reason for going here, it's not even that cheap. The value is not there. We went to Union on Ossington and paid $4 more for a much better dish--naturally raised, freshly ground beef burger--so if you're broke and that's why you're thinking of going here, I wouldn't even count that as a pro, bruh. It's low value. This place is expensive for what it is (which is crap, if I wasn't clear).  Cole's Notes version:  If waiting 45 minutes for eggs and pre-made sides, slow service with a rude unprofessional manager, dirty glasses with lip stains, hair stuck to water carafes, and an ambiance full of dust bunnies is your idea of weekend brunch, then definitely hit this place up! Maybe if you're lucky you'll get to be called 'bruh' and referred to condescendingly and experience some F bombs and watch him rage at his staff!"}

{"bus_id":"FvVSy2r7_zDEhZWqLgjXNQ", "text":"Add this long overdue review to the others that sing the praises of this efficiently-run local deli. When eating out can play it safe for breakfast and order a simple standby OR you can explore a bit of culture via a thoughtful menu with quality ingredients.  The thing I love about The Bagel Cafe (TBC) is that here you will get a great meal no matter your breakfast habits. I wish I could say that I choose a unique breakfast when I come to TBC, but I do not. I order eggs (scrambled or poached), bacon, bagel, and fruit whenever I come. When I'm ready to venture out of my comfort zone, I'll order the smoked fish or hand sliced nova platter. It sounds dull, but I am proud to say that of the MANY times I have eaten here I have never been disappointed. Sure there are some slight variations in the food preparation, but the quality of the ingredients and care in preparation at this place never changes.   A NOTE ABOUT THE BOOTHS: We seated ourselves and moved form one booth (too much sun) to another and discovered something unexpected. The tables at both booths were set farther back than we felt comfortable. Usually a booth table will be fairly close to your body, but I had to lean in during the meal to be closer to my plate. I am sure that people who need a it more space are more comfortable as a result of the change.   FOOD: My NY mom and I visited recently and the cultural gap between us couldn't have been more evident than in our plates. I got the usual (eggs, bacon, bagel, fruit, with cottage cheese) while she ordered the overstuffed pastrami with chopped liver. People like me, looking for a meal we can order in any restaurant in the valley, will want to keep coming back to this place. They care about what they put on your plate in this place and they cook the food right. You won't be disappointed in dry, overcooked eggs here. And yes, as many have said, the bagels are amazing. I prefer the veggie spread--there is no equal in this town. The bacon has changed over the years, and I wish it was less salty, but it is always thick cut and flavorful.  Mom's pastrami was outstanding.  If, like me, you are accustomed to thinly sliced, rubbery meat, you will have to rethink your relationship with this delicious smoked meat.   When the waitress didn't bring our large fruit cup with the meal,I figured she'd forgotten and I wasn't worried about reminding her. A few minutes later she set down a cocktail-type glass stacked with fresh fruit arranged in the shape of a flower arrangement with pineapple, kiwi, banana, strawberries, and pear. It was a smart way for TBC to remind it's customers that they care about small touches.    Everything is good here.  I can't wait to get back."}

I ordered the Peach Jasmine Cold Brew Tea. It tasted more like a flower Peach then Jasmine. It did taste clean and gave an after taste of Peach. It didn't taste over concentrated with sugar; however, I do think they add too much ice since the brewed tea is already cold as it was already refrigerated. Would recommend telling them to add a little bit less ice, so I can have more iced tea.  The reason for the 4/5 star review, is I haven't tried there coffee yet.

We were lucky it was a cloudy morning with some slight rain, as LNC only had one other couple ahead of us waiting for a table. We had about a 15 min wait which we didn't mind.  When we were seated, we fell in love with the interior. The beautiful bay window and Parisian design made us feel like we had stepped out of downtown Toronto and taken a seat at a cafe in Paris. It was an intimate and romantic venue.   We ordered the cafe mochas and were delighted at the delicious sweetness in a mug!   Being in a french cafe, we ordered the crepe classique for us both to eat on the side of our eggs benedict.   When the food came out, I was disappointed to see the hash browns on our plate looked like the plain frozen hash browns you can buy at the grocery store, although with the addition of peppers and onion. These were flavourless and dry. The eggs benedict were tasty but only had a tiny spoon of the creamy hollandaise sauce that you generally want to taste with every bite. These also were fairly bland and lacking flavour.   We had quite high expectations for the food and they did not hit the mark.  The crepe classique, however, was possibly the most delicious crepe I have ever eaten. It was a single crepe with icing sugar softly sprinkled on top. I wasn't sure if I needed syrup for this crepe but when I took my bite I realized there was a sugary texture biting into it. It was light and sweet and tasted like being in Montreal.   Unfortunately, the crepe costs $7 and at only one crepe, seems rather overpriced. If I ordered that alone, I'd leave with a happy tongue but an empty tummy.   Overall, the food was rather expensive and underwhelming. The crepe, mochas, and interior design were the best things about our experience. If we are to ever return it would likely only be for a crepe as a light snack.   -Ashley Marie"}

I myself have only tried a few of their juices.l but wish you could purchase a flight to try. Yes they do let you sample them, but I feel like it might be easier that way. When I asked the cashier if they had something like that, she just looked at me like I was crazy and said the best way to try more juices is to buy a whole set.. so pretty much spend 70$ for 7 juices. Which hey if they are great why not, but if I don't know what they taste like that doesn't make much sense. Coco crack though... pretty sure it's just that. I could drink about 20 gallons of that stuff. And seems to have the least amount of sugar than the rest of the juices. I did purchase one juice that was expiring the next day, and the company sent me an offer for a free one, so that was pretty amazing of them to do. Great company for sure. I'll be back regardless of pricing because they're addicting."}
{"bus_id":"cMAv53bpH7b32IYgQwCXLA", "text":"My favorite new drinks/snacks place! I actually never heard of this place before they came to Vegas. I'm glad that they did! I've been here a couple of time, and I was more satisfied each time of the food and services.   Since it's still brand new, I would suggest you go on a off hour or a weekday. Although I had to wait in line(inside of store, not wrapped around the building), the line moved quickly on Thursday night: The food came out faster than last time I was here even though the line was longer this time. It only took them 15-20 mins to make the food as opposed to 30/40 mins. It seems like they are working out the kinks well.  Yesterday, I was not happy that my popcorn chicken was all tiny crumbs with breading and skin unlike the first time when I had it. I took it back to the counter. The girl apologized and was able to get kitchen to replace it in a timely manner. I was happy that they did that because now I can keep going back without worrying about the customer services.   Some of the things I've tried so far.  Drinks:  1. mangonada(5/5): I always like chamango. I enjoy how they make it here. However, I would ask for extra tajin on your drink to make it more flavorful.   2 Spicy watermelon (5/5): this will probably be my go to drink now in the summer. So refreshing! Ask for extra tajin on this drink too!   3. Ube milkshake (4/5): IG worthy drink. It is so cute with marshmallows and candies. If you like taro and sweet drinks, you should give it a try. The boba was perfectly cooked.   4. Thai tea (4/5): it's Thai tea, so not much to say about it. It tasted fine and it was just Thai tea. Can't really do it wrong.   5. Sea salt green tea (4/5): it was good but the boba was a bit overly cooked this time.   Food:  1. Hot Cheetos elotes (5/5): loved it! I crave for it so often now I don't know if I can have just regular elotes. It's so flavorful with hot cheeto and cheese. I would ask for extra lime though.   2 Popcorn Chicken (4/5): I got the salt and pepper twice. I really liked it the first time but the second time, like I mentioned earlier, it was all crumbs. Make sure you tell you if you only get the breading.   3. Hot Cheetos Cheese Fries(5/5): loved it as well. It's a genius idea to add hot Cheetos to anything . It was so yummy!   I have been recommending all my friends to come try it out. I'm gonna try more signature drinks and get my elote fix soon!"}

Similar pricing structure to the typical coffee co's with your choice of small, regular, or large.   We paid four eighty and change for a regular size, and it was definitely more than enough for two to share after lunch.   Will be back. May have to try the iced version. :9"}

There is one guy who is actually really good w/ customer service, seems maybe late 20's and is very friendly and has 'get up and go' but the rest of them will literally watch you stand around for 5 min before taking your order.  'We'll be right with you' ....but not really.  Since I like a lot of cream in my coffee the one dude will charge me for a grande coffee in a venti cup, but the others haven't caught onto this concept.... instead they charge you for a huge coffee when you're only getting a grande.    Today I was the ONLY customer besides someone at drive-thru and they didn't have my online order at all, and when I asked how long espresso would take one of the girls said 'about 5 min.'  Really?  5 min on espresso when I'm the only customer?  So obviously didn't have time to wait ....hence using the 'convenient' mobile app to order.  Ended up having to get a regular coffee.  Their cups ALWAYS leak on the sides so I had molten hot coffee dripping on my hand.  There was about 4 or 5 people working in there yet I had to stand around and wait on one of them to take my order.  This Starbucks is the worst.  I only go here b/c it's convenient.  Of course, this is a first-world problem but it makes for a crappy morning when you expect a mobile order to be ready and it's not.  I hate paying full price for sub-par quality and service.  Starbucks can do better."}

Eric came by and brought us waters and took the time to explain the menu. Steven and I have had pho before, but it was nice having someone suggest different types of noodles (rice noodle vs vermicelli noodles) for our pho. I ordered the P9 and Steven ordered the P11.   Our pho came out fairly fast I'd say and Eric brought us chopsticks and spoons. I really loved the spoons because they had a lip that would hang from the bowl so the spoon didn't fall into your pho. Dinner wise, I wished there was more meat. I've been to other places that have had a solid meat/noodle/pho ratio, but this place lacked that, at least last night. I'm willing to try this place again though and see if it was just an off night for the ratio."}

Inside we were immediately greeted by a friendly barista that gave us the ins and outs. I ordered the cauliflower tacos (they came highly recommended), my boyfriend got the chorizo tacos (made with tofu) and we split a side of fries. Everything was DELICIOUS!!! Bonus they have a fantastic game selection (Guess Who, Clue, Jersey Shore puzzle). It was a place I could easily spend all day. There was only one drawback- they have a great beer selection (if you like IPAs), but the beer wasn't super cold. I was probably the first to order one (it was 11:30AM), but I am a girl that likes an ice cold brew. Other than that it was a totally amazing experience!!"}

I was really happy to see that this place gave a shit about their customers, they didn't have the side I wanted so they actually called me and asked me if I would prefer a different side instead of just throwing something else in there without consulting me like so many other restaurants involved with Grub Hub have done to me in the past. Even if I had ordered something I didn't like I would try this place again because they actually care about you. On to what I got; The BBQ bacon burger was pretty good, the sauce seemed quite generic but I can live with that. The patty was cooked exactly how I ordered it, the lettuce and tomatoes were crunchy and tasted fresh. The bun was pretty squished and slightly burnt but I will chalk the morphed bun up to the nature of it being delivered. The fruit salad also surprised me, the fruit was all quite fresh and not like some mushy gross fruit salad cups you would get elsewhere.

I have continued to go there every week since they have opened, but I know that quite a few things have changed and it's really bothering me.   This review is strictly on the customer service that I am beginning to really dislike. Not one person looks like they are happy to work here, and they make me feel like I am completely inconveniencing them. I thought for sure from the very first day that this was going to be a great DD to go to. Everyone is so personable at the other two locations I visit, and I guess I thought this one would be the same.   If this sour attitude and unhappiness continues, I will take my business elsewhere."}

They make a delicious latte as well as hot chocolate and all the sweets are made in house. While I was waiting for my beverage, the allure of the wall menu drew me in and I ordered a bagel with peameal bacon and cheese. Tasty!

The Oreo milk tea is usually the milk tea I like to recommend my first time goer friends because they're already familiar with Oreo and it's not found everywhere in Toronto this kind of unique drink. Usually they're impressed with it!  Last tip?  Take advantage of the daily specials because you can get a size of a large of the drink of the day for the price of a small. Saves some money. For example, caramel pudding drink is on special on Wednesdays usually. Their chillers which are crushed ice drinks are usually really good too.

The Smokey Joe turkey sandwich was solid as well, boasting thick slices of crisp bacon. The high light was definitely the Tortilla Chicken soup.

Also not a huge fan of the way they sell their coffee- $2.50 for a giant cup + free refills.  I drink a small cup of coffee and would prefer to just pay for that.

Comfortable surroundings with wifi and local patrons sitting typing away or meeting with friends or colleagues.  The food and beverages are solid with a number of options.  What makes this place difficult to rate is the service - I keep getting the sense that I am a burden when ordering.  No smiles, sometimes even a sigh... and the orders are straight from the posted menu without substitution or special request.  I even brought a friend in with me and she was taken by the attitude as well.  I would like to keep returning as it is convenient and good, but I'm now fond of the whole 'not feeling welcome aspect'.

{"bus_id":"bRntmjztJ4dFDA_LYiEECw", "text":"Food Quality & Price: I found that for the price, the food was not very good.  Most of our group (included myself) would rate the food about a 2/5.  Likely would not order again unless we were starving.  Even for $4 it was totally not worth it.  The drinks were decent. 3.5/5. Hot chocolate was great, lattes only so-so.  Very average.  However, you're not here for the cuisine.  Facility: Main level is clean and spacious.  Definitely could fit more tables if they wanted to (but that's subject to staff availability).  Washroom are disgusting though.  Mirrors need a wipedown, toilets need to be fixed and everything generally needs to be maintained.  Really gross.  Service: Originally, our order was taken by Emily. She was friendly but she totally vanished and only showed up near the end of our 4 hour stay.  During that time, Fergus was our server (he was attentive and enthusiastic).  Food was delivered sporadically and one of our groupies' order never came. After being kind of lost as to what new games we wanted to try out, Jonathan came to the rescue with his knowledge of games and was very good at explaining the rules. Generally, we were very happy with the service around the games, but everything from booking to food was a flop.  Booking: I felt like this needed a section on it's own.  As other reviews have said.  An absolute nightmare.  I booked a month and a half in advance for a table of 8 and was told that I would receive confirmation within 24 hours of my booking.  I did not.  Instead, I sent several emails back, made phone calls and PERSONALLY dropped by the establishment to confirm my reservation.  FINALLY, almost three weeks later (after receiving 8 RSVPs), I was notified that my reservation was cancelled.  I called, dropped in AGAIN and sent back emails expressing my displeasure. Snakes and Lattes reluctantly agreed to accommodate my group of 8 (but only have suggesting that we cut down to a group of 4, no way). They repeatedly told me not to expect to be seated at the reserved time since they had planned a tournament that day.  Upon arrival, our table was ready 15 minutes prior to our reservation and there was plenty of room to open new tables. I echo other reviews in their comments that the booking/reservation system is garbage.  It needs to be completely revamped and someone needs to handle this with more respect and consideration.  Overall: A fun place to go with friends, just don't expect anything spectacular about the food or drink or service. I would probably come back if other friends have booked, but I don't think I will try to book again. It seems that the place prides itself on its 'hipster vibe'; shoddy booking system, way too laid back staff, mediocre quality food, and dirty washrooms. It really seems that most of how Snakes and Lattes works is 'too cool to care'.  So I supposed like more hipster things, it's overrated.  TIPS: Some good/short/fun games to play with a large group of 8 - try Say Anything and Anomia."}

The roast beef is also delicious. It doesn't have any of that gag-worthy pink sheen that you so often see on roast beef.  The egg-salad is perfect - I think the secret ingredient must be some sort of bottled love of grandmothers. The restaurant has got a handle on the details, and I love that.  Menus that look like newspapers. Homemade pickles. Special cream cheese.  Oh yes, the cookies. When you first walk in it feels like walking into Wilka Wonka's chocolate factory. The dessert case may even have angelic lights shining on it. Everything is made daily and is well-worth cheating on the diet.   Although the prices are a bit high (around $10 for a sandwich) you will definitely have leftovers for lunch the next day.

Yesterday at the recommendation of an employee I got the Doc's sandwich - I can't remember the exact name and it's not listed online, but she was so right.  It's mesquite smoked turkey, spicy aioli, peporoncini, onions, on this outstanding pretzel bread, toasted. Just the right amount of zing to it, though it had a bit more aioli than I would have cared for. It's slightly pricey at 8.95, though it comes with a (small) side of fruit. The first time there I got the Smokey Joe (mesquite smoked turkey breast, smoked gouda, lettuce, onion, tomato & cilantro with garlic aioli - w/o bacon for me) - also very good.  Next time I go I'll have to try the coffee, and they do have a surprisingly large selection of bottled beer.  I really like what the owners did with the old Willow House, which I used to go to back in the day. When I first went to Hob Nobs I was kind of sad to see the old place change, but they did such a great job with the renovation that it's hard to complain.   As others have noted, the parking is very tight; I've gotten lucky, but I'm pretty sure there's a sign that says you can park across the street.

Sadly I had breakfast earlier but I will be sure to come back for the main courses as they all looked tempting.  This is a simple, mostly self order kinda place. At the start of the line there are quite a  few baked goods I decided to pick a croissants (a good yardstick to judge a bakery) and a bichon (with a lemon filling) too bad I had already placed my ordered as I noticed some desserts from perennial favorite Rahier! (will come back for those) The croissants and bichon were quite good. Nice and buttery high marks here. The cappuccino didn't fare well though. here is the verdict Espresso: Medium Crema': average Milk: Frothed below Average Latte Art: None A half decent drink. I would say 2.5 stars. Hmm if you are in the mood to grab and go I would say pick up your capp from several decent alternates nearby and pick up your baked good here.

In addition to this, they like to try new and different things and they might have even exceeded my level of excitement when I recently asked them to make a London Fog. A while ago, in Canada, I tried this drink of steamed milk, Earl Grey and sweetener, and I was hooked. I'd forgotten about it until I saw an article about the drink's origins, at which point I decided to pick up a new hot beverage habit.  Not only were the people at LC willing to try out this little experiment, they took to researching the sitch so that they could perfect the tasty beverage without any poking or prodding from yours truly.

The foie gras seemed like a good option, and the chicken meatballs seemed like it would be tasty as well.  We ordered cocktails and they were inventive.  We had the lamb pasta dish and it was yummy and appropriately portioned.  So why the lower score?  Some logistical hiccups.  First off, we called to make a reservation and were told 845 was the earliest they could do.  Then we book on open table and get a reservation at 815... What?  Also, my goodness was the service slow.  We had planned on ordering appetizers, desert, multiple drinks but couldn't because we could never found our waiter.  The lack of attention really put a damper on the evening though and as enchanting was the atmosphere, the service was the opposite.  There is a chance for a real turn around on this place.

At least I can report that the service was fine with me, which apparently has not been the case for other reviewers.  They get credit for having literally dozens of options for drinks. That said, I can only review based on the one I had. I was intrigued at seeing a drink with oatmeal in it, especially since I'm a texture guy. The description was poor though, but it was explained that it was essentially a chocolate milkshake with blended oatmeal.  I did end up enjoying the oatmeal aspect of the shake, but I was surprised that it had a large scoop of vanilla ice cream on top that wasn't blended it. It was literally half the cup and the ice cream itself was fairly poor quality which really brought it down.  A bit of a mixed experience. I'd would try it again, but I'm not rushing back either."}

It's at the Gibson corner plaza one street north of Warden and Steeles, same plaza as Chatime and that hot pot place.  Sweet Esc seems to be known for their build-your-own waffle ice cream as their menu is limited in other dessert choices such as tarts and toasts.  For Christmas, their seasonal ice cream flavours include Eggnog with Rum and Mint Fudge ripple. We ended up getting their classic Coffee Milk Tea flavour topped with chocolate sauce on waffles with seasonal fruits (one free topping).  The waffles came on a hot sizzling plate where we had to pour out chocolate sauce on before it cools. That was pretty cool of a scene and action! I was surprised how well done the waffles were, being slightly crunchy on the sides yet super soft overall. The hot and cold mix of ice cream and waffle with sauce was delicious! The coffee milk tea ice cream was good too - wasn't too overwhelming and dense. I have to admit there was more coffee taste than milk tea though.  We also ordered a marshmallow toast afterwards. It tasted great.. though if you ask me, any melted marshmallow tastes fantastic! But I still think Sweet Esc made it yummy, especially the texture overall.  Service was good. They explained briefly the seasonal flavours along and asked whether we were first-timers. Flip side: not that it bothers me but one waitress dropped and broke a whole bunch of tea cups and pots during my visit.. Oh well haha.  The interiors is very simple and lightly decorated. It's pretty much a tiny dessert place, not much to really feel a relaxation besides the food."}

They also sell a wide variety of great breads, which seems to be the store's actual focus.   I learned of this place in a Chowhound board discussion last year. Now, no visit to Toronto is complete without a visit to this total find. Because of its intimate size, you wont find the selection of a 'chain' donut store, but quality trumps quantity, and unlike the chains, you can custom order anything you don't see. This week I ordered a Boston Cream with maple frosting instead of chocolate - YUM!  I love fruit filled, but not powdered sugar - no problem: order with sugar crusting, or plain!  Amazing.   On my 'favorite Toronto experiences list': buy a Boston cream and a coffee, drive south on port union road to waterfront, and eat at the park overlooking lake Ontario.   Everyday flavors are: (iced) chocolate, vanilla, and maple, with and without sprinkles. (filled) Boston cream, raspberry, lemon, blueberry, etc.   The filled are SLICED OPEN horizontally and a complete layer of filling is then applied, ensuring that each and every bite is rewarded (no searching for the gloop in one corner, which then squirts all over your chin/shirt/whatever).   The other distinguishing feature of the donuts is that they have an almost imperceptible 'crust' that is hard to describe, but transforms them from mere donut to something gourmet.   In donut-loving Toronto, this review is far overdue, and almost a public service for me to write. Long overdue kudos to P.U.B.  Phone number: 416-281-5614"}

Then it was on to the table groaning with all kinds of salads: fruit salads, grain salads, pasta salads, vegetable salads, etc. Wow, what a spread! I chose about five different kinds to try out and returned to my seat. Our main courses quickly joined our overloaded table. Upon taking a bite of my seitan sandwich, I immediately noticed how sweet it was. It had some spice to it, but the overwhelming flavor was sweetness. My friends took bites of their dishes and said the same thing. We then all tried our various salads. Good, but again, too sweet! What was going on here? Did whoever prepared the food have a serious sweet tooth? At least the cakes were good and sweet, as expected.  The food was okay but not nearly as good as I was hoping for.

The place is honestly pretty clean too so it's got that going for it.  The service was a complete trainwreck though.  Tables were full when we got there and I had to ask three times as to how long the wait was.  I'd ask and they'd walk away each time without responding.  Seriously?  Our group of four ordered and we got two drinks and one meal before anything else, even before any of the four sides/appetizers that were ordered.  Those came last, for whatever reason.  I actually never got the water I asked for twice.  How do you screw that up?  I actually asked and the waitress and she said they were really busy... which is fine... but it's water, come on.  Near the second half of our visit, we couldn't actually find any staff members either.  Didn't check up on us for a solid half hour and flagging them down took longer than it should've because they were talking among each other way too much.  The food and drinks are a tad overpriced, but if service was at a passable level, I wouldn't mind it nearly as much.

We have found that it's not really a great place to work or try to have a conversation as it's usually it's packed back to back with people.  But watching the hustle and bustle (and variety) of Kensington denizens this is the place to go.  The food is reasonable, and they put some twists on those coffees we all love - you know the ones that taste so good, but are so loaded with calories.  I've never had stellar food there, and only a few times have had speciality coffees that I really liked.  I would definitely say Higher Ground is a destination location rather than a culinary location.

{"bus_id":"2hSIeCX2cV-chFcBBXrZZA", "text":"I finally decided to give this place a second chance and once again I'm really DISAPPOINTED! I was in the area pet sitting and was craving a salad & juice then remembered this place was down the street so I said you know what why not splurge and see if they've improved since the last time I was in.  Both the associates were friendly but one of them complained when I ordered a 'Vegan Cesar Salad' which when I read the menu online just sounded delicious and I was willing to pay the big bucks for a freshly made salad with as I read their menu online states 'ROMAINE, AVOCADO, VEGAN PARMESAN, CASHEW CREAM, LEMON, BLACK PEPPER, SEA SALT, GARLIC, PUMPKIN SEEDS.' Sounds delicious right? Well apparently this associate had already 'made it for himself to have for lunch' and asked me if I was sure if I 'really wanted it' so I said 'yes, I want the vegan salad, it sounds delicious and then I want a great juice to go with it as I haven't been feeling well lately and I'm just trying to be more health conscious.'  That's when both associates were really nice and let me try maybe 5-8 different juices and mylks which for that I will give them credit for and I did leave them a tip for the time they spent helping me pick one out. Finally they sold me on the #4 but...when I got to my destination I open up the salad to find only romaine, avocado, cashew cream and vegan parmesan. Where was the lemon, pepper, sea salt, garlic and pumpkin seeds? And it made me think...if this salad was for you, why didn't you just make me a new one or say 'I'm sorry we are all out'. The fact that you gave me 'your salad' and it was missing items from the menu is just odd....very odd for a $10 salad.   I will absolutely come back for the delicious juice and mylks when I skip my Suja's but seriously, DO NOT bother coming here for 'food'. Please remember this is not a restaurant and don't make the mistake I have. Juice and Mylk only!!"}

Not sure if they were just having an off day or if this happens a lot, but we had a horrible experience here. We ordered our food at approx 11:20 and didn't get our food until 12.  I can understand that this place gets busy, but we saw people who walked in shortly after us with similar orders get there food at least 20 mins before us. After 30 mins of waiting, I went to ask if they had forgotten our food. They said it was about to come out, and we waited another 10 mins before the food came out. Eggs and crepe's were cold, burro was the only thing hot. Food overall was not as great as reviews that we had read, and the wait time just killed the experience completely. Will not be returning."}
{"bus_id":"yPcAdikNrXEsfbHNBQUjkQ", "text":"I visited the Zenith yesterday for Sunday brunch with fellow Yelper Chelsea S.  We'd been wanting to do brunch together for awhile, so I suggested the Zenith, since I knew it was near where she lives and I'd heard it was a really unique and cool brunch venue.  Although neither of us are vegetarian or had tried a vegetarian brunch before, we're both game to try new things, so we decided to check it out.  The first thing you notice when walking into the Zenith is the interesting kitschy antiques everywhere--including suspended from the ceiling.  Unlike the Beehive coffeeshop further down Carson St., which has similar interesting decor, it's my understanding that these items--as well as the tables, chairs, flatware, etc.--can be purchased.  I'm not sure of the range of prices, since I didn't inquire, though.  The second thing that became apparent, which I didn't realize from reading previous reviews, is that parties of two are mostly seated together with other pairs (i.e., communal/family style seating).  That wasn't a problem for us, since our tablemates were interesting conversation partners, but if you're a couple looking for an intimate/romantic brunch venue, you may wish to look elsewhere.  If, on the other hand, you're game for meeting new people, by all means, check it out!  As for ordering, the setup is a hybrid of a prix fixe and a brunch buffet.  All of the entrees, which change on a weekly basis, are the same price ($11.50), which also includes coffee or tea with unlimited refills.  (I had herbal tea.)  Once you order, you have access to the buffet tables, one of which focuses on salads and fruit/vegetable side dishes, and the other of which contains an assortment of bundt cakes.  For my entree, I ordered the pumpkin pancakes.  I was expecting wafer-thin flapjacks, but they turned out to be quite thick, moist, and cakey--in a good way. This entree was proof that vegetarian fare can be quite filling!  I wasn't as much of a fan of the side dish that came with it (not sure what exactly it was), but it added some welcome savoriness.  As it were, my selections from the vegetable buffet table added the savoriness I needed to offset the sweetness of the pancakes.  They included pasta salad, thai peanut noodles (?), chickpea salad, spinach salad, a piece of bread, and some fruit, as well.  All of them were quite good, and also filling in their own right.  Finally, I sampled several of the bundt cakes (double chocolate, vanilla blueberry, poppy seed lemon, and orange lavender (?)).  While I enjoyed all of them, too, my favorite was the double chocolate, due to its moistness. If you don't have as much of a sweet tooth as me, you may prefer some of the other flavors, which were less sweet.  I'm definitely glad that I tried the Zenith's brunch buffet, since it's one of the most unique brunches in PGH, for sure.  Even if you're leery of vegetarian food, I'd encourage you to check it out--I daresay you'll be pleasantly surprised!  And, of course, it was great to share the experience with a fellow Yelper (Chelsea S.), as well as our table mates, and make some new friends while enjoying a delicious brunch!"}

Sadly, we will not be visiting anymore since our favorite sandwiches are gone and not made to order as before.     We have been HUGE fans of Tammie Coe Cakes. It's been at least 3 years that we often get a treat here. Our must haves are the BLT sandwich, everything cookie, blackberry bran muffin (to die for!!) and some other sandwiches that I can't remember their names.   They sell all sort of yummy treats. We have enjoyed 90% of everything we have had the last few years.   I had a hot chocolate once that was horrible. So I can't comment on the drinks much but their hot chocolate was really terrible.   For thanksgiving we order a couple of pies the pecan and the apple one. For some reason when we tried them at the store (small size) they were good, but the big ones were not so good. :( They were good at the store but not the big ones we brought home. We won't try that again.   Tammie Coe is expensive, otherwise we would visit more often.   It's a great place to get a nice treat. They are super busy in the mornings.   The staff is very friendly but not very knowledgeable about allergies or ingredients.   The breads are very good too. I have tried a few loaves. However, they go bad or hard super fast.

I strolled in around 1pm, and it looked like either I missed the lunch rush or this just isn't the lunch spot for the CDN work crowd. Kinda hard for a little greasy spoon to compete with some of the places around here I imagine. But whatever.   The server was sweet, the pork chop dish I got was around 10 bucks, and it was solid. Nothing to call home about, but it did the job. Seasoned nicely and grilled, with some surprisingly good french fries and rice, and a salad. I could've done without the alphabet soup.

The prices ($3.50 - $5) were reasonable for the size and ingredients as well.  The only problem I had was with the slow service. The cashier was writing all the orders down by hand really slowly and I stood there while she wrote the last person's order for a couple of minutes without much acknowledgement from her or the many people working behind the counter. The crêpes, something I have experience getting fairly quickly, took a pretty long time. My coffee was brought to my table without creamer or without being asked about cream and there was no cream at the self-serve bar - all of which I found odd. It was a good thing I had no where to be or I would have been pretty upset.   However, the taste of the crêpes outweighs any time inconvenience I experienced this visit.

The machiatto coffee was really good with coconut milk . I ordered the Roasted Veggie wrap which comes out warm and with the tortilla grilled on the outside. When the plate was first put in front of me, I was a little surprised that it didn't come with a small side of hummus or salsa that typically accompanies wraps, and also missing was any side at all. No chips, grapes, fries, not even a pickle spear. Nothing at all. So it was a wrap on a big empty plate. I did ask for something for a sauce, and they were accommodating, and brought me some balsamic vinaigrette, and some vegan cheese they call Pleezsh. I will give them the wrap is delicious! The Pleezsh actually was the icing in the cake. It enhanced everything so much more. I will definitely be back when I'm in the area. However, I do think it is a bit spendy especially considering that there are no sides, and think that should be considered on their wrap or sandwich plates in the future.

The owner has a very dry sense of humor and can be quite entertaining to talk to.   There's a 10min for credit Cards here so bring cash. The pastries are decently priced and like delicious. I got some cupcakes for my friends birthday and he gave me free candles.  For myself, I got an order of their redbean mochi, which unfortunately, was a bit too mushy. The texture of the mochi was chewy enough and it broke down too easily. The redbean paste was good though, and wasn't over sweet to the palette.

It was the best scone I have ever had, so I asked him where he got it & he told me it was from this little coffee house called Steve's. I had to go and check it out myself. I got there right after they opened (about 5:30 in the morning) so they were not really busy yet, but the guys behind the counter both greeted me & one took my coffee order and the other grabbed me a scone.  The service was really fast & I was in and out in 2 minutes, which was GREAT because I needed to hurry up and get to work. Once I was at work I was able to sit down & enjoy what I ordered. I got the French Roast which was nice & bold as advertised. They use a French Press to brew all their coffee which usually means a 5+ minute wait at any other coffee house (not to mention you have to specifically request it at other places), but because this is their standard method they already had it ready to go. But the coffee was not even the best part. They had 2 different kinds of scones today; Chocolate Chip or Cranberry Orange. So I picked the Cranberry one & it was delish! Their scones are flaky but still moist & perfect. The tart cranberries were just what I wanted in the morning with the sweetness of the scone itself & the strong cup of coffee. The sign up front also said that they make all their treats from scratch! Great little place to stop in the morning. This was the perfect start to my Friday! I will definitely be back."}

The creation was almost too delicious to eat.  I was very impressed with how innovative and flexible they were to my friends request for a unique birthday creation.

They had a bunch of board games for us to play while we waited, that was a nice touch.  Walked back up to the bar to order since no one else came to us while we were seated, she was super friendly and informative. Great bartender. We got a beer flight and ordered our food and had to grab our own silverware,napkins,and water from a table by the door which was a little awkward having to hold all of that and walk back to your table.  Food came out about 15-20 min later, jackfruit slider and fries were awesome! Just wish they put more jackfruit and less purple cabbage. Biscuiys n gravy needs some work. Gravy tasted like cinnamon and cloves and was more sweet than hearty and savory. Husbands omelet was a little skimpy, he said it was underseasoned and needed a protein in it. The rosemary chocolate chip cookie was so so delicious.  All in all i will be back because i want so bad for vegan restaurants to succeed, being a vegan myself.

The reviews so far have been a bit harsh given our experience. Our cupcake (salted caramel) was quite good. It could have been a bit more moist, and others have noted this (let's hope the 'Cakes' staff is reading these).  The decor is nice, and the 'open kitchen' concept works well.  With some slight adjustments to their recipe, they could really be a hit.  The place does have a spartan look right now, but as with everything else I give them the benefit of the doubt and expect they'll make changes or not make it. They've barely been open a week!  As for the price, given that this is what they make and virtually all they sell, I think to come in, sit at the counter, eat a cupcake with a glass of water and chat for 15 minutes with a server, $3.25 is hardly enough for them to stay in business. Cupcake vs. latte at $3.25? Cupcake wins. My feeling is that they should perfect the cupcake and keep the price.  We'll revisit our review after our next visit in a few weeks."}

It's a great place to hang out, whether alone or with a friend, as it's very relaxed and you won't feel crowded or rushed out. They have a great selection of food and drinks and I've enjoyed everything I've had there. I particularly like the falafel wrap.   Where things start to get spotty is the service. Prepare to be ignored and count yourself lucky if you get timely, friendly service. On one occasion the server flatly ignored me for a good five minutes because she was too busy talking on her blu-tooth and wandering around the place aimlessly. I will say that the service seems to slowly be getting better, but even so the norm seems to be to ignore the customer until they're 'ready' to acknowledge you.

I think that this is the third Nutella latte I've had in the city and by far, it has been the best.  I can actually taste the Nutella (although not that much but I have kind of a sweet tooth anyway).  Not to mention, the rest of the beverage itself was nice and smooth.  For $5, I also think that the size of the drink makes it an excellent value.  I would recommend, however, that they include a small spoon so you can eat the Nutella 'dregs' at the bottom once you've finished!

Of the two Barnes and Noble's in my usual territory, I must admit that I prefer the South Park location.  This one seems like it might be a little bigger with more books, but it's also older (which isn't necessarily a bad thing) and tends to be overrun with teenages when school's out (which definitely can be a bad thing).  Also, the coffee shop is right smack dab in the middle of the store, which is a bit exposed for my taste.  I know that's a personal issue, but I imagine there are at least a few other people who don't like being set on a pedastal in the middle of a huge store when drinking coffee.

I dropped in to grab a drink and got tempted by the Roasted Tomato and Goat Cheese Scone ($7.50) which actually is sourced from Baker & Scone. The scone was heated before it was brought out to me and was quite good. Although the scone itself was a little denser and more bready than I prefer, there was a very nice herby flavour; and biting into it, you can see all the beautiful layers built in. But what made the scone stand out was the layer of goat cheese and toasted tomatoes on top. The tart, earthy flavour of the goat cheese mixed incredibly well with the herbs in the scone and the roasted tomato added an amazing pop of concentrated savoury sweetness which was both light and refreshing when contrasted with the goat cheese. The warmed goat cheese also added a wonderful velvety and creamy texture to the scone.  For a drink I got a chai latte ($5.25) and although it was beautifully presented, the latte was watery, weak in flavour and lacking in texture. There was a good amount of cinnamon on top to help decorate the drink but it was not enough to redeem the latte.  Unlike the Dupont location, I did see a small price list for the drinks sitting on the counter and the scones were all priced with little signs so you know how much you'll be paying before you order. The space is very nice and quite instagrammable. Large and airy, there's lots of character with signs bearing interesting facts hung on the walls and tvs airing funky artsy clips.

My key indicator is my kids, and they both did not like the donuts - too sweet and to messy with the glaze was the common theme.   The prices in this location are high for the products received. Again, the service is stellar and the fact that they fill fresh donuts with the filling of choice to order is unique and very cool. I'm simply not a fan of the donuts as they are.

I looked at the flavors and she said 'there are other small ones in the cooler. But we don't have pink ice cream.' The place was empty and now I can see why. The staff is rude and treats customers poorly. We left and went to Jarlings where we are always treated well. Can't wait for the hipster dessert trend to die and for this place to close.

It is a coffee shop that I think Frasier and Niles Crane would frequent and become regulars there. The coffee is quite robust and rich. The tea is suitably exotic. The space is well-organized, clean, and sparse. There is a wall of quotations that is terribly inspiring, everything from loving coffee to madness. The other wall is under-decorated, but it does have a wonderful vintage sign that says, 'Hand over the coffee and no one gets hurt.' I like that. You will like this place, too. The bookcase lends this place an air of sophistication that you usually only find in serious cities that have buildings dating earlier than the 1970's. Price is a bit extravagant for coffee, but you expect that in downtown Summerlin."}

In fact, their corned beef hash is my gold-standard for judgment: with poached eggs and a little Tabasco, there are very few comparable meals as far as deliciousness goes.  The menu is pretty comprehnsive, and features, for instance, flapjacks.  Flapjacks, people ... flapjacks.  Name me another place in town that you can order flapjacks and I'll be impressed.  Anyway, the only thing that keeps this from being a five-star joint in my book is the fact that no matter how hard I try, I can't seem to get out of here for less than $20.  Maybe I'm crazy, but for a traditional American breakfast, I think that's expensive.  That doesn't seem to keep people - including myself - from frequenting the place, but on general principle I need to dock a star."}

I had chips as a side, but my one complaint was that the only options are sea salt and barbecue, and I prefer plain. After my meal was finished, I ordered a raspberry scone and cinnamon roll.

Now, the cupcake selection itself was a touch limited. This past Saturday there was only one ('confetti' - their take on the Pillsbury classic 'funfetti') that wasn't chocolate or pumpkin. One white-cake crowded by chocolate, chocolate lavender, black and white, and red velvet (chocolate cake died red). Um, variety is the spice of life? At least they offer variety in the size of the cupcakes (mini to large).   But the coffee!! Three cheers for French Press Coffee! You get to take the whole little tureen back to your table to enjoy at your leisure (one french press contains about 4 cups of coffee). As true coffee connoisseurs will agree, the tastiest coffee comes from french presses.   Overall, the place is adorable and clearly beloved as it was nonstop busy throughout our stay. I will definitely be back on my next trip to downtown Champaign."}

I told him I was going back home (I was visiting from out of state) and he told me he would be able to call me if he found it and have it shipped to my local Barnes and Noble.

It is family friendly as well as I have seen alot of moms toting kids after working out and there is never usually a line at any point of the day. I cannot vouch for the food yet, but she does have a daily special of the day (It was meatloaf today for $5.95) and a bunch of sandwiches including her famous egg salad. I usually have some iced beverage and my order has either been the Mocha Frappe or the Iced Mocha, both for about $4 each. They were very tasty and she doesn't skimp on the size either - they are all  large. You can sit at the counter or pick among smaller tables, couches and even an easy chair or take your stuff outside to the tables there. It's in a strip mall, but the White Cup Coffee sign is very visible and it's next to pizzeria.

Staff are very very polite and welcoming. Great giant cupcake selection of high quality and high satisfaction. Real plates and forks for pastries. Sometimes the barista will grind the coffee beans by the cup making for an excellent cup of coffee!  Minuses:  Sometimes the barista will use the drip coffee already prepared in the carafe making for a stale cup of coffee.  Have to ask for creamer. Poundcake slices are dry and have a little preservative taste to them. Outside seating is noisy because it is near the shopping center entrance.

Our waitress returned a bit later to tell me they were out of tongue tip and regular tongue. I asked if this was normal and she couldn't really say. I settled on a philly cheese steak. All I can say is both sandwiches were a disappointment. Small servings and the philly might have just been two pieces of bread and a sprinkling of meat. Onions, peppers, cheese?  To beat it all on our way out we saw a sign on the door that said this is a place of peace no firearms. When will people learn that criminals don't read or care about signs. My wife and I were both armed and managed to get through our sub par meal without disturbing anyone. Armed citizens are a deterrent to crime and not a danger. If you want to prevent lawful CCW post your sign better. As per the law. I guess I'll never get to find out about that tongue sandwich now. Bummer!"}

Par contre, dès que nous nous sommes installés à une table, son attitude a légèrement changé. Elle ne nous a pas offert un excellent service, mais bon... Disons que c'était passable. L'ambiance du restaurant était très chouette, je n'y serais p-e pas restée des heures à lire vu que c'était assez bruyant (l'heure du brunch quand même), mais j'ose croire qu'en semaine c'est plus tranquille et idéal pour lire ou étudier calmement.   Passons à la nourriture...Mon omelette était vraiment excellente et bien cuite. Elle était remplie de bons légumes, miam! Mon assiette était si chargée, je n'en ai mangé que le quart, mais j'aurais aimé l'engloutir en entier tellement c'était bon. Mon latté était aussi excellent! Mon copain, n'a malheureusement pas tellement aimé son assiette de gauffre et jambon à la bière. Il ne l'a trouvé que correcte, sans plus.

After I decided to order the cappuccino I glanced at the drinking menu on the counter so I started debating maybe go for one of their selection of pour overs , looking more exotic with good amount of choices. I also inquire about where is the bean from the one they use for espressos  ( they have more than 3 kinds of beans for espresso ) with the info I happily decided to go with the cappuccino. He smiled at me and said I could come back to try the pour over !

My now husband and I went in for the tasting which the glavors were amaxing and they were great to work with. They really worked with us and figured out some changes that we could make that would get us the price range we wanted. I have been in the food industry for year so paying $5+ a slice was something I refused to do. Our cake was suppose to have fondant on the bottom tier and buttercream on the top 2 with different flavors in each tier. Out wedding day came and they were suppose to deliver the cake at 12pm, as our ceremony was at 4 and I wanted to make sure our photographer had enough for photos, well 3pm rolled around and no cake. I had My sister call and they told her the driver got stuck in traffic and was 20mins away. My sister then went to talk to my now husband and he had just called as well and they told him they had just left the store (we were getting married in Queen Creek which is a good 1.5hrs from their store). This really frustrated me as why lie? Plus we paid an extra $100+ for delivery and it wasnt there. The cake finally made right as we were finishing our ceremony at about 4:45pm. The cake looked beautiful but was all fondant, late, and the top tier was leaning. We took the top layer home and because it was 4 layers we took the top 2 off and I immediately found out why it leaned. It looked as though the cake broke or was dropped and the middle was crumbled making it to where the straws used to support the cake couldn't stand up straight. Overall the cake was good and for the most part beautiful but on someones wedding day you shouldnt be 5hrs late and and least apologize (which hasnt happened yet). At this time I'm unsure as to if i would use them again or recommend them to others. The stars are because of being so late and lying to sister as the cake was beautiful dispute the leaning and not being exactly what we ordered."}

I realize it's controversial to criticize a place's overwhelming popularity and slow turnover, but it really does detract from its appeal for me.  If I knew I didn't have to expect to wait 1.5 - 2.0 hours for a table every single time I went, I'd come here a lot more frequently.  What spares S&L a 'meh' 3-star rating are the sterling service and great fun quotient.  It's more than just a novelty -- it really is a great, workable idea that is an excellent alternative to yet another night of tipping expensive pints, and the perfect option for a cold, boring afternoon.  Just come prepared to wait a really, really, really long time for a table.  S&L has a truly gobsmacking array of games for any number of players, and their knowledgeable staff can teach you the rules and make excellent recommendations based on your preferences.  They introduced me to several great new games.  My recs for 2-person games: Bananagrams, Geistes Blitz (this is *so much* fun!), and Elk Fest.  As well as the classic Set, and Yahtzee.  The food and coffee are merely OK -- definitely room for improvement on both scores.  Draft beer would also be a welcome enhancement.  80% of the time I've come here, I've been told to expect a 1.5 - 2.0 hour wait.  This means that my nights at S&L have either been canceled on site, or involved 2 hours at a bar waiting for the call.  On one such recent occasion, the guy at the door told me he'd call in 90 minutes, 'probably less.'  When I checked in with him, not having received a call, he claimed he'd told me it would be about 2 hours, which simply wasn't true.  This issue has made S&L unworkable for anything but the laziest of evenings / afternoons and eliminated it as a real Fri./Sat. nite bar alternative, and that's kind of a shame."}

Starbucks you say? The one @ southdown is too small with people constantly coming and going (and it's dang cold in the winter there). The one @ South Common suffers similar problems. The one @ Dundas and Erin Mills is way too busy.   Second cup? N/A  iCoffee (a nice little find I made in Clarkson) - great, but open til 5pm.  Enter Artisano.    1) It's a bakery/cafe, so you get good food (priced around $10), half decent coffee ($2), and a variety of baked snacks ($2-5).    2) It's big, so you can find your own little corner. Also big enough that you're not distracted by hustle and bustle (population density).  3) It's quiet, at least, quiet enough when you throw on a pair of headphones.  4) And there are plugs!  5) It's open til 9-9:30pm daily.

Additionally, they have a variety of scrumptious cookies (check out the Cowboy cookie!), a fairly priced yogurt parfait, and tasty tasty scones.

I quite liked the place as it is priced much like other cafes in Montreal, the staff was accommodating (of my terrible French), and the relaxed ambiance.

Most cafes that I've been to in Montreal seem to use the same beans while Hoche Cafe uses Metropolis Beans (I think they are from a coffee roaster in Chicago but I may have read this incorrectly).

They have an absolutely HUGE selection of drinks, both bottled and freshly made, which is awesome. They also have sandwiches on the menu that look pretty tasty, though I never think to try them. I go in with one of two options in mind: donut or Thai iced tea.  The only downside to this place, for me, is the electronic bell that screams at you as you enter and exit. Holy hell, is that thing nerve-wracking. I realize that there are only one or two people manning the place at once and they need to be alerted from all the way in the back when people come in. But unless they want to give people tinnitus, they should really consider lowering the volume on that thing.  Another thing that seems a bit disconcerting is that this place is a ghost town every time I visit. I've never been in during the AM hours, so I can't comment on how busy they are at peak donut time. But in the late afternoon/night, there's usually nobody else in sight. Which is fine by me, as I get faster service.

There are people waiting by the cash register for their to go coffee and it feels congested. But that's the only downside of this neat place.   When I sat down at the table to wait for my meal I was given a tiny bowl of homemade granola that was a salty and sweet  and the perfect tapas to nibble on before my mushroom Ragu crep was delivered. My crep came out quickly and it was delicious! There was a little serving of beautifully seasoned sea salt on the side of the plate which parred perfectly with the crep.    At the end of the meal I was served a dessert tapas of homemade rose scented marshmallows that are toasted at the table by the server and drizzled with dark chocolate. To die for.   I will definitely be going back! I can't wait to try everything on the menu!"}

Not just because they give you a little square of chocolate with your drink (they do), not because their coffee is delicious (it is), not because the place is just so much prettier than Starbucks (also true)...I love Aroma for their tea. LOVE. I absolutely hate when I order tea and it's a tea bag that I could buy myself. I appreciate real herbs, real tea leaves that might be a little bit more difficult for me to prepare at home.  Which is why I love their Mint tea. Mmmmm.  I also adore their frozen coffees in the summer. It's an awesome summer drink with no frills -- Coffee, Ice, Milk. And I think that's exactly how it should be."}

Even though Subway was currently making fresh bread (pleasant enough smell, but they're no MJ Breads), I decided to spend my money at a non-franchise and see what they were all about.  Coming into any bike shop you'll expect the smell of rubber from all of the tires, and yes, that's what you're greeted with.  No fresh smelling breads here, but, let's give this place a chance...  I was greeted warmly by the young staff and I saw that they had a caprese sandwhich on the menu, which is among my favorite type of sandwich if I'm thinking of vegetarian style...so I ordered it along with a lemonade.  To my shock, the young guy at the counter made the lemonade fresh to order, squeezing the lemons in a mexican squeezer, you know the type.  Fantastic.  If I go back again, it may be for the lemonade, it was that fresh and delicious.  The caprese sandwich, once I got home was pretty good.  It seemed to be on a light sourdough bread, fresh tomatoes, basil and pesto with a nice slice of mozzarella and some olive oil.  I'll definitely go back.  No more Subway for me in this plaza!  I also noticed that they have a nice coffee bar with very good looking treats for the mornings.  If you are in the neighborhood, check it out!  I think you'll like it!"}

{"bus_id":"M0yfSpeDaYTPEnLjw_0g_g", "text":"My thoughts and comments: Agreed with all the 1 start comments with our experience with Baker Wee.  We have purchased many items from here, special ordered cakes and cookies.  Recommended to other people and saw great results.  But this last time, and I mean last time my sons cake was the saddest cake I ever saw.  (Please see photo)  This place can make beautiful cakes we see them every time we go in, we have had beautiful desserts made for us.  It is simply baffling how you can go from Great to terrible in weeks.  Must be dependent on the baker you get.  Also agreed about no cake book just the one ipad.  All I can say is get it together Baker Wee you have wonderful potential just poor execution.    Adding my wife's thoughts, be glade this is not 2, 1 Star reviews  I have been a customer since 2014 and have always loved Baker Wee and recommended them to others. My previous cake orders have been great, so I was very disappointed to see my son's $70 birthday cake. No border on top, awful lettering, and obviously what I communicated about the photoscan placement did not translate properly. I asked that the photoscan not take the whole cake because it'd be nice to have room to place toys and write Happy Birthday... the order form said 'make photoscan kinda small,' geeze I wish I noticed that she wrote that. Even so, if the lettering and bordering was done nicely- it would have looked so much nicer. I feel like I got the trainees working on my cake. I'm sorry, but trainees should start in the grocery stores (which I have bought cakes from many times and am much less critical cause I know what I'm paying for), when I order from a baker, I am expecting a professional.  The sad part is, we expressed our disappointment when we picked it up- they did add a border (which was sloppy) on top, but that was it, no attempt to fix the lettering, no apology, nothing. Maybe a manager was not around, but employees should be trained to express 'I am so sorry, we will have a manager contact you' to an unhappy customer. I'm so disappointed.   To say the least we had a terrible experience no one apologized.  ***Bakery Wee it is up to YOU to contact US to make this right, not for us to contact you.  We were in the store and expressed our dissatisfaction and YOU did NOTHING."}

I felt like the lady behind the counter was pushing me to make a decision so I just ended up ordering a Burek (spinach and cheese filled pastry) to go for $4.15.  She warmed it up for me and I ate it when I got back to the office.   It was really, really flakey with lots of filling but I thought it needed a bit of salt.

You can choose from a menu of 5 dishes, including chicken or fish cutlet, an combine it with a small menu of select drinks. I'm not sure if these menus ever change because the choices in their drink menu were really random. I got the fish cutlet with a hot lavender milk tea for a little over $10.   The food itself was fine; essentially 2 cutlets with some rice and a few vegetables. It's nothing fancy but it's not like you're expecting much anyway. I've never tried flower-infused milk tea before though so I was pleasantly surprised with how the drink turned out. A nice, hot cup of milk tea with a subtle floral tone actually works really well together. There were little bits of lavender inside the tea too which I ended up chewing..... Whether that's normal or not idk but I didn't mind it, I was just caught off guard the first time.   The place wasn't that packed either even though I was there 8-10, which was a pleasant surprise. Parking however was still horrendous though since more things are opening around the area and the terrible layout of the upper level parking. If you ever go, just park underground instead and spare yourself from the trouble, especially with half the people not knowing when to stop and how to park in the lot...."}

Starbucks is more of a habit for me that began back in my Vancouver days.  I LOVE being able to browse the book store with a fresh coffee in hand.  Some day's the coffee tastes good, some days it tastes like the beans have been over roasted or burnt.  It has always baffled me how the taste of coffee can be so inconsistent from Starbucks to Starbucks.  I agree with Geoff in that they need to get better at attending to their always overflowing garbage's.    My habit keeps me drinking dry cappuccinos, espressos...sometimes green tea lemonades in the summer and maybe once a year I treat myself to a frappuccino.

They had put mashed potatoes on the plate instead of red potatoes. My colleague kindly mentioned this and asked for red potatoes instead.

It's a new building and the Sweet Dough staff appreciates it. They maintain a higher standard of cleanliness than many other bakeries I've visited. All staff members wear gloves when handling food products and keep aprons on at all times. Being able to see the whole team working on creating the dough masterpieces, is always a great way to determine the real dedication behind the food.  The donuts are a bakery quality, too. You can tell they aren't mass produced and a corporate dough was just 'baked' in house. They take their time with each cream filled donut, ensuring there is a decent space for the cream by carefully puncturing one side and not driving a stake through the whole donut. I appreciate the ability to be creative yet stocking the case with delicious classics. Sometimes, you might want a vanilla dipped, Oreo sprinkled, caramel drizzled donut and other times the glazed croissant is just crazy enough for the day.   Honestly, very glad to have Sweet Dough join the Fort Mill community. I hope they have been welcomed with open arms as well as they have opened their arms to this town."}

The cookie is packed with chocolate chips, macadamia nuts, walnuts and almonds. I'm not a fan of nuts in cookies but I will definitely be back for this decadent baby. The pain au chocolate was easily the best I've had in Toronto so far and came a solid second behind some of the amazing ones I had while visiting Paris. All in all, excellent experience and will definitely be back for more."}

Ancora makes their own beans, too, which are a regular standby in my house. My favorite are the Ancora D'oro and Black and Tan.

The side orders of cauliflower, Brocatini(or whatever it's called) were a pile of mush covered with something. The swordfish I ordered was a dried out small piece of fish. The person next to me ordered the trout and it looked and tasted like salmon fish sticks. The only good thing about my entire meal was the slices of dry bread. One of the other people at our table ordered the steak and that was even bad. No one really said anything during our meal but when we got into our Uber Cab we all opened up and unanimously agreed that this was some really bad food. Our Uber driver said that he's heard horrible things about the place lately and would never recommend it to anyone.  PS. I think I heard the waiter say 'The Chef' does this, 'the Chef does that' over 15 times during our meal. The Chef needs to be fired in my opinion. I've had better food at Applebee's.

{"bus_id":"l9QMOv3_RIUteG0wJc82SA", "text":"I honestly can't tell the difference between different bubble tea places. However, what I love about Formocha is they definitely put a lot of love and time into making your bubble tea. I tried the roasted oolong milk tea with grass jelly and somehow, it tastes more refreshing and just higher end than like maybe presotea or any of the other chains (excluding chatime, chatime has a soft spot in my heart)  What is also unique about this bubble tea place is they offer Taiwanese wheel cakes. Think of it like sweet buns sandwiching a filling. I believe it's a popular street food item in Taiwan and I remember the last time I had such a thing was in Montreal at a small mom and pop shop restaurant. Their oven/stove to make these cakes are definitely imported over.   So Formocha makes several flavors: black sesame, oreo, ,custard, red bean etc. I've tried most of the flavors and my favorite is the custard and the black sesame. Really you can't go wrong with any flavor, but they are so tasty. They are not only soft, but piping hot and delicious with a nice balance of sweetness from the filling. It's better to eat them on the spot and not take them around like cupcakes. Their shelf life of tastiness decrease over time.  Anyways, I ended up getting a loyalty card but ended up not being loyal at all. This is mostly because the location is out of the way for me. But! If I ever pass by the neighborhood, I do make it a point to grab both a bubble tea and some wheel cakes."}
{"bus_id":"Wfx3lulJt9QZt10gCytTxw", "text":"I'm a bit disappointed in this place.  I was honestly expecting Red Elephant Chocolate Cafe to be similar to the excellent Chocolaterian Cafe on Atwood.  Red Elephant serves only sweets.  They offer an assortment of chocolatey things, including ice cream.  You can order a glass of wine, hot chocolate or try some of their (not very good-tasting) chocolate tea.  But they do not offer sandwiches or anything savory.    I've tried a couple of their chocolates, and was not impressed.  Their version of a pecan turtle was awful, tasting too sweet and a little bit odd.  A dark chocolate coconut truffle was okay.  When chocolates are sold for several dollars apiece, they have to be better than this.  Kilwin's is just down the street, which does not bode well for Red Elephant, as Kilwin's chocolates are delicious.  I also tried the hot chocolate, which was quite good...but expensive.  The chocolate tea was very light in flavor, and I would not order it again.  The layout is strange too.  There are plenty of tables, but a retail display is crammed in the middle of the seating area.  The decor and ambiance are also a little off.  It's hard to even notice this place exists, due to poor signage.  The competition has freshly made sweets on display in the windows.  You gotta do better, Red Elephant.  Overall, the concept doesn't really work.  I'll perhaps go back and try a few other things, but so far not really a fan.  I'm tempted to go back and try the chocolate coffee, but know it would probably cost $5 just for coffee with a little chocolate sprinkled on top.  In Madison, there are much better places to buy chocolate and plenty of better cafes.  Since this place just opened, I'll try and give them a second chance.  But after a couple of visits, I'm not impressed."}

I thought the experience was pretty cool, perhaps ghoulishly cool.  We parked around the corner, and once we were on the street we walked right past it.  There isn't a sign or anything but because of all the pictures on yelp I recognized it just as I passed it.  We walked in, and right into what could be an art exhibit.  Or a garage sale, depending on your point of view.  Even the bathrooms are loaded with stuff.  Other restaurants that use pieces of Americana as decor are mere imitators of this place.

The service was quick but then again we only ordered two cookies and the nutella hot chocolate.   At $4.75, the small nutella hot chocolate (with no whipped cream!) wasn't worth it. It was far too small for that price. Taste wise, it was sort of mediocre. Nothing special about it.   However, the cookies made up for the subpar hot chocolate! We ordered the chocolate chip and chocolate walnut cookies. It was delicious. The middle was soft and the chocolate was melty! The outer edge was crunchy. Best of both words and again, very delicious. They were big (in terms of diameter) and really thick (maybe 1'). The only downside is that they're probably upwards of 400 calories and they disappeared so quickly!   I would give my visit 4.5 stars.

I have tried my fair share of GTA patisseries that offer macarons in their menu, from this year's macaron day to my own macaron tours (versions 2010 and 2012). Ruelo is BY FAR still the best in the city.  Unless I haven't tried the macarons at a certain place, I have decided to just stick to Ruelo for macarons (with the exception of a lady that sells macs at the Aurora summer market - her pistachio flavour is very good!).  -1 star  A) They don't have all the macaron and cake flavours available.  They rotate except for the regular flavours.  B) Their macs and cakes are pricey. Macarons vary from $2.50 to $5.00 a piece. Single/mini cakes are over $5 a piece.  They use good quality ingredients, their cakes are very pretty and the macaron shells are the right texture. My fave mac flavours are creme brulee and salted caramel. Their Ruelo flavour, both macaron and cake will satisfy any chocolate lover.  Ruelo gets a solid 4 stars. Parking at Time Square can be a hassle and the shop can get real tight when it's busy.  Glad they opened their shop at Yonge n Eg, it's bigger and somewhat closer since I moved downtown."}

Not many seats and a menu small enough to fit on a 5x8 card, but the important thing is that they serve jackfruit. Yes, honey. Jackfruit - a special treat for folk who like variety in their vegetarian staples.  3 jackfruit sliders puleeeze! They held the mayo for me and still the bitty sandwiches were moist. Purple cabbage was crisp. Bread was lightly dry-toasted and soft. Perfect amount of fries, fried with skin on and not overly salted.  Will come again. Sho'nuff!"}

The new owner needs to get a fucking clue.  your help knowing when they're wrong just made it the worst situation.  As a top reviewer, I will make it my mission to expose everything about a business, and this type of stupidity, by a 20 something kid that had no interest in being honest was enough to get me to flip him off...his attitude was the worst I've dealt with in years and although I know better, I expect better.  Lastly, he hollers at me, I served you after we're closed...yet the sign said open, and the door was wide open...really?  What a worthless waste of 20something space...get a clue kid, if the door is open you own it...don't be a douchebag.  Do NOT waste your time here, the new owner has no flippin clue what his staff is doing and as a result, you're drop in business is due to that...best wishes, looking forward to the next business to take it's place.

The crepe itself is good but the real star of the show is the pork belly.  It is so tender, sweet, and succulent. And the maple sauce just takes it over the edge. Luckily the portion isn't too big or else you would probably go into a coma after eating this much deliciousness.  My boyfriend had the first time and really loved it. Bananas and Nutella, can't really go wrong. Both crepes were presented beautifully and we even got a free treat to snack on while we waited for our food.

{"bus_id":"y-ytZFbfRWvYma9P4g7AYA", "text":"Cute little place on the corner of Spring Mtn. and Jones, across the way from Cafe Moda. It reminds me of my favorite place in SoCal, Little Saigon/Seoul: cozy atmosphere with good drinks for a reasonable price. F.C. has a nice hang-out vibe- k-pop posters on color walls, two? TVs playing k-pop mvs (when I was there)- and the service is very friendly.   I'm a bit of a stickler with boba here, I've found it difficult to find similarly good boba drinks (needs a certain level of squish and flavor) for reasonable prices like in SoCal (where I feel there's heavier competition for boba places). You get both here.   Bought two large boba teas for $3.95 (50%). Of course, with the economy, the prices may not stay the same. My peach tea was great, and I definitely did appreciate it being less sweet/syrupy.   My brother, also picky, liked the almond milk tea. He even bothered to ask where I got it (he's not much of a talker). Boba's a little on the soft side but still got a nice level of squish and held up well even after an hour (I'm a slow drinker).   Great place overall, I hope to go back soon and try some of their snack foods. :)"}

To me it's definitely the lychee jellies that make the tea awesome. I also tried their grilled pork banh mi but sadly it's not the bomb. I've had better elsewhere. Not only that, they do not put alot of meat in there. They were definitely being cheap about that, however, the meat honestly tasted good and well marinated. The picked carrots and daikon didn't even have a pickled taste. That was disappointing because I do like the pickled taste in a banh mi.   Also, I did get a green milk tea to go with boba.

It was first week so talk about the hype or clearly the hype was real when line out the door at the worst time to go. I like come back for lunch. Once I realize that there food menu not that big cause they really known more for the drinks. I had second thoughts but with all the hype had to come check it out for myself.  First impression is like the interior it very modern, very much open area, nice diversity of seating arrangements, open kitchen see them make all the drinks, and good vibe. I went afternoon to avoid crowd. I settled for the Mangonada. I love the color of the drink. Really all the drinks I saw while was there was very colorful, garnishes give it nice touch, and got loads of personality. I decided pass on the whole mamgo twist extra. If there one thing have mix feelings about with all these fancy tea drinks popping up around Vegas. I am old fashion drinks should be about the drink not the fluff. I enjoy the Mangonada. Yes it was bit sweet but my experience found all these same type of specialty drinks tend to be sugar overload to point. It had nice balance. The seasoning or keep thinking mexican style put that seasoning on any kind of fruit.  I would order it again.   Food never knew it was small portion of the menu or basically only fried chicken (popcorn chicken). I went with popcorn chicken in box. You have three different sauce you can get with it. I went with salt and pepper off employee recommendation. I agree it nice neutral flavor of the three. Say if you get extra dipping sauces it the way to go. The fries again have couple options and again went with employee recommendation of cajun fries. It was ok. I think the cheetos fries is the one should have got but next time. The fries itself nothing special basic cut fries. I like the fact generous with the amount of celery and carrot sticks. The fact that everything is temperature hot!!!

The first time, we showed up 30 minutes before closing and were denied service of anything except coffee or the small pastries on the counter because the kitchen was closed. In a normal restaurant I can totally understand this, but it only takes 5 minutes and a hot plate to make a crepe so I was a bit turned off by this. The second time we showed up with plenty of time before closing. We were told that we could order crepes, but that it would be a 40 minute wait. We asked if there was a special occasion and they said that this is just a typical Saturday for them. Perhaps they should consider purchasing another hot plate? I love crepes, but not enough to wait 40 minutes. The third time we went was today and we finally got our crepes! My crepe was ice cold when I got it. My fiancé's however was luke warm. The crepe, though it was cold, actually tasted good and I think it could have been great had it not been so cold. I've been to Paris numerous times and know what a good crepe tastes like.

Many college joints tend to let cleanliness slide, but Joe Maxx has definitely not shown to be one of those locations. As for the coffee, I have a very diverse taste profile, and can enjoy anything from the sweetest mocha to a straight black cup of joe. Looking at the menu, I was indecisive as to which side of the spectrum I wanted to venture, so I had the barista make me his favorite drink. He actually went above and beyond to consider my taste, and didn't just give me the easiest drink he could put together, which was appreciated (the drink was also delicious).

It's super caffeinated though--I drove back to LA high and wired!  I got the spiced version, which has subtle flavors of clove, cinnamon, and cardammon(?)  The owner was so nice and even explained to me how a Toddy is made.  They even have supplies in the store if you want to try and make your own at home.  Everything in the store is FAIR TRADE and ORGANIC.  You can also purchase loose leaf teas and coffee beans by the pound.  I got 2oz (about 10-12 servings) of Blueberry Rooibos tea for $5!  What a steal!  Definitely check this place out--I read a sign on the door that said they are trying to change ownership, so hopefully this place will not go by the wayside.

In fact I was in the store on 3/23 and purchased a dozen and asked if there was an issue if I came in and purchased 3 dozen and I was told no.  Now 3/24 I stop by to purchase 3 dozen and I am told that anything over 2 dozen needs to be requested at least 2 days in advance.  I am a business major and I understand having product on hand so that your case is not empty but I would never turn a customer away or even make it seem as if it were an issue because my product is being purchased instead of being thrown out.  I was told that this time I could purchase 3 dozen but for future I would have to place an order.  This isn't the type of customer service I enjoy and I can take my purchases else where this isn't the only place that sells French macarons.  I believe you need to re-evaluate what the purpose of your company is, are you wanting to make a profit or be left with inventory? Not to mention the lack of customer service, you may want to let all your staff know that any large orders need to have at least 48 hour notice because it doesn't seem to be common knowledge."}

You order at the bar and seat yourself as well as get your own waters and silverware. Cute little converted historic home so we liked the atmosphere though it does get very crowded so seats can be hard to find at times.   Food prices were OK, a bit steep but not way out of line. Flavor wise everything was just OK. A few of us got the avocado toast and the toast was pretty burnt and the pesto looked pretty old, very dark. The avocado was tasty and perfectly ripe. Another got the breakfast burrito and we liked it better than the toast. 2 avocado toasts, add 1 egg to each and also 2 drip coffees with reasonable tip and tax came to about $35.    The drip coffee was pretty bad. Very strange sour taste to it, we could hardly drink it. Not quite satisfied with the coffee one of us went and purchased their Horchata w/ espresso and it was delicious, best thing all day. We purchased a scone to go which was pretty dry and not a bunch of flavor.   Overall some things were OK, some not as good and some bad. Staff was friendly but nothing that stood out as great. We may give it another try just in case we caught them on an off day."}

Yes, the ambiance is nice, but I imagine if I brought my parents here, they would think it looked cheap. If you're young (or young at heart) and looking for a cutesy cafe to take pictures to post to your instagram, this could be your new favorite place. I was disappointed that I didn't get any figures on my tray (because almost everyone's pics on yelp have a figure with them), but it wasn't something I would go crying to the barista over.   I ordered an apple tea and my friend ordered the Snow Geisha tea. I enjoyed mine but it wasn't anything super special. My friend hated her tea (yes, she picked it based off the name... haha) but that's just her personal taste I suppose.   The barista was nice, but I didn't realize they had a loyalty card because I wasn't offered one. Not a big deal to me. It wasn't that crowded so my friend and I were hoping to hop into the volkswagen tent, but the second it emptied, a group of high school girls ran to it :(. Nevermind that we were waiting first (not the fault of the cafe, but it speaks to the atmosphere there)... Lastly, a lot of the chairs and seating are really uncomfortable. We sat on the couch to the right once you enter which was comfy enough, but the 'table' in front doesn't allow you to stretch your legs out! Sucks being tall! We moved to the 'dining table' across from us and those chairs weren't comfy at all.   Oh well. I live near Serenade (on S Rainbow) and a Sambalatte and those places are amazing.

All the workers here are extremely laid back and make you feel at home. Our server circled around our area a couple times in case anyone needed to flag her down as well as to make sure everything was OK. She was super nice.  The prices here for drinks are pretty decent. A little more expensive than regular cafes, but they have latte art so that makes up for it, hahaha. We didn't get any food, but I'll have to try it at least once because all the pictures look really good.  They also have a couple 'Game Masters' hanging around whom you can go to to get advice on which games to play or if you need an explanation on how a game works. I didn't get the name of the guy who helped our table the entire time we were there, but he made the experience really great. He explained things very quick and easily and even recommended us 3 really fun games when we asked for something 'quick, but fun, for 6 people'. If you ever need something quick and fun and for larger groups, look for the games 'Cockroach', 'For Sale', and 'Coup'.  All in all, I don't know how anyone could give this place a bad rating. It may be extremely loud and you have to raise your voice all the time, but that's the fun of it. The atmosphere is really energetic, yet casual, and everyone here is just having a good time and taking a breather from reality.

We went on a Friday night, so they were busy.  We decided to sit at the small bar while we waited for our table.  We ordered the crab cakes for an appetizer. They had a strong fishy odor when they arrived but they were very good with a hint of spiciness.  Only two small crab cakes arrived but just enough to hold off our hunger before dinner.  We had to wait approximately 40 minutes before we were seated.  My husband ordered the all you can eat haddock and I ordered the regular haddock dinner.  You have a choice of two sides.  My husband ordered the baked beans and seasonal vegetables (zucchini, broccoli and one piece of red pepper).  I ordered the seasonal vegetables and garlic mashed potatoes.  The garlic red mashed potatoes were a bit pasty but decent but in my opinion were over mashed.  The vegetables were done perfectly, with just a slight bit of crispiness.  The fish was good, hearty, crispy and non-greasy.  I had three decent size pieces of cod on my plate as well as my husband.  However, they brought out an additional plate of cod when they served us for my husband's all you can eat.  In our opinion, they should wait to bring out more cod, as it sits there and gets cold before you can even start eating it.  The place is very noisy as there is a very high ceiling, so it was hard to hear each other.  The ambience was mediocre because of this.  All in all, it was a decent Friday night fish fry."}

The menu seems slightly overpriced but you're obviously paying for the experience. I got tea which came in a cat-themed teapot. While waiting for the tea to cool, we got a chance to play with one of the cats who decided to awake from his slumber. They had some toys to engage the cats.

It was topped with whipped cream and blueberries. It's super simple that it was not enough to justify the drive.   The Bread Box reminds me of their take on honey toast, only in smaller pieces (or boxes). The bread's exterior was too toasty. It was hard to enjoy.

The place is often packed because of it's prime location. I see a lot of people sitting at tables for hours reading or working on their laptops. Purple Perk also doesn't seem to mind outside food since I frequently see a woman eating her own food brought in Tupperwares.   If you're in the area, you may notice Purple Perk.

The shitty part is the staff are fully aware of whats about to happen to you, but they don't tell you this upfront.  this place would be amazing if only it were bigger....clearly the concept is cool and fun. for now, they just need to work out the kink of managing wait lists and customer service."}

They had a menu with preset omelettes but they were in French so I tried to explain the omelette I wanted from the menu but the waiter said forget the preset menu and just say all the items I want in my omelette. So for the same price of $10 I got spinach, mushrooms, tomatoe, and cheese. Not a bad deal! The omelette also came with a decent amount of toasted bread that was delish. I am usually not full from an omelette but with the bread it was actually a very filling meal!  My husband ordered the bagel and lox and it looked great as well. He was very happy with it.

I've tried a  few other things there  the coconut cupcake, eh bought 2 ended up throwing one away again very dry and not fresh tasting.

That being said, I've always been a fan of Green Grotto tea rooms. It really is a nice place to relax, socialize with friends, and just do your own thing.  We were out on a Saturday night looking for a dessert/snack and other places were packed so we came to Green Grotto and didn't have to wait at all to be seated. The service here was actually pleasant and really friendly to my surprise.  While I wouldn't order any full meals, the snacks are decent here. We went for their (popcorn) salt and pepper chicken and it was straight out from the fryer. It was moderately crispy, and dusted with the chinese 'salt and pepper' - you can taste the mild hint of the sweetness coming from the five spice. It's very aromatic in a good way! The chicken grew on me as I kept on eating it.  We went with their hot brown sugar ginger grass jelly for the dessert and it was also pretty decent except for the fact that it wasn't as hot as we would have liked. Funnily we asked for hot water which was boiling hot (not our intent, but it worked) and adding that to the dessert immediately made it warmer and diluted the sugar water in a totally acceptable way (it was quite concentrated with ginger and sugar). The taro balls were good and chewy but their sweet potato and taro could have been steamed a bit longer as it was on the harder side."}

Usually I go to Costco and pick up their bagels, but my dad ever the bagel fiend, went online and hunted for a bagel bakery. Lo and behold - Bagel Cafe! So I googled it up, and looked at the Bagel choices - YUUUUMMMINESS! There are 22 varieties - japeno cheddar, asiago, spinach and feta, sourdough, the everything bagel! Ok mouth is watering now. You can call your take out order in, and have it ready for you even! So I picked out my bagel choices and handed my dad the list to walk in and get, and figured on a 10 minute wait or so. Two minutes later he's walking back out bagels in hand! So have to give mad props for prompt customer service! Will have to wait another time to eat out, but will definitely come back this way."}

And they don't call themeselves a bread co. for nothing. Their ciabetta that rode home with us in my carry-on was yummy for the tummy even 24 hours later.

They actively engage in great small talk with customers to get to know you and who you are. I am not used to having people be so nice out here in Phoenix. I personally chose apple pie ice cream which was a cinnamon flavored ice cream with apple pie actually folded it into it. Soooooo delicious!

Our table was in a pretty cramped area which I normally don't mind but few people would ever want to sit that close to my typical frazzled Sunday morning self.   Our food was average. I had a pecan waffle and OJ, the hubby had a short stack of yeast pancakes, home-style potatoes and OJ. It was all OK, our service was good and the check with tip totaled $26 (cash ONLY.)

The barista put in before pulling the shot just the way I like it. Good latte art. Nice crema to boot as well.

How sweet. It helped because my hubby was carrying our one month old in her car seat. Buddy, the owner and this young lady were all smile and very friendly. They explained the menu to me and told us how they cook everything. such great service. i could tell right away that this was a family owned place that made everything from scratch and really appreciated their customers. they treat you as if youve been going there for years. love that type of service. made me want to come here all the time, and i hadn't even tried the gyros yet.   I've always heard that lamb is gamey, but this lamb was cooked to perfection. It's very tender and sliced into bite size portions. The cucumber sauce stuff they put on top is very good, and thats surprising to me cause i can't stand cucumber. impressive. Tried the garlic fries & they are delish! Very innovative. Had never had such fresh garlic fries. Mmm, good. Yes, they do put a little too much garlic, but hey, what better way to keep the vampires away, hehe. Jk'ing. But garlic fries are only for the die hard garlic fans.. in which i am one.  Buddy came by twice to make sure our food was okay and to ask if we needed anything else, how sweet! the last time he came by, he offered us a sample of one of his sweets. Don't remember the name but i didn't like it. The hubby did. But Buddy gets an A+ for trying.  This is the place to go for lunch. We've been here a couple times since and will continue to do so.

The ice cream was really good, very elevated flavors, even though some were a bit off the wall. I appreciated the funny names, but it was hard to tell what they were without asking about almost every one. (Maleficent = vanilla ice cream colored blue/green with white chocolate chips, Arizona Sunrise = orange creamciscle, Hopeless Romantic = red velvet ice cream with cream cheese swirl). This wouldn't have been a problem, except the guy working the counter was SUPER rude. He berated the poor woman on front of me, not once but twice, because he said she was talking too low, even though the freezer case was humming super loud and he had music playing from a radio behind him. When it was my turn, I asked for two samples because I had pretty much figured out the other flavors based on questions the other customers had asked.  He told me he would have to 'cut me off' at two samples. I told him that was fine because that's all I asked for. The honey lavender was good, lots of lavender, which I thought was just a bit much. I didn't care for the Funky Monkey - it had a weird tasting banana flavor to it. I practically shouted my order at him so he could hear me. It was all super awkward and uncomfortable. I won't be going back any time soon, even though the flavors we chose were super tasty (Cookie Monster, mint and Cocoa Puffs). Sometimes you can't make up for customer service."}

We went in, and only had to wait for less than a minute for us to get a table in a full house. Our server, Ti, was EXCELLENT. She was very attentive, kind, and was super helpful when my mom accidentally spilled some ketchup on herself. We were very impressed with her service, that we gave her a handcrafted coap from our business that we run as a thank you.  I had the strawberry pancakes with over medium eggs and hashbrowns. She had the blueberry oatmeal with a side of eggs. It was so delicious, and It didn't make me feel super full and bloated that starched pancakes normally would. It's a huge benefit that they make whole wheat pancakes, with decent servings.   I like that they have the coffee pot and water pitcher readily available for you at the table. It takes pressure off the server and customer for when they want refills and how much of a serving they want.   The place was well lit, clean and the bathrooms were very clean too.

During any given month of the year I order takeout from this place at least 2 to 3 times a week. Today I called @ 920 am (Az time) to place a takeout order. I was asked to hold and waited 7 minutes. I ended the call since no one came back to the line and called again. The second time I was placed on hold for 5 minuets, I ended the call since no one came back to the line (again) & called back a 3rd time. During the 3rd attempt of calling to place an order I was placed on hold for 11 minutes. After the 11 minute hold the person who took my order didn't apologize for the wait. I find this to be very unprofessional and rude.  Moving on..... There is literally only one cash register available.

I tried to order cooked dishes to-go to bring home to my wife but apparently their stoves weren't working.  Pretty much half the menu was not an option today.  Though they apologized, this was a disappointing way to start a dining experience.  The spring rolls came first and I was impressed.   The portion size was large and their take on a peanut dipping sauce was fantastic.  The ingredients seemed fresh enough and I would definitely order these again on a follow-up visit.  Their pho was equally great.  The clear broth had a nice clean taste and the bowl was stacked to the brim with various cuts of meat.  If you're new to pho, the pho dac biet comes with well-done and rare flank steak, beef balls, tripe, tendon along with a hefty portion of thin rice noodles.   Accompanying the bowl is a side dish filled with bean sprouts, peppers, basil leaves, and limes.  First try the savory broth, then add to your heart and stomach's desire.  Overall a nice option for those late night cravings for pho.   I'll be returning to try their non-soup options in the future and hopefully add the 5th star to this review."}

A group of us stopped in on a Saturday morning and they had a brunch option to go along with the standard lunch menu.  After picking out my tea cup I sadly ordered a tea that was not a good fit for me, meh it happens.  Luckily, my friends are nice and shared theirs with me and those teas were good.  I ordered off the brunch menu and got the breakfast bake, which sadly again was not the best fit for me because it felt more like mashed potatoes instead of hash browns, a texture thing.  I did thoroughly enjoy the scones and lemon cake with blueberry topping.  I feel this place is a good spot with a ton of charm even though my menu choices didn't entirely line up with my tastes that day."}

We were a little disappointed by the lack of actual French groceries :( the cheese selection was not too far above Trader Joes, they didn't even have all of the classics like Beaufort, and classic chèvre.

Instead of the usual non-edible wedding guest favors, my husband and I opted to go with edible wedding guest favors. We decided on doughnuts because I LOVE doughnuts :)  About 1 month prior to my wedding, I reached out to Glaze Doughnuts and a handful of other doughnut shops. However, Dominic from Glaze Doughnuts clearly stood out with his prompt replies and genuine willingness to accommodate my special request for my wedding day. I informed him of my specific requests:  1) Provide 1 doughnut per guest as my wedding favor, to thank guests for attending   2) Provide additional doughnuts for my doughnut station, to allow guests to snack on or take home additional doughnuts  3) Stay within a set budget that I had allotted for my wedding favors Dominic suggested using mini doughnuts for my wedding favors and using a combination of mini doughnuts and doughnut holes for my doughnut bar which allowed me to stay within my budget. I was grateful for his helpfulness in accommodating my 3 requests.  **I placed the following order for my wedding favors: 15 dozen + 1 half-dozen glazed mini-donuts = 186 plain glazed mini-donuts **I placed the following order for my doughnut station: 4 dozen plain glazed holes = 48 holes 4 dozen chocolate mini-donuts = 48 chocolate mini-donuts 3 dozen vanilla mini-donuts = 36 vanilla mini-donuts 3 dozen cinnamon sugar mini-donuts = 36 mini-donuts  My dad and my brother picked up the doughnuts the morning of my wedding and said they were greeted by a friendly employee who already had my order neatly stacked, ready to be picked up.   Needles to say, my guests looooved the doughnuts. At the end of the reception, the doughnut bar was empty - everyone of our guests ate doughnuts or took extras to go. The morning after my wedding, a few of my guests even shared with me how tasty the doughnuts were.  Thank you Dominic and Glaze Doughnuts for helping to make my wedding reception a memorable event with your delicious doughnuts!"}

They will sub in different foods in your bowl or you can create and customize your own! Part of what makes this place so great.   They also have complimentary water infused with cucumber and raspberries.   Their meals are pretty healthy and delicious. Was fairly filling for me.   The bowls were prepped super quick, there weren't too many people in line however, so it went super quick.   They also jot down your name on the order which is neat! You'll know right away which bowl is yours or if staff want to ask you what toppings you want, they can just call out your name while you wait.   I would definitely come back and try some of their deserts!!  Love the beach vibe and decor in this place as well. It actually really does remind me of California and the food there!

Terrible.  Short of it is that I have come to distrust the coffee houses that have the baristas prepare the coffee, drip-style, in front of the customer.  To a place, I have found the end resulted (1) expensive and (2) disappointing.  That is true of JPH: nice Baristas, but the end result was bitter, watery with absolutely no redeeming flavor.  Sanka anyone?  The upside is that the Baristas were very friendly, and they were playing cool music.  So a star for that."}

I mean holy baked goodness this place has arguably the best cake in Pittsburgh. Rich, sweet, layered, tasty and real. Sweet baby Jesus, just thinking about it makes me sad I left a bite on the plate. DONT YOU JUDGE ME. Just kidding judge away, after a hefty meal, this slice is a sharer. Taking on a slice on your own is only if you have the room after dinner or whatever.   Running you around $7 for a slice, these cakes are clearly made the old-fashion way and with real ingredients- No preservatives, no bullshit. They have vegan options, which offends me because that's food discrimination, but I got over it shortly after my taste-buds simultaneously cried little tears of joy in my mouth. I tasted 3 different cakes but the one I devoured was the Pistachio, creme something something. I forgot the name because I blacked out from a flavor coma. WORTH EVERY PENNY.  The place also has plenty of coffee options cold-press, espresso,lattes, mochas etc etc etc. (I had a cold press which was perfect bitter counter to the sweet cake.)The environment is cool but no way of browsing a menu for what you want to drink and if you ask the lady behind the counter she will be smart and snippy with you. A real negative Nancy. Good thing I couldn't remember her after I blacked out from how good the cake she gave me was."}

The closest one I've came across was Boba Tea House. The staff are pretty friendly and you get a good amount of traffic from the cool kids that come through here, which is right up in my alley because I'm kinda young and it's a pretty chill place to meet new people. I brought my friends here once and we just watch sports (they have a lot of tvs with different sports on so you don't have to miss a game if two were going on).  The good: Their drinks are pretty much just like california. I'm really digging their fresh stuff like jackfruit and avocado smoothies. The red bean snow I save for my cheat days (if people don't know, it's really good and now you know) hahaha. I'm a big tea fan and their teas can be a bit strong. Their thai tea which is something I will grade a boba shop of, is a delight. I asked them about it and they brew their Thai tea for at least 6 hours. I believe them, because the lollicup i worked at in california (lollicup stockton off march lane) did the same.  The bad: I'm not too critical, but I think the place could use more lights. That's a preference to me though. I was attracted to the warm color walls they had, but at night they seem to have a couple's atmosphere.   My advice: Keep it up! I'll be dropping by soon for more boba.  My favorite: Thai Tea with boba, Honey black tea, raspberry snow with assorted jelly, and my holy grail red bean slush with red bean at the bottom."}

I came in on 12/29 and ordered a creme brulee coffee after seeing a commercial for it and thinking 'that sounds freaking fantastic'.   So. After waiting for 10 minutes in the drive thru to order, the menu was not clear and which coffee was the special flavor. I asked and was not given a specific answer, so I ordered the flavor with an iced latte. I get to the window and the guys are really nice, told me about the medium size that was cheaper than the small I got and I upgraded. However, the coffee I got was just a regular iced coffee. It tasted fine, but after repeating and asking if it was the creme brulee flavor, I was let down. I never got a receipt so instead of being able to take an online survey I called and talked to a manager. Before he got on the phone he was telling the employee who answered the phone that he couldn't do anything about it but he'll talk to me. How generous.   I told him what happened and he tried to reason that the deal I got was a better price than what I got, which I wasn't squabbling over price. I just wanted to try the seasonal flavor they were offering. He told me if I came back in he'd make it right. I decided to give them another try and waited another 5 minutes for him to come out of where he was only to be met with an expression of confusion. He made me a small creme brulee coffee and it was so gross... There was nothing in that coffee that even hinted at caramelized sugar. It tasted like burnt, sour coffee from the previous day. So gross I had to toss it after a few sips.  I hate to say it, but I'm done with this location. The people are very nice, but the donuts are shoddily decorated, the coffee is disgusting, the dining area is full of ripped chairs and wobbly tables, and I'm tired of wasting my time and money here."}

First:  the food.    I got a salad with a sandwich, and while the sandwich was nothing to write home about, and the salad itself was redolent of red onion that had been taken off, the dressing was freaking delicious.   I think they load it up with paprika and some sort of honey mustard.   Not really anything I'd have ever tried otherwise, and that was fantastic.     The food is meh.   The pastries are substandard.  The service is slow, the guys that have been behind the counter are completely anti social unless you're a hipster or a bike nerd. I'm not ragging on either of you groups; but I fit squarely outside of both these categories.  Second:  the chai.   OMGWTFPOWDERED CHAI.    This is the most disgusting thing I never knew I didn't want to exist.   And for $4, are you kidding me??  Third:   Don't ask about bicycles if you are a novice and the tall dude with the high prescription glasses and the almost dreads is there.   He will look at you with his superior bike knowledge, dismiss your Mom outfit and your moderately priced purse not made of canvas or ripstop with no reflective properties to it whatsoever and treat you like a disdained child who crapped on his floor.     I wanted to research bikes for my kids and this guy is just wildly unapproachable, weird, and haughty, which goes for pretty much most of the staff in there unless you walk in WITH A BIKE HELMET AND SKINNY PANTS.  Also, bike tires stink when you're hungry."}

Thus, I was surprised with the overall low scoring review.   Don't get me wrong, the wait times can be pretty long ranging from 10-15 mins, but when we want Starbucks it is what it is.   I think the baristas are very friendly and are willing to correct a mistake if needed. For example, one time my iced espresso was made with 4 pumps of pumpkin syrup instead of my requested 1 pump; however, once I alerted them, they fixed it without a problem.   IF want to grab a quick coffee, this Starbucks may not be your best option. For that, head to the market just south.

But that was all in my imagination, I think.  I have since become a regular algebra-goer, coming here at least once a week for my fill of delicious coffee, tea, and authentic Mediterranean food  Owned and built by a Case alum, this gem of a tea house really delivers on uniqueness, authenticity, and atmosphere. With their one of a kind handmade tables, cups, wooden plates, artwork, they really leave their mark as one of the coolest coffee houses in Cleveland  You really can't go wrong with any of their food, I am a big fan of their falafel and shawarma. Their hummus is also very good, but a little tame for me, I like my hummus more offensive with more lemon and a tad more garlic, but that's just a preference thing. Algebra is also very vegan friendly and has a large assortment of healthy menu options. Isn't it a great feeling to finish a big meal and still feel healthy afterwards?  Their drinks are not for the average venti-mocha-frappuccino-with-extra-whipped-cream 'coffee' sippers. As is the food, the drinks are authentic and are generally not too sweet, if at all.   If you are unsure of what to order, I recommend the chai tea and perhaps the falafel sandwich as starters  My only gripe with this place is that they aren't too consistent because they have a different person working there almost everyday, all of whom have their own slight variations on food and drink prep, so if you liked the chai tea you had Monday morning, you might not like it as much Wednesday night.  But this place delivers on so many other aspects, that I can't bring myself to give them anything below a 'as good as it gets' So come check this place out, order an iced chai tea with falafel sandwich, you won't be disappointed!

I was at the St Viateur cafe on Mont Royal this morning around 9:30am with a friend of mine visiting from out of town.  After we were done our breakfast, he went up to pay at the cash register and came back to the table with the change (it was about 9,50$ in change from 40$). He put down the tip (about 15%, which was fair given that our server only refilled our coffee once even though only 4 tables were occupied and she overfilled his cup and shrugged instead of apologizing).  Like many people, I don't like my tip sitting there looking all obvious while I am still finishing my last sips of coffee before leaving, so we put the tip money beside the plate that I had just finished eating from.   As we were walking out of the restaurant, the waitress stopped me and said very loudly 'You know...tip is not included in the bill...'. I was taken aback. One, she said this loud enough so that my friend heard as well as the table that was directly beside where I was standing.  Tipping is actually optional, not mandatory, but that is beside the point; we did tip: 15% and had she been paying attention and not jumping to conclusions, she would have easily seen this tip sitting right there, all ready for her.  You can bet that I will never be bringing any clients, friends or anyone by this establishment again. I am not sure if this is just a jaded server or what, but her behaviour was completely unacceptable, uncalled for and downright rude."}

One nice thing about this location is that it has a small outdoor patio with roughly 10 tables.  A word of warning though is not to avoid going on lunch hour or between 2:30-5 because there's a local highschool and the kids flock there and fill it up pretty quickly."}

They were a variety of coffee cups and mugs presented in such a way as to look inviting. I thought it was a nice touch.   Well, my turn came and I realized just how slow the cashier was. It was as if she had not a care Umbria world. After a few moments she finally took my order. Another woman actually made my coffee quickly, and I was headed to work.

Anyway, here's the lowdown of what I had:  1) Drink: Mocha. Very strong espresso flavor and not too sweet which was really great to wake me up on a Saturday morning!  2) Main: Matcha pancakes - I am a huge matcha fan so I had a lot of expectation for this. Unfortunately I can only say this is very meh for me - the pancakes were pretty dry and there could really be more fruit garnish   3) Snack: Being the biggest pistachio fan, I really wanted to try the pistachio loaf - but haven't been hearing good things so I tried the Lavender instead. Boy oh boy this was an amazing choice, the Lavender loaf was heavenly cold or warm! Would absolutely reco this!   I would definitely come back to try all the other amazing-sounding brunch items :)"}

Due to their popularity and the size of the cafe - there are times when you're going to have to wait, and if you show up with 20 people on a Saturday night...well uh...good luck. That said, it's worth it.  The $5 sit fee is quite reasonable with walls chocker block with games to choose from. Best of all are the staff. They're absolutely awesome. Even when it's ridiculously busy, someone has always come round to check up on us, offer game recommendations and taken the time to explain new and unfamiliar games in layman's terms to us.  Overall, super enjoyable experience to have people working there who are genuinely enthusiastic about board games and sharing that knowledge and interest.  It's also incredibly refreshing (as much as I love my WiFi and laptop), to go to a cafe that is *social* and doesn't have people moodily sitting in corners trying to hide their oh-so-precious-private-interneting.

{"bus_id":"Ycp3Agr7dt71TZkeKV7jng", "text":"ugh I really wish I don't have to leave a bad review for this place. I have been coming here for years and I have brought in so many more customers for this place personally that I introduced this place to all my close friends when they would always walk by n straight to Starbucks next door . This place was shut down for 3 months due to not able to pay store rent in 2009-2010,i try to help n come more.  I hv had 2 separated incidents in this place that disgruntle  employees are being rude. First time was in summer, when I just adopted a small Yorkie puppy that he was only 4 months old weight 4 pounds at time. when I was looking into the store window, a couple at patio liked my puppy so much offered to look after him at end side of patio in exchange that they get to pat him. my puppy is very small dude and he doesn't bark or bite. So instead of tying my puppy to the patio pole I left to the couple who's enjoying coffee at their patio chair. I quickly ran in to try to get my big usual chocolate chunk cookie asap but there was a line up that I had to line for about 5 minutes. During that time I kept checking on puppy on the patio window trying to make sure everything is okay. I got the cookies n were about to come out, a women (first I thought was a man first) with very shirt hair like buzz cut came up screaming (in a very public harsh n grunting voice, EXTREMELY DEGRATING) : 'YOU KNOW YOU ARENT ALLOWED TO HAVE DOGS IN PATIO?' I was in shock wasn't because I was wrong was it was so unforsceen n someone shouted at me out of nowhere in public. The line of people standing beside me were like'what's going on'. She rambled something else after in the same mannar, I don't remember what she said but was definitely VERY SELF RIGHTES AND CONDESENDING, her face reassemble with some with heartrate. I quickly grab my stuff n left . Feeling very HURT. I brought in SO MANY more customers when I developed a liking to this place. I brought at least 10 friends here to have them try this place n telling how good their cookeis are. And what I got was being LECTURED IN FRONT OF MASS AUDIANCE! I thought it was fine I had my puppy tied up in patio , he was pocket size clearly would do no harm. I only had him for a month it was my first dog I had no idea about patio laws prior. Just come up pull me aside to give me heads up, instead of yelling cross the room in public! This is Canada for god sake, what are ppl's manners.   I didn't come to the bakery for a month after that incident. Just left a very sour taste after that time n makes me cringe every time I walk by the store.   Finally time heals wounds, one day I passed by I decided to bring some cookie to friends and I walked in. I mentioned an employee n asked who was that short hair manly person that's so angry. Not saying trying to bash her looks, u really have no idea if she is a man or not just by looking at her. They confirmed that she is a chef at location, not the boss, also a VERY grumpy person to work with n didn't know why she would come to the front to yell at customers because she was suppose to stay at back. So I left at that assume she was having a bad day and came to the front and saw something she didn't like n happened to yell at me.   Second incident is its a few months apart, I came in one day before store closing. They had full tray of baked pear and apple pastries. I was normally getting a cookie but decided to take a tart too. The lady was annoyed when I asked her how much it was, it was mildly annoyed. Then I kinda debated between the two tarts, when I finally decided to go with pear, she grabe me a small dry piece from the edge of the tray. I don't like dry pastries so I asked her to switch to a middle piece. then she tried to shovel the tart n cookie in the same white small tinny paper bag I had to request please put them in separate bag, and toss in a plastic bag too because their pastries are greasy n they always soak through paper bag . She was increasingly irritated n I could tell she was thinking I gave her hard time on purpose. The final bill came $8.91 something which was like wow! for a cookie and small piece pear thing! I double asked her how much it was for the tart, she was like : $4.99. when I say the tart. I guess its called tart, its like 2.5x2.5 x0.8 inch high flaky crossant like texture pastry. it was like $5.61 I ate the whole thing in 4 bites. I was suspicious of if she over charged me so I asked how much it was she said :'$5.99  last night I came to the location to get a cookie they had the exact same thing and she was there too. after I bought a cookie I asked her how much that pear pastry was. she was like:$3.99! Bang   This place has great pastries and great coffee. However I would not want to stay here. They seem to have high turn over of store front employees who don't take their job seriously. They also have angry employee at back comes to front to throw a tantrum at 'young looking face' customers. Its totally not acceptable."}

Usually I like my coffee dark and I don't like sweet coffee, but it was pretty delicious. It had hints of cinnamon on the whip cream and through out the coffee itself. When I judge coffee, it's either I like it or I don't. I will say it is loaded with sugar, but enough sugar. It's not overwhelming.

Being newbies, we asked what everyone ordered and the answer was 'sesame' and there was a pile of them coming out of the oven with just a slight hint of burn and crisp. You pick up a few single serving Philadelphia cream cheese pads from the fridge and pay less than a buck for a fresh bagel.  The warmth of the bagel combined with just the right amount of chew puts any west coast US bagel to shame. We made a mistake of ordering some raisin bagel which was from a pile that was obviously out much longer so that one was a bit harder and colder and more normal.

I ordered four meals and several pastries from the case. When I was checking out I mentioned that I was to get a side and bagel option with the Benedict I ordered, per their menu online(see picture). Two girls told me no before they asked the manager, Jeremy/Jerry. Who said no but go a head and give it to her, I said thank you. He proceeds to get a menu to point it out. I said ok just to let you know your menu online says that all eggs and omelet dishes come with a choice of sides stated and a bagel. (All in the same section of the Benedict's). He said it comes with an English muffin but I'm not going to make a big deal out of a bagel and that he's never had anyone ask for the bagel. I don't respond because I know better and he agreed to give me the bagel. But I think to myself well I understand that a Benedict comes with an English muffin, I'm not stupid but the menu didn't state a bagel for a substitute. The girl ringing me out said oh the online menu? Well what this guy doesn't know is that I've worked in and managed places very similar to this and I know when a cashier is sympathizing with a customer. They obviously have had this complaint before also by the way he immediately got defensive.   So I pay $75 AND tip (not to mention the $8.25 for a 'large' side of fruit that was a mere pint) and we leave. As were walking out the door I hear ma'am, like I've forgotten a bag. Ha nope! It's the manager coming outside to argue some more. (My BF said after we left that when he came out the manager said I didn't want to argue with you inside....uhhh how about not at all) He tries to speak but I say to the BF let's go and he starts going on and on and I walk around the BF to walk away and the manager says 'ridiculous' as he's wailing back in. Ummmm NNO!!! I turn around, open the door and say that was uncalled for and walked away. He comes out again and says next time you can get a bagel instead of the English muffin. Well Manager of the Year, there won't be a next time!!   Ok so! So many things wrong with this!! First of all a manager following me outside to argue with a customer!!! Outside!! Over a bagel!!! You seriously have nothing better to do? I never had time to do that when I was a manager nor was it something I wished to do and seek out. He was so mad about giving me a bagel he steamed over it and still felt he hadn't said enough!   Second, let me inform some of you who might not know...those bagels you pay $2.00 and then some only cost about $.25 to make. Hmmm customer comes to my store spends $75, makes a valid point about what your crappy online menu says, give $.25 bagel to make customer happy. Most restaurant managers know the common sense in that!   I seriously couldn't say enough about this!  Uncalled for. Unprofessional. A frequent customer is now a nonexistent. I'm not happy about refusing to have their pastries!! But not worth giving any more of my money to them!!"}

I heard the server apologize to at least three tables (but not to me).  She told one guy the toaster burned his cinnamon raisin bagel (the last one in the shop) and insisted repeatedly that SHE didn't burn it--it was the toaster's fault.  Quiche was tasty, though.  The server said it was mushroom and spinach, so I had to wonder for a minute what the bright red things in my quiche were...then, I figured out it was mushroom and chard.  Coffee was 'eh.'  The floor looked dirty.  There was a paper towel in the toilet.  Ok, I'm nit-picking now.  The place was moderately busy; the small private parking lot was full.

The place was packed with a serious line outside until at least 10 - 10:30 pm.  Of course we were here to try the famous shaved ice. We shared a mango and a green tea shaved ice between 4 people and I have to say - they were TASTY. Perhaps it was the novelty of a huge pile of frozen sugar, but I enjoyed the add-ons such as popping boba, grass jelly, and ice cream on top. Portion sizes are BIG - definitely a dish to share with a fellow sweet-tooth. Otherwise, they offer pretty standard bubble tea shop fare.  The service was  a little lacking as it took a long time for the servers to give us menus, the food took a long time to come, and they only gave us each a half cup of water (in paper cups to boot - RIP trees).  The Kennedy location was hard to find as it is located inside a multilevel plaza that is off a side street (no major intersection).

Found out there's no tapioca, which is disappointing considering that's one of the most popular toppings.   Waited an hour and 15 minutes before our snow ice came and it was a completely incorrect order, which meant waiting another 30 minutes.   We waited a total of 2 hours before our correct order arrived, which didn't include the tapioca disappointment.   Would not recommend simply because of the horrible service."}

But there were even grander prizes like a flat screen tv, BBQ grills, and 7-11 gift cards. With that said, clearly 7-Eleven wants you to know that your friendly good neighbor is town!

The reason I say that is because people seem to be confused as to what Makers & Finders Coffee in Downtown summerlin is due to the positioning of the space and the 'name'.  But what you do find is that these makers don't just whip up a tasty fresh cup of Joe. They come through when its crunch time. After breakfast and before lunchtime. Yes that would be Brunch time. All you guys with girlfriends or wives who love brunch and a hot French press in Downtown Summerlin vs. your regular pancake and omelette house vibe, here you go !  if you are  by yourself there's a place at the bar with power outlets or if you brought the pup with you they have a dog friendly patio too.   The Coffee & Tea & Espresso Bar  Cafe con Leche , Cold Brew  They even have a Slow Bar which focuses on quality for all the coffee nerds out there Siphon , Aeropress the works!   They Serve Japanese Matcha Too !   We tried the Mexican spice Latte & The Honey Vanilla Latte while reading the menu.   Now on to the food.   I wasn't sure what to order and know I love me some chilaquiles, i asked the server if I was heading in the right direction and he assured me with confidence I was heading down a great path. The texture of the chips and consistency of crunchiness along with the rest of the flavor of the black beans avocado over easy egg you get the idea! I've had this dish hundreds of time all over the country and throughout Mexico  and these were great.   We also ordered the nova lox Benny and it was delicioso! Heaven in every bite I'm getting hungry all over again just thinking about it!   As i mentioned before Some people may be confused about this place as I was initially , they should probably have more than one hostess one taking names and one seating people when it gets really busy and perhaps explaining to the guest they can just go get coffee at the coffee bar or have their name put down for some grub."}

Their French onion soup is impeccable; I'll get that again for sure. I found the mac and cheese slightly underseasoned, but if you prefer your mac oven-baked and creamy then this is right up your alley.

We both had omelettes, which were fluffy and delicious, with tasty fillings.  I can always tell a good omelette when the cook takes the time to saute and soften the vegetables before filling the omelette.

I was visiting the store today to check and make sure that my kids had made it there safely since it was their first time walking there alone. When my friend and I walked in, we spotted my kids getting a slurpee,so we proceeded to walk up to them. There was a pretty long line, and we had to walk by a few guests in line, but when doing so, I felt someone's eyes on me.I then started walking faster to get by this man,and as I'm walking he's spinning around, and looking at me up and down.I first made a face at him which I thought would make him stop, but when he didn't, I yelled out 'WOW!' I couldn't believe that anyone could be any more disrespectful to make someone feel so uncomfortable like this man did. My friend was upset and told the guy that he was rude, and that upset the guy. He immediately got defensive,and wanted to 'take it outside' as he repeated more than twice. An employee finally noticed the commotion, and told my friend that he was '86'd' because he felt that he started everything, which was untrue. He was sticking up for me, and when I tried to tell the employee what really happened, he said that I was no longer allowed to shop there either. Meanwhile, my friend got a drink thrown at him, and his hat hit off of his head by this disrespectful man and his two friends and nobody told them a thing. I told my kids to put down their snacks, and to get to the car.But while making our way to the exit, we got split up and my kids were afraid to walk by the men to get to me.I told them to go ahead and walk past me and held the door, and while they walked by, one of the guys looked my son up and down.He then tried to fight my friend outside, and nobody did anything. I only heard one guy say to stop.There were even undercover officers who sat in their car, and didn't do anything right away like they should have. They got out of the car after a few minutes and flashed their badges.  I can care less about not being able to shop there. There's another 7Eleven less than a mile away.I'm not the one losing anything except respect for people who allow perverts to get away with things like this. And now I've seen the incident has been posted on social media, which violates me even more. So, I don't mind taking my business elsewhere. That's money lost for them, especially since I'm there almost everyday, sometimes more than once! I'LL NEVER GIVE THIS STORE MY MONEY!"}

{"bus_id":"qQCsLGMncJp1xWUGnOKCQA", "text":"READ THIS FIRST:  If you are looking for a high volume, quick place to get a massive quantity of coffee, and a huge indoor space to stretch out and sit for hours using their WiFi, this is NOT the place for you.    For the past 2 years my husband and I drove past the little place at 32nd Street and Shea wanting to try it.  However, we were addicted to the green mermaid and her infinite helpings of caffeinated drinks.  We could get in and get out without much interaction from the staff or clientele.  After speaking to several people who work in the area, we decided to stop in one Saturday morning for a mini-date.  It was the best choice we've made with regards to restaurants in a very long time.    This place is small, dark and cozy, with an eclectic menu, music, vibe, and customer base.  Now, reading other reviews, we noticed that there was a common theme: people who sat themselves and waited for employees.  When you enter the establishment, there is a bar and cashier where all ordering is done.  No one will come to your table with a menu.  When we entered we were greeted immediately.  The menu is behind the bar, so we stood checking out our possibilities.  The space is small, so people patiently wait in line inside and outside.  We ordered the Mexican Burrito, the Croissant Sandwich, and the green apple and brie danish to split.  The burrito was flavorful, as was the croissant sandwich.  But the green apple and brie danish blew our socks off.  We had two drinks: the hot mocha and a cold white chocolate mocha and lavender freezachino.  Yes, I said lavender.  It is an incredibly refreshing summer drink.    We sat ourselves and waited for our food.  The restaurant was about half full with regular patrons whom the owner and staff greeted by name.  Within a half-hour it was packed. People sat both inside and on the outside patio.  When the customer migration slowed, we had a chance to talk to the owner.  We complimented her food and ambiance.  32 reminds us of some of the coffee places we stop at in San Francisco:  great food, great vibe, great people, all local.  The second time we came for lunch.  We ordered the Le Grande Tuna and the Juicy Roast Beef.  Both great sandwiches, but the roast beef is now a favorite.  It is a warm roast beef with melted Munster cheese, creamy horseradish sauce on a Ciabatta roll.  To die for!  I had the lavender white mocha again and my husband had the caramel freezachino.  So far we can say  we have not been disappointed with any of the food or drinks.  The coffee never tastes burnt!  I can't say that about other places.  They have a local roaster where they get their coffee and he does a fantastic job.  This time we sat at the bar.  There were 4 or 5 of us.  Pretty soon we were all talking to each other and the wait staff.  Human interaction?  Who knew it could be that good?  We are now regulars.  We have realized that there are limitations to the order and serving process, simply because of the size of the establishment.  Once you get past that, you will realize what a little gem this is.  32 also has a drive through.  It is nothing to see 2 cars patiently waiting for some one to run their order out.  I think the key word is PATIENCE.  If you want something quick and snappy, please don't punish this place with your bad review.  The second word to consider is LOCAL.  If you want the quick menus with prepackaged food, move on.  The food is really good and meant to be enjoyed. Why only 4 stars, we have not tasted everything on the menu nor have been there in the evening. Also, it is tiny.  I can't really fault them though for that.   When we return for an evening date and finish the menu, I will gladly switch my rating.**  So, sit down, relax and stay a while.  Order first though and be reminded that good things come to those who wait.  **Added 8/2013  Yesterday was my birthday.  With the least amount of personal detail, I shall say that I have a history for sucky birthdays. I have come to avoid them as much as possible.  For this birthday, however, we were going to start a new tradition and try make them better.  I began my day at 32.  Once again, the food was fabulous.  The honey, apple and brie danish causes me to have cravings even now.  What made me change my star count wasn't the meal itself, but what I experienced.  Barista Luke first greeted me with a big  'Happy Birthday!'  Apparently, my husband told him the day before and he remembered.  Then, as we were leaving the owner, Rebecca, and Barista Paul came out from behind the counter and gave me a great big birthday hug.  I was so touched. Two of my siblings failed to contact me on my birthday, but I got a group hug at 32.  These people have become my friends. They watch out for me.  The know my children. Every meal is filled with greetings, good conversation and friendly banter.  The food is great, but the people are amazing!  If that's not worth a 5th star, I don't know what does."}

I am not really a fan of the metal chairs they have, they look cool but aren't very comfortable. If possible, sit on the cushy couch in the corner. And it's not JUST a bakery. You can also get wine here!!  The staff has always been extremely helpful when I have gone in. On my last visit I was picking up a box of treats to share with some girlfriends and the lady that helped me had so many great suggestions as to what I should get. I ended up with 3 macarons  and 3 cupcakes, all of which my friends raved about later that evening.  Personally, I have had and really enjoyed the 'haute' chocolate, the salted caramel cupcake and the arnold palmer macaron. I love that the ladies at GSS are always coming up with new and inventive creations for their bakery case. Where else will you find a fig and goat cheese macaron?!   Two things prevent me from giving GSS a 5 star review:  1. Bigger isn't always better. I would definitely prefer the macarons if they were smaller. I know that there have been times that GSS has offered smaller macarons, and I wish they'd make that a regular occurrence.   2. They are closed to the public on Mondays."}

The first time i came with my husband to meet up with our friend and we go their bugoggi ( i think thats how you spell it) sandwhich, and one of their appetizer the popcorn chicken. Well let me start off by saying that the appetizer was nothing but breading didnt have much meat on them and taste like it was store bought.   The sandwhich wasn't that good neither, the sandwhich didn't have much flavor. To me it was salty and there was hardy any veggies on the sandwhich or meat. The sandwhich had only 2 strips of meat. Tonight i went there to get me some drink and i got hungry so i got me a grilled pork sandwhich but this sandwhich had no flavor either and just like the other sandwhich it only had 2 strip hardy any veggies.

We were told this was the best restaurant in the city but i surely did not think so and neither did half my freinds.  Our waiter was very nice and the outside seating was nice.  We were able to get a large table under the tent closest to the road so it felt a little more secluded.  I ordered the crab leg appetizer and found that it was very over cooked and rubbery and tasted as if they were cooking it with kerosine.  Then i ordered the halibut and the only thing i really enjoyed becasue my fish was over cooked was the mashed potatoes it sat on.  Their mixed specialty drinks were horrible.  Stick with wine cuz they cant screw that up at least lol.  All in all i would not recommend this place to anyone.  They do not do well with larger partys since half our table got our food and the other half waited 20 minutes before theirs arrived.  So we were sitting there with our food getting cold waiting for the rest of the people to be served.  Also i am not sure what is with Arizona water but UGH gross.

I cleaned the washroom before I used it as some asshole peed on the seat grr..  Old food and beverage server day kicked in,  and I had to leave it clean for the next person.  Great alternative to a club, and there's a lot of games to choose from.  We had a lot of laughs, and was sad when their coffee machine shut down at 10pm, as we were there until 2am.  That's a loss of sales for the venue, as we would have kept buying cappacinos."}

We had to wait when we went and just had a very enjoyable time. Wish I had one closer to home. I suggest the nutella latte with a splash of liquor :)"}

They knew their stuff and made many suggestions on what to order.   While I don't care for Boba, due to staff being so friendly, knowledgeable and keeping the store super clean, I am giving them 5 stars! If you like Boba, I highly suggest you check this place out! My friends that do like Boba, advised that this place is the best."}
{"bus_id":"_J_x_RaYTqAqAuCwgRhnRQ", "text":"I came here one night to see a DJ play. It's an interesting place in a rather blah location. The parking lot is torn up, it's not easy to get to and it's kind of run down inside. The hookah gets overwhelming for me, but there are plenty of couches/chairs in the back. The DJ was good given what he had to work with and he got people dancing. So all of that does not equal 3 stars. What does jump it up to 3 starts is the food. The kabobs were amazing melt in your mouth. They were out of chicken so we got steak and definitely good food. The hummus was good as well. Overall due to location I probably wouldn't come back unless someone really wanted to go, however if you are in the area or live near there definitely give the food a try as it's really good."}

Everything is pre-made and al la carte. The only downside is their selection is pretty small and since everything is pre-made you can't omit or add anything. Their house made potato chips are some of the best chips I've had.  They do have an awesome selection of desserts.  If you're not already downtown I wouldn't go out of my way to stop here. Parking downtown is too much of a pain."}

My sister lives in bloor west village and since she had moved here, this has become my favorite place to hit up some coffee and baked goods in the morning during my visits.  My sister is an addicted regular...she visits two or more times a day.  My recommendations are their seasonal pumpkin spice latte they have right now during the fall season...the LOW FAT WILD BLUEBERRY MUFFIN TOP is to DIE for....chewy and cock full of blueberries...absolutely DELICIOUS!!! mmmmmmmmm"}

Ordered my small (3 small tiers), overpriced ($800) simple wedding cake (gold fondant with real flowers WE PROVIDED, sprinkled day of - that's it) only for it to be delivered 1) late 2) with the top layer smashed in & not fixed 3) flowers sitting on cake table & just left there (not even attempted to be put on). Didn't even say a word to us day of. When we made our disappointment evident after the wedding, they only offered the $50 delivery charge refunded & were snotty about it. REALLY?! Thanks to 2 of my wedding guests who saw the mess & fixed it as best they could before I walked in. First & only time I will ever use or recommend them."}

The atmosphere and service is LEAGUES above shitty 'Chat Time', and their selection is amazing. They even offer free popcorn once you sit down. Finally a bubble tea shop that is reminiscent of the classic ones from Richmond Hill."}

Staff is very helpful - but not in your face...  Lots of bikes from bmx to cruiser - and from very modestly (read: low) priced to high end stuff.  Parts, upgrades, expert advice...  All kinds of surprises - gear - books - board games - etc...  Great concept executed well.  Plus, some of the walls are my favorite shade of green...    Dammit.  Now I'm hungry.  For quiche.  Stupid Trailhead, you should be open 24 hours."}

The environment was great and the service was good (the only reason I gave them any stars) but the food and coffee were terrible. We ordered the beet burger which was fresh but utterly flavorless; the biscuits and gravy lacked not only spice but just salt and the biscuits were hard and cold; and the chorizo tacos had beautiful presentation but were tiny and again lacking any flavor. Won't be back."}

I love the outdoor seating with the trees shading off the entire patio and the fountain which adds a nice feel to it. Not to mention it's a drive through!"}

{"bus_id":"Mh9pUksi_zukLdwDlgG7BA", "text":"I don't usually buy take away coffee from chains because I think they wouldn't know a decent cup of coffee if it hit them in the face. When I see a line of 20+ people at Starbucks I wonder if it is a figment of my imagination.  Anyway the main chain choices here in Toronto are Tim Hortons (which EVERYONE seems obsessed with), Starbucks and Timothys. Well following word of mouth I went into Tim Hortons but alas they do not have soy milk so over the road I went to try this joint. I got a soy mocha in the medium size (I forget the silly size name they had for it). It was pretty decent tasting and a good ratio of chocolate to coffee to milk (which Starbucks cannot master).  So yes two thumbs up...better than Starbucks and a black coffee at Tim Hortons (or so I would imagine). It will cost you five plus dollars but if you frequent these places you probably already knew that!"}

Food:  Popcorn chicken: crispy and flavourful. Best dish from what we had. B+  Coffee toast with tapioca: disappointed. The picture looked good, but I couldn't taste the coffee flavour. There wasn't a lot of tapioca on the bread itself like in the pic, but the tapioca was flavourful and soft.  The bread was pretty hard but I think it was fried. C-  Brown sugar milk tea: very sweet, but good flavour. Would ask for a sugar reduction next time. B  Slim beauty herbal tea: not much flavour. Couldn't taste the rose at all. Wouldn't order again. C  The shaved ice looked good, but I couldn't handle the milk today. May come back and try that next time, but overall, there's other better bbtea places out there."}
{"bus_id":"bcJmbFHVAkLFqhJbUTdbyQ", "text":"I am so thankful to have found this place!!  I was in a real rut trying to find a last minute birthday cake for my husband. (I know, my fault for procrastinating)   I had called around to several bakeries to see if I they had anything ready to serve that same day but to no avail. I found Crown on yelp and decided to give them a try. I was floored by their gorgeous bakery, their selection of cakes, their designs and most of all their prices!   I purchased a single tier (huge single tier) chocolate cake and they even personalized it for me for under $30.   It was the most delicious cake I have tasted in a very, very long time. The young lady that helped me though my whole cake crisis ( I forget her name, otherwise I would mention her) from beginning to end was so lovely.   I must make special mention of their cake carry-out boxes. They are that most genius thing ever. NOTHING will happen to your cake in one of those bulletproof boxes!!  They also included candles and a plastic cake cutting knife which I though was a nice gesture on their behalf. I cannot say enough about this bakery. I will definitely be returning. Thank you so much!!"}
